The incident reflected a stark rise in shootings in the city. By Ali Watkins and Nate Schweber One woman was killed and six other people were wounded, including a 14-year-old girl, when at least two people opened fire at a house party in Brooklyn on Sunday night, the police said. The shooting took place at about 11:17 p.m. at 15 Albany Avenue in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, at a gathering attended by many young people and teenagers. A 20-year-old woman was shot and later died at Woodhull Medical Center, the police said. The 14-year-old girl was struck in the buttocks and was rushed to Maimonides Medical Center, where she was in stable condition. The other victims included a 16-year-old boy, who was hit in the torso and was in critical condition at King County Hospital Center, and a 15-year-old boy, who was shot in the leg and was in stable condition at Maimonides, the police said. Three others were wounded but were expected to survive: an 18-year-old woman shot in the leg, an 18-year-old man also struck in the leg and a 19-year-old man hit in the torso, the police said. The motive for the shooting remained unclear. Shootings have doubled this year in New York City over last year, with at least 1,660 incidents, and murders have risen by about 37 percent, to about 400. “We’re seeing a tremendous uptick that has us concerned,” Assistant Chief Judith Harrison, who oversees the police department’s Brooklyn North command, said at an overnight news conference. The party at Albany Avenue appeared to be a continuation of an earlier gathering for a “Sweet 16” celebration that had been broken up around 7 p.m. at a hall in East New York, the police said. Not long after that party dispersed, a 17-year-old boy who had attended was shot in the leg a block and a half from the hall, the police said. He was expected to survive. The police believe two gunmen arrived to 15 Albany Avenue at around 11 p.m. and opened fire outside the front entrance. They then walked into the lobby and continued firing as they walked upstairs to the third floor, the police said. Detectives believe the two shootings are connected, said Deputy Chief Michael Kemper, who oversees the detective bureau in Brooklyn North, where the shooting took place. “It could be a retaliatory shooting or it could be a continuation,” Chief Kemper told reporters at the news conference. Borough President Eric Adams of Brooklyn said that the mass shooting stemmed from a dispute that began at the East New York party hall. “A beef that started in East New York spilled over here,” he said. One resident of 15 Albany Avenue, Fred Waller, said he was returning to his apartment on the second floor at around 11 p.m., when he saw two people arguing in front of the building among a larger group of about 75 people. Mr. Waller said he also saw people partying inside the building. After he entered his apartment, he said he heard about a dozen gun shots ring out. He stayed hidden inside his apartment for a few minutes before looking out and spotting a young man with gunshot wounds slumped on the stairs as partygoers streamed out of the building. “This is out of control,” Mr. Waller said of the violence outside his door. A woman who was leaving the building on Monday morning said she was at a party on the fourth floor when a skirmish among a separate group of partygoers erupted on the third floor. She said she heard five shots. “I don’t know who was shooting,” said the woman, who did not want to be identified for safety reasons. James Wilson, who has lived across the street for a decade, said he came home around 10:30 p.m. and saw a crowd of around 30 young people in front of 15 Albany. The people he saw appeared to be happy and having fun, Mr. Wilson said. He added, however, that the building has previously been the site of disruptive parties where trouble has broken out. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
