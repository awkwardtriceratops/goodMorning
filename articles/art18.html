But staying inside has trade-offs too. By Molly Peterson Megafires are prompting a lockdown within a lockdown for millions of American children, as parents who have already curbed social activities in light of the threat of the pandemic seek to escape another potential health risk: smoke. Wildfire pollution has been spinning and curling over Western states, a byproduct of one of the deadliest and largest fire seasons on record. Winds push smoke tendrils from California, Oregon and Washington across county lines and state borders, and the jet stream can carry this pollution across the country. All this devastation is happening as kids return to school. In many states bedrooms are serving as classrooms, with lonely days of video instruction yielding to pent-up energy. So parents under these hazy skies are checking and rechecking air quality, looking for a window for kids to burn off some of that energy outside. Within smoke are fine airborne particles, smaller than the width of a single strand of hair. These particles, called “PM 2.5” for their size in micrometers, sneak past natural defenses in the lungs and bloodstream. Because small children breathe faster than adults, run around more and have developing immune systems, they’re more vulnerable to the ill effects of bad air. Fine-particle pollution isn’t good for anybody over the long term, but breathing it regularly threatens and exacerbates chronic health problems, including asthma, in children.
