By Kevin Draper Halfway through “Win at All Costs,” Matt Hart’s look at Nike’s sponsorship of professional running, the author offhandedly throws out a number. After the salaries of the dozen or so runners in the Nike Oregon Project — some of whom earned hundreds of thousands annually — were accounted for, the program’s expenses were “north of a million dollars” a year. Assuming that vague figure means about $1 million, it is an astonishingly small sum for a company that in 2008 (the year Hart refers to) generated $18.6 billion in revenue. The Nike Oregon Project was a vaunted attempt at nothing less than revitalizing American distance running and earning Olympic gold medals. It was featured on magazine covers at its launch in the early 2000s and, more recently, on the front pages of newspapers after its leader, Alberto Salazar, was banned by antidoping authorities and accused of belittling and mistreating women runners. Mark Parker, who recently retired as Nike’s chief executive, was implicated as an accessory to doping after his emails with Salazar, about testing the level at which testosterone creams would trigger a positive doping test, were made public. All for what amounted to a rounding error for one of corporate America’s titans. For those steeped in the story of Nike, Salazar and distance running, “Win at All Costs” does not provide the hoped-for new information. It does not definitively determine whether any Nike Oregon Project runners doped, or whether Salazar pursued a systematic doping program beyond the facts laid out by the United States Antidoping Agency when it banned him from the sport in 2019. It does not reveal the name of the confidential source who provided Hart with a draft of Usada’s report in 2017, which he turned into a front-page article for The Times. What the book does offer is an exhaustive chronicle of each major race, training camp and seemingly each training session Nike Oregon Project runners participated in for almost two decades, an exercise that left me feeling repeated sensations of déjà vu. “Win at All Costs” is not a history of Nike, but in the Oregon Project’s downfall you can see echoes of practically every scandal Nike has ever faced. Those scandals are chronicled in many previous books about Nike, including “Swoosh,” by J.B. Strasser and Laurie Becklund; “Bowerman and the Men of Oregon,” by Kenny Moore; “No Logo,” by Naomi Klein; “Cycle of Lies,” by Juliet Macur; “Out of Nowhere,” by Geoff Hollister; and “Shoe Dog,” by Phil Knight, one of Nike’s founders.
