New York’s Future May Ride on the Answer<br></h1><p id="artcont">The pandemic has reshaped the 2021 mayoral race, with the city’s economic and health challenges casting a shadow over social justice issues. By Emma G. Fitzsimmons, Dana Rubinstein and Jeffery C. Mays As much of New York City was consumed by the presidential election, a campaign for another critical race was already underway. Several mayoral candidates made a pilgrimage to Richard Ravitch, seeking his support and advice on confronting the city’s economic crisis. Mr. Ravitch, who helped save the city from bankruptcy in the 1970s, has made no endorsement, but Raymond J. McGuire, a Citigroup executive, seemed to have the inside track. Many more mayoral hopefuls are barraging labor leaders for their support, with one key union already committed: Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, landed an early endorsement from a union representing 45,000 retail workers. Nearly a dozen Democratic candidates are set to compete in June’s mayoral primary, a free-for-all that may be the city’s most consequential in a generation. The next mayor will confront enormous challenges in guiding the city out of the pandemic, and battling an economic crisis that has ravaged the city’s finances and left more than a half-million residents out of work. The race has already been transformed by the coronavirus and massive Black Lives Matter protests this year. Now the city is struggling to fend off a second wave of the virus, with schools closed again and further shutdowns threatened. For voters, the contest may boil down to a test of priorities: Do they want a mayor best suited to advance the city’s embrace of progressive policies, or someone best qualified to confront its dire economic concerns? It will be only the fourth time in roughly a half century that the ballot will not include an incumbent mayor seeking re-election: Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is in his seventh year in office, is barred by term limits from running again. Several candidates have worked in the de Blasio administration, yet the mayor’s residual unpopularity has given rise to an unusual trend: Most mayoral hopefuls are not necessarily running to the left or right of him, but just far, far away. The mayor was roundly criticized over his decision this week to close public schools after the rate of positive tests in the city hit 3 percent, the most conservative threshold of any big school district in the country. The positivity rate was far lower in schools though, and many of the candidates have faulted Mr. de Blasio for how he has handled the situation. Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president who is running for mayor, said the mayor’s decision would hurt Black and Latino children and low-income families the most. “New Yorkers deserve better than this confusing, unscientific approach to public education and public health,” Mr. Adams said.
