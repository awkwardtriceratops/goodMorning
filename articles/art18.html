Joe Biden’s team is bracing for ugly attacks. By Katie Glueck and Maggie Haberman Three weeks after a debate spectacle defined by heckling and sharply personal attacks, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and President Trump will meet again on Thursday in the last major prime-time opportunity for Mr. Trump to try to change the trajectory of the race before Election Day. Republicans would like to see the president offer an affirmative vision for the country and draw policy contrasts with Mr. Biden in terms that resonate with the few undecided voters remaining. But Mr. Trump, with his history of indiscipline and invective, has struggled to define Mr. Biden this year — and he is running short on time. The debate comes 12 days before Election Day, as many Americans have already cast ballots, and as polls show the president trailing nationally and confronting close races even in states he won handily four years ago. Mr. Trump’s advisers hope that he can get under Mr. Biden’s skin on Thursday at the debate in Nashville, which will begin at 9 p.m. Eastern. But they have also urged the president not to interrupt Mr. Biden repeatedly, after a first contest in which Mr. Trump constantly hectored his rival — and Mr. Biden told him to “shut up” — as the evening spiraled out of the moderator’s control. The president has signaled he intends to focus on Mr. Biden’s son Hunter and his business dealings, after an unsubstantiated New York Post report on that subject. But some advisers fear he will not be able to control himself and will attack the younger Mr. Biden in a way that engenders sympathy for the Biden family, a dynamic that unfolded in the first debate when Mr. Trump mocked Hunter Biden’s history of battling drug addiction. “The president, in order to have a successful debate, has to go on offense without being offensive,” said Brett O’Donnell, a Republican strategist who has coached candidates in debates. “The American people care more about their own family than they do about the family of Hunter Biden. Especially during the pandemic.” Mr. Trump has spent days attacking the Commission on Presidential Debates, which organizes the events and announced this week that the microphones of both candidates would be muted at times, as well as the moderators the commission has chosen. In an interview with “Fox and Friends” on Tuesday morning, the president continued along that path, but suggested he was listening to his advisers for now. “They said if you let him talk, he’ll lose his chain of thought,” Mr. Trump said. “But I also understand that as he’s going down the line and issuing lies, you know, generally it’s OK to, you know, really attack that.” Mr. Biden, for his part, is working to protect his advantage by relying on arguments that have defined his pitch for months: that he is the candidate best equipped to lead the nation out of the pandemic and its attendant economic fallout, and that he can restore stability and a measure of civility to the office after Mr. Trump’s turbulent tenure. He and his team, though, are bracing for ugly attacks, and some allies hope that the candidate, who is fiercely protective of his children, will avoid growing so angry onstage that he appears rattled. The Democratic nominee may also be pressed on a number of issues he has struggled to crisply address in the past. In particular, allies expect that he will face questioning on expanding the Supreme Court, a matter he has repeatedly dodged, though he has said that he will clarify his position before Election Day. “He’s going to be asked about the Supreme Court, and Trump will try to goad him about Hunter,” predicted John Morgan, an early Biden donor. “Because Trump knows that Joe Biden’s family is his hottest hot button.” As of Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump had two tentative, one-hour sessions on his schedule for some form of debate prep before Thursday night. But some advisers were skeptical that much would be accomplished, especially with such a reduced time frame. The debate prep sessions, such as they are, are expected to include different advisers from those who were involved before the first debate. Aides have also been preparing notes for him with subject matter he should raise, or be prepared for. Last week, Trump advisers tried gently suggesting, as they prepared him for his NBC town hall event with Savannah Guthrie, that he needed to be more controlled and less caustic than in the first debate. Aides claim he has processed that information, though he was combative and refused to disavow a conspiracy theory movement during the first part of that appearance, too. But his behavior in the second half of the town hall, during which he answered policy questions without attacking Ms. Guthrie, is what advisers hope to see from him on Thursday night. Mr. O’Donnell, the Republican strategist, suggested that Mr. Trump’s frequent interruptions in the previous debate prevented viewers from absorbing some of Mr. Biden’s shakier responses. “I don’t think either one of them did a good job in the debate,” he said, “because the president was so over the top he didn’t get a chance to have that contrast where Joe Biden gets mad or frustrated.”
