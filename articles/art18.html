JPMorgan Chase sent some of its workers home this week after an employee in its trading unit in Midtown Manhattan tested positive for the coronavirus, a person familiar with the matter told DealBook. The timing isn’t great. The news broke days after President Trump brought attention to the investment bank’s plan to bring some of its senior workers back to the office, inaccurately tweeting, “Congratulations to JPMorgan Chase for ordering everyone BACK TO OFFICE on September 21st. Will always be better than working from home!” (The bank had, in fact, only asked some senior employees in its sales and trading division to return.) Mr. Trump’s tweet politicized a decision that JPMorgan, and other companies, would probably like to make without such fanfare.
