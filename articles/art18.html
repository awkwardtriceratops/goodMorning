By Maureen Dowd Opinion Columnist WASHINGTON — We expected more of Donald Trump. An epic, Jack Nicholson-in-the-Overlook-Hotel meltdown, not just Rose Garden-variety mewling. A conspiracy with grandiosity, not merely pathetic blathering about pointless lawsuits from his entitled children and oddballs Rudy Giuliani and Richard Grenell. The president has had all this time to hatch a spidery plot to ruin democracy on the way out the door, and this is the best he can come up with? The election has been stolen! What’s your proof? Because I’m losing. This, from the man who has been hailed as an evil genius of media manipulation? Trump can’t hold a candle to the well-oiled machine — Jeb Bush, Katherine Harris, James Baker and the Supreme Court — that purloined the Florida vote, and thereby the presidency, for W. in 2000. It was the same old tired Trump routine we’ve watched for four years, right through the pandemic failure: Beat your chest and bleat that you’re king of the world. Then do nothing except screw up. But you can’t con your way past 74 million Biden ballots any more than you can con your way past a microbe. The masked Americans counting the vote just kept on counting, impervious to the president’s evidence-free conniptions. Trump campaigned hard and his coattails worked even if a lot of Republican voters were ready to hand him his hat.
