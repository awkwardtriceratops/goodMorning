By Gail Collins and Bret Stephens Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every week. Bret Stephens: Good morning, Gail. I was reading on social media that Osama bin Laden is alive and well and that he’s living inside Donald Trump’s brain. Care to comment? Gail Collins: Bret, we’ve spent a lot of time listening to Trump trying to destroy Barack Obama’s legacy. Obama didn’t save the auto industry — he did. Obama didn’t resuscitate the economy — he did. Obama didn’t fix health care for veterans — he did. Bret: And now, thanks to a Trump retweet of a bonkers-despicable-QAnon-linked conspiracy theory, we have: the United States didn’t actually kill Bin Laden, but Biden killed the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden’s body double. Eventually, “Jeopardy!” will have a category called “Trump’s Lowest Twitter Moment” and that will be the daily double. Gail: Lately, when he goes into one of those rants, I relax by picturing the moment when we get to say: “Obama got elected to a second term — you didn’t.” Bret: Inshallah. Gail: Speaking of the competition between Trump and Biden, what did you think of those town hall pseudo debates? Bret: I think they’re a public service. Biden continues to dispel the myth that he no longer has a brain. And Trump continues to dispel the myth that he’s ever had a heart. The more voters are reminded of these two facts between now and the election, the likelier we are to send Trump into permanent exile in Mar-a-Lago or wherever else he goes from here.
