By Jessica Grose I have spent the past week cleaning out my girls’ bedroom for the upcoming school year, unearthing relics from the before times. It feels like Pompeii; everything is frozen in place from Friday, March 13, the last day my children attended school in person. There were two particular artifacts that pushed me close to tears: a purple mesh bag from my younger daughter’s preschool that used to hold her nap sheets and stuffy, and a collection of three books from the “Puppy Place” series that my older daughter brought home from her classroom’s library. These objects reminded me how much my daughters loved school. Now there will be no cozy group naps or browsing shelves full of worn-in books. They also reminded me how much my girls did not love distance learning in the spring, and how anxious I am about another round of it this fall. Across the country, whether your kids are learning remotely, doing some hybrid of online and in-person, or back fully in-person, with new protocols like masks, social distancing and staying in only one classroom, school will most likely not look anything like it did in February.
