Beats RB Leipzig to Reach Champions League Final<br></h1><p id="artcont">CHAMPIONS LEAGUE: P.S.G. 3, RB LEIPZIG 0 A dominant performance gave the perennial French champions their first trip to the final of European soccer’s top club competition. By Rory Smith After all the wrong turns, all the heartache and disappointment, the humiliations and the turnarounds and the gut-wrenching collapses, Paris St.-Germain has finally done what it was designed and built to do. Nine years after it became home to one of the most expensive and ambitious projects in world soccer, the French champion has reached the Champions League final. Given the club’s recent history in this competition — its ability to snatch defeat when victory seemed assured, its many and varied ways of falling at the last hurdle — it did so in the most uncharacteristic manner imaginable: with no drama, no tension, and while barely breaking a sweat. P.S.G. cruised past its overmatched and inexperienced German opponent, RB Leipzig, by 3-0 in the first of the competition’s two semifinals on Tuesday night in Lisbon. Manager Thomas Tuchel’s team seized control with an early goal — a wonderful header from Marquinhos, its Brazilian defensive midfielder — and then doubled its advantage when Angel Di Maria seized upon a loose pass from Peter Gulacsi, Leipzig’s goalkeeper, and completed a quick sequence of passes involving two teammates. Leipzig’s vanishing hopes of a comeback disappeared early in the second half, when another defensive error allowed Juan Bernat to stretch P.S.G.’s lead to three. Though Leipzig offered an improved display in the second half, P.S.G. rarely seemed threatened; Neymar and Kylian Mbappé, the team’s twin stars, could afford to smile at missed chances or wasted opportunities. Either Bayern Munich or P.S.G.’s domestic rival, Olympique Lyonnais, awaits the French champions in the final on Sunday. Those teams will meet Wednesday in the second semifinal. Tuesday’s victory was the culmination of a project that began when Qatar Sports Investments, the Gulf nation’s sovereign wealth fund, took over the club in 2011, a move that has resonated across European soccer. P.S.G.’s squad is among the most costly ever assembled and includes, in Neymar, the most expensive player in the game’s history. Mbappé is second. But Champions League success like this year’s has been a long time coming. This was P.S.G.’s first appearance in the competition’s semifinals since 1995 — long before both the arrival of Qatari investment and the birth of Mbappé — and the club has, in recent years, developed a habit of falling short when faced with one of Europe’s giants. It has been eliminated by both Real Madrid and Manchester City in previous years; last season, it was eliminated by a last-minute goal by Manchester United. Most painful, of course, was the team’s 2017 elimination at the hands of Barcelona in the round of 16, on the strength of a stunning 6-1 defeat at Camp Nou after P.S.G. had cruised to a comfortable victory in the first leg at home. That defeat was orchestrated by Neymar; a few months later, P.S.G. more than doubled the previous world transfer record to bring the Brazilian forward to Paris. It was a signing with a single purpose: to transform the club that regularly competed in the Champions League into a team capable of winning it. Three years since the defeat, Neymar and P.S.G. are, at last, on the cusp of fulfilling that mission. Rory Smith and Andrew Das of The Times tracked the game in real time. To follow the game as it happened, read on: FULL TIME The whistle blows are two minutes of needless injury time and P.S.G. is through to the final. Goals by Marquinhos and Ángel Di María in the first half and a third by Juan Bernat early in the second half did it. 83’ Marco Verratti and Julian Draxler come on to see out the final few minutes. Ander Herrera and Leandro Paredes depart. Three minutes later Mbappé, with a sly wink, and Di María, less pleased, follow them off. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Pablo Sarabia come on. In Thomas Tuchel’s defense, there was nothing worth changing to this point. What a day it’s been as P.S.G. has absolutely cruised full speed into its first Champions League final.
