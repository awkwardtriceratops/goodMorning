By Carole Landry and Hiroko Masuike (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.  1.  Joe Biden assailed President Trump over the unrest in cities. As Mr. Trump prepared for a visit on Tuesday to Kenosha, Wis., which has been rocked by protests and riots over the police shooting of Jacob Blake, Mr. Biden gave a speech in Pittsburgh, above, asking: “Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is re-elected?” “Mr. Trump, you want to talk about fear?’’ Mr. Biden asked. “Do you know what people are afraid of in America? They’re afraid they’re going to get Covid. They’re afraid they’re going to get sick and die. And that is no small part because of you.” He noted that more police officers had died from the coronavirus than were killed on patrol. At a White House press conference later in the day,  Mr. Trump fired back. “The rioters and Joe Biden have a side — they’re both on the side of the radical left,” he said. The president has tried to make protests and riots his central issue, distracting from the pandemic that continues to kill roughly 1,000 Americans every day. Over the weekend, Mr. Trump unleashed an especially intense barrage of Twitter messages in which he embraced fringe conspiracy theories claiming that the coronavirus death toll has been exaggerated and that street protests amount to an attempted coup d’état against him.
