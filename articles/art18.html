By Jill Cowan Good morning. Whatever brief respite from the unending parade of disheartening news we might’ve been hoping for this long weekend was cut short on Friday when Los Angeles County officials announced the most restrictive lockdown in the state, banning all gatherings, public and private. That means that even before 10 p.m., when the state’s limited curfew goes into effect, residents of the county, far and away California’s most populous, aren’t allowed to gather with anyone outside their households, starting today. The new order will be in effect through Dec. 20. [Track California’s coronavirus cases by county.] It’s not quite as severe as the statewide stay-at-home order in March, nor was it much of a surprise. Schools and day cares that have been allowed to reopen can stay open unless they have outbreaks. Religious services and protests can still take place, and stores can continue to operate at limited capacity. And the county’s most contested move, to shut down outdoor dining, had already taken place. But the fact that Los Angeles officials set what sounded like a high threshold for additional restrictions — an average of 4,500 new cases per day in the county over five days — and the virus quickly rolled past it, underscores the sense that we’re hurtling down a hill, even though officials have pulled the emergency brake. [Read the full order from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.] A week ago, California reported 17,694 new cases, well more than any other state had done before, according to The New York Times’s database. Leaders have warned repeatedly that the holidays were on track to be dangerous.
