Saudi Arabia at the Crossroads

BLOOD AND OIL
Mohammed bin Salman’s Ruthless Quest for Global Power
By Bradley Hope and Justin Scheck One of my most embarrassing moments in government came in 1995. I was a young staffer at the National Security Council, and a terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia suggested growing unrest there. At an interagency meeting on the subject, I turned to the representative from United States  Central Command and asked when was the last time they had updated their contingency plan for internal conflict in the kingdom. It struck me as the right question to ask, the kind of thing that the N.S.C. was supposed to ask. It would have been unforgivable not to have asked it. But all of the older, wiser folks at the table looked at me as if I had just said to the general: “I’m going to douse myself with gasoline and strike a match. Would you like to join me?” Afterward, another graybeard pulled me aside and explained, impatiently: “We don’t have contingency plans for that. It would be like trying to make contingency plans for the Earth colliding with the sun.” Fast-forward a decade and I was having dinner with my friend Gideon Rose at a Chinese restaurant on Second Avenue in New York. Gideon is the editor of Foreign Affairs magazine and was among the first to recognize the impact of the shale oil revolution on America’s interests in the Middle East. He argued that fracking would soon render the Middle East strategically irrelevant. My response was that it someday might, but first it would drive down the price of oil and with it, the stability of all the sclerotic Middle Eastern states that had bought off their populations with sinecures and subsidies for so long. The key question was whether the eventual state collapses would come before or after the point when the world could live without Middle Eastern oil. That, in a nutshell, is our problem with Saudi Arabia. Fracking has knocked the legs out of the international oil market and helped make the tired old political-economic systems of the Muslim Middle East unsustainable. As the 2009 Green Movement in Iran and 2011 Arab Spring both illustrated, this is stirring the pot of revolution, civil war and other forms of internal upheaval all across the region. Virtually all of the states of the Middle East face a choice between reform or revolution, although many insist on clinging to repression instead. Unfortunately, revolution and civil war have proved the greatest threats to oil production. And the world is not yet ready to live without the unmatched reserves, enormous production and unique spare capacity of Saudi Arabia. All of the fracking in the world could not compensate for the loss of Saudi oil. Which is why Riyadh’s current course under King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman (M.B.S.), is so important to the United States. The dramatic transformation that M.B.S. is trying to bring about is exactly the right answer for the kingdom and what the United States needs to have happen there. Yet Saudi Arabia is a difficult ally. It is too important to be cast aside, but too different to fit easily with American values. And as readers of this newspaper know well, M.B.S. is a brash young autocrat who makes as many outrageous missteps as laudatory moves. He is as determined to reinforce the kingdom’s authoritarian politics as he is to modernize its economy and liberalize its culture. Thus, we are fortunate to have a new book on Saudi Arabia as helpful as David H. Rundell’s “Vision or Mirage: Saudi Arabia at the Crossroads.” If you don’t know the author’s name, don’t worry. It’s because he is a longtime American civil servant who lived in Saudi Arabia for 16 of his 30 years with the Foreign Service, and has traveled the length and breadth of the land.
