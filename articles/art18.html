RIGHT NOW N.B.A. players pledged to return to the court, and the N.H.L. called off two days of playoff games. The New York Mets and Miami Marlins chose not to play their scheduled game on Thursday, joining 12 other Major League Baseball teams in sitting out. Before the decision was formalized, Brodie Van Wagenen, the Mets’ general manager, was captured on video delivering a searing critique of Commissioner Rob Manfred that he later retracted in a written apology. “At the leadership level, he doesn’t get it,” Van Wagenen said of Manfred, in a video feed the Mets use for Zoom news conferences that appeared to have been accidentally broadcast online. Van Wagenen’s comments came as he spoke with two unidentified people who were not visible in the video about a proposal for the Mets and Marlins to stage a walkout at the game’s scheduled start time and to then return to the filed and start play an hour later. Van Wagenen said he thought it was Manfred’s plan, but it had actually come from his boss, Jeff Wilpon, the Mets’ chief operating officer. Van Wagenen said Wilpon had called Manfred to tell him the players had voted not to play, and the two had discussed the difficulty of rescheduling the game, since the teams are not supposed to meet again this season. Wilpon proposed the delayed start, irritating Van Wagenen. “The players had already made their decision so I felt the suggestion was not helpful,” Van Wagenen said in his subsequent statement. “My frustration with the commissioner was wrong and unfounded. I apologize to the commissioner for my disrespectful comments and poor judgment in inaccurately describing the contents of his private conversation with Jeff Wilpon.” In the end, the Mets’ starters took the field at game time as the other players on both teams stood in foul territory for 42 seconds of silence in a nod to Jackie Robinson, who wore No. 42 and broke baseball’s color barrier in 1947. The players then retreated to their clubhouses for the night, leaving a “Black Lives Matter” T-shirt draped across home plate. Residents sat in lawn chairs in driveways and on porches. They watched cars roll up, pause at a stop sign and then drive on. The only reminder that something significant had happened at the quiet corner was a silver sedan parked on the side of the street with its windows busted out. This was the intersection where Jacob Blake, a Black man, had been shot by a white police officer on Sunday, inciting the kind of widespread protests and wanton destruction that a small lakeside community like Kenosha, Wis., had never seen. By Thursday, some of the tension of earlier in the week appeared to be continuing to fade after what had been a relatively quiet Wednesday night. The most disruptive thing in town seemed to be stores closing early because of a 7 p.m. curfew. Many residents tugged on the locked doors of gas stations and pharmacies before walking away in frustration. After the curfew arrived, a small group milled around a town square in front of the county courthouse. Marchers had taken a few laps through the city on Wednesday night, but the scene was calm. Earlier in the week, the square had been the scene of raucous clashes between protesters and the police. By Thursday, the intersection where Mr. Blake was shot was just an intersection again. Local residents said they remained resolute in wanting to continue to push for change, but they also lamented the destruction of some of the city’s businesses. “That’s a different crowd,” Sharice Coleman, 23, a Kenosha native said of those who had rioted. People like her, she said, were in the streets out to advocate for change. Although things might have quieted down on Wednesday and Thursday, there were major rallies planned in Kenosha for Friday and Saturday. The event on Saturday is expected to include Mr. Blake’s family, who say he was left paralyzed by the shooting. Prosecutors on Thursday charged a 17-year-old with killing two protesters and wounding a third in Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday, filing several homicide-related counts against him and laying out what they say happened on the chaotic night of the shootings. The teenager, Kyle H. Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Ill., was accused in a criminal complaint of first-degree intentional homicide in the death of Anthony M. Huber, the most serious of the charges; first-degree reckless homicide in the death of Joseph D. Rosenbaum, and attempted first-degree intentional homicide in the shooting of Gaige P. Grosskreutz. In one of several videos of the shootings that is cited in the complaint, prosecutors said that Mr. Rittenhouse can be heard saying “I just killed somebody” into his cellphone amid the shootings on Tuesday.   Under Wisconsin law, a 17-year-old defendant is charged as an adult. Mr. Rittenhouse faces a potential life sentence if he is convicted of first-degree intentional homicide and up to 60 years in prison if he is found guilty of first-degree reckless homicide, according to the complaint, which was filed in Circuit Court by the Kenosha County district attorney, Michael Gravely. In the narrative laid out in the complaint,  Mr. Rosenbaum, 36, threw a plastic bag at and approached Mr. Rittenhouse, who responded by firing several shots from a Smith & Wesson AR-15-style rifle. The complaint quotes a witness saying that Mr. Rosenbaum, who was fatally wounded, had tried to grab the gun. From there, according to the complaint, a chaotic scene unfolded, with Mr. Rittenhouse running through the Kenosha streets in the middle of the night, chased at time by people who  yelled for someone to stop him as he continued to fire shots before falling to the ground. In the videos, the complaint says, Mr. Huber, a skateboard in his hand, can be seen approaching Mr. Rittenhouse as he lay on the ground. “Huber appears to be trying to pull the gun away from the defendant,” the complaint says. Mr. Rittenhouse rolled away from Mr. Huber and fired one round at him, the complaint says. “Huber staggers away, taking several steps, then collapses to the ground.” A coroner’s examination showed that the bullet penetrated Mr. Huber’s heart, aorta, pulmonary artery and right lung, the complaint says. At that point Mr. Grosskreutz, his hands in the air, approached Mr. Rittenhouse, who was by then sitting up. Mr. Rittenhouse shot Mr. Grosskreutz in the arm, the complaint says. The coroner found that Mr. Rosenbaum was shot several times, including a shot in the back  that perforated his right lung and liver, the complaint says. The N.H.L. and its players’ union agreed on Thursday to postpone playoff games scheduled for Thursday and Friday, to protest the shooting of a Back man by a white police officer in Kenosha, Wis. The move came as the N.B.A. extended its shutdown, which began on Wednesday when a walkout by Milwaukee Bucks players quickly spread to other teams and other major sports, to a second day. N.B.A. players have pledged in talks with team owners to resume the season, according to two people who were part of the discussions and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the negotiations were still underway. When teams might return to the court and how the missed games might be rescheduled remained unclear. “We are hopeful to resume games either Friday or Saturday,” Mike Bass, the league’s executive vice president, said in a statement. The N.B.A. has a large proportion of Black players, some of whom are known for speaking out on systemic racism, police violence and other social issues. The N.H.L. has few Black players, but the league and the players association, in a joint statement, said they stood in solidarity  with those who have been protesting the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha “Black and brown communities continue to face real, painful experiences,” they said. They added, “We understand that the tragedies involving Jacob Blake, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others require us to recognize this moment.” Athletes from the W.N.B.A., Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the professional tennis tour also sat out games and matches on Wednesday, escalating a season of demonstrations for social justice. The W.N.B.A. postponed three games scheduled for Thursday evening as players “continue discussions and reflections on recent events,” the league said in a statement. It was not clear when the games would be played. In the tennis world, matches at the Western & Southern Open, which is being played in New York, were suspended on Thursday, organizers said, with matches for men and women set to resume on Friday. Naomi Osaka, the winner of two Grand Slam titles, said on Wednesday that she would sit out the tournament’s semifinals to protest racial injustice. But on Thursday she had decided to participate after tennis officials agreed to move the matches to Friday. “They offered to postpone all matches until Friday, and in my mind that brings more attention to the movement,” Osaka said, adding that she was, and remained, prepared to concede her match to Elise Mertens.  Anthony Huber, one of men who was killed amid the protests in Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday was friendly with Jacob Blake, a member of the dead man’s family said. Susan Hughes, Mr. Huber’s great-aunt, said he had been drawn to the protests because he knew Mr. Blake. Mr. Huber, an avid skateboarder, rode his board to the protest on Tuesday, distressed both by what had happened to Mr. Blake, and by the way he was being disparaged online. Mr. Blake, who is Black, is paralyzed, according to family members. The officer who shot him, identified as Rusten Sheskey, is white, as was Mr. Huber, 26. Kyle Rittenhouse, who has been charged with fatally shooting Mr. Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum, is a white 17-year-old who drove to Kenosha from Illinois armed with an AR-15-style rifle. Ms. Hughes described Mr. Huber as an intellectually curious man who enjoyed reading about philosophy and Buddhism. Mr. Huber was open about having bipolar disorder Ms. Hughes said, and he had been in and out of jail since he was a teenager, over incidents she attributed to an persistent family dispute. Once, Ms. Hughes said, Mr. Huber convinced a prison library to add a section of graphic novels, supplying the librarian with a list of titles to get started. “It’s just such a waste,” Ms. Hughes said. “He was always one of the smartest people in the room.” Things had been looking up for Mr. Huber, Ms. Hughes said: He was working temp jobs several days a week and he had a girlfriend. Last week, he passed his driving test and received a driver’s license for the first time. His birthday was on Friday. His girlfriend, Hannah Gittings, described Mr. Huber as “amazing” in an emotional speech  to demonstrators who gathered near where he was shot on Wednesday. The other shooting victim, Mr. Rosenbaum, was originally from Waco, Texas, and had a 2-year-old daughter, his sister told The Chicago Sun-Times. Efforts to reach his family on Thursday were not successful. Hours before three protesters were shot in Kenosha, Wis., late Tuesday, calls went out on social media for armed vigilantes to flock to the city and to use force against demonstrators who were described as thugs and arsonists, according to a group that monitors internet disinformation. “The seeds of potential violence were planted over the course of the day,” the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab said in a blog post on Wednesday, “as multiple threads on Facebook and Reddit encouraged militiamen and other armed individuals to head to Kenosha, ostensibly to protect local businesses from protesters.” The group added: “In some cases, these discussions encouraged acts of violence. The conspiracy website InfoWars, meanwhile, amplified the call to arms, potentially encouraging additional people with weapons to attend the event.” A 17-year-old, Kyle Rittenhouse, has been charged in the shootings, two of which were fatal. In an interview on Tuesday night before the shootings, Mr. Rittenhouse told a video editor at The Daily Caller, a conservative news and opinion site, that he and other armed people were present because protecting businesses was “our job.” On the day of the shooting, the Atlantic Council researchers found, a Facebook page was created, calling for people to “gear up” and protect Kenosha. One person posted on the page, which has since been deleted, “shoot to kill.” Another now-deleted Facebook page, claiming to represent a local militia group, asked people to “take up arms” and to defend Kenosha from “evil thugs” who were “planning on the next part of the City to burn.” The message was promoted by Infowars, and then repeated on hundreds of other Facebook pages. One person who posted in a Reddit discussion thread wrote that 75 people were on their way to Kenosha from Green Bay, Wis., adding: “We have lots of guns. Lots of pipe bombs.” Another Reddit commenter demanded that “all nonwhites and degenerates leave Kenosha.” Facebook has removed Mr. Rittenhouse’s accounts on that network and Instagram, removed praise for him on other accounts and blocked searches for his name, said Brian Fishman, the company’s director of Counterterrorism and Dangerous Organizations. In a Twitter thread, Mr. Fishman said that Facebook had also removed the account of the militia group for violating the company’s rules, but that it had found no evidence Mr. Rittenhouse had seen the group’s posts.
