A decision on whether to charge the officers involved may come soon. By Richard A. Oppel Jr., Derrick Bryson Taylor and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs The Louisville Metro Police Department is preparing for a possible announcement this week about whether criminal charges will be brought against the white officers who shot and killed Breonna Taylor, a Black medical worker whose death in March was one of several police killings that drove demonstrations across the country this summer. It is unclear if an announcement from the Kentucky attorney general, Daniel Cameron, who is investigating the case, will come this week, but Robert Schroeder, the city’s interim police chief, indicated on Tuesday that “rumors” made him believe that it might. He said the police were placing barricades around downtown this week to reduce access to the area in case the announcement prompts protests. Mr. Schroeder also told police officers that he would not approve any requests for time off. “In the community, we have all heard the rumors,” Chief Schroeder said at a news conference on Tuesday. “We all know something is coming. We don’t know what it is.” Mayor Greg Fischer, a Democrat, also issued a state of emergency on Tuesday in anticipation of possible “civil unrest” following Mr. Cameron’s announcement, although Mr. Fischer said that he also did not know when it would come. Mr. Cameron, a Republican, said last month that he had received a ballistics report and called it a “critical piece” of the investigation, but he declined to share its findings and has said little about his inquiry, which began in the spring. The Police Department was also grappling with an email sent to officers on Tuesday morning by a sergeant who fired his gun — and was shot — during the raid of Ms. Taylor’s apartment. “I know we did the legal, moral and ethical thing that night,” Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, who is on administrative leave, wrote in the email, which he sent to fellow officers at 2:06 a.m. and which was later posted online by a Vice News correspondent. Kent Wicker, a lawyer for Sergeant Mattingly, confirmed the email was genuine. During the raid, Sergeant Mattingly was shot once in the leg by Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend as the sergeant entered the apartment. He later said in a statement to investigators that he had fired off at least six rounds in response. In the email to his colleagues, Sergeant Mattingly railed against the Police Department’s command staff, the mayor and the F.B.I. and said “good guys are demonized, and criminals are canonized.” Since the recent national demonstrations over police brutality and systemic racism that began in late May, Louisville officials have banned the use of no-knock warrants, which allow the police to forcibly enter people’s homes to search them without warning, and, in late June, fired one of the officers involved in the shooting. For months, Ms. Taylor’s family has pleaded for justice, pushing for criminal charges against the officers. Ms. Taylor’s case began to draw national attention in May, and she has since been the center of campaigns from several celebrities and athletes, some of whom have dedicated their seasons to keeping a spotlight on her case. In September, Louisville officials agreed to pay $12 million to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by Ms. Taylor’s mother and to institute reforms aimed at preventing future deaths by officers. Still, critics say progress in the case has been slow, especially when compared with the Floyd case, where officers were swiftly fired and charged. “At this point it’s bigger than Breonna, it’s bigger than just Black Lives,” Ms. Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, said over the summer as she beseeched the authorities to bring criminal charges. “We’ve got to figure out how to fix the city, how to heal from here.”
