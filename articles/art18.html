She has been working inside the bubble for nearly two months, focused on the Philadelphia 76ers, who made the playoffs and extended her stay there. But she has still made time for her patients back home in New York City, guiding them through one-on-one virtual sessions to provide relief to their aching joints with techniques usually rendered by her well-trained hands. “I’ve fixed people’s backs remotely,” she said. “Through observation and how they move and function, I am able to reverse the cycle of the pain.” Dr. Caspare has also been a beneficiary of this type of virtual medicine herself, including a virtual dental visit during which she participated in cleaning her own teeth. Concierge care, which offers personalized medical services for people who can afford it, has grown fast in the pandemic as patients seek direct access to physicians. Basic telemedicine can bring with it cumbersome insurance protocols and hard-to-navigate health care portals. Concierge care, which is typically not covered by insurance, gets around restrictions placed on doctors and other health care providers. But it comes at a steep cost: Prices for services can be two to three times higher, and that comes on top of annual fees. When more than 173,000 people in the United States have died from the coronavirus and millions of Americans remain out of work, the growing interest in concierge medical services may seem out of touch with the devastation the pandemic has inflicted. But the concept is expanding in other areas. The affluent are able to pay a premium for a luxury pursuit that was relatively affordable before the coronavirus crisis, like pampering themselves with a private manicure or hiring a personal trainer for a home workout. Doctors say they have had to expand their services or create new ones to meet the expectations of their wealthy patients. “This stuff always starts at the top of the market because insurance companies are not paying for this,” said Dr. Yves Duroseau, an emergency room physician and adviser to OpenClear, which has offered about 600 in-home coronavirus screenings in Miami and the New York area since March. OpenClear’s in-home tests cost as much as $1,000 and deliver results within 12 hours. There’s an additional $1,000 fee for a medical professional to travel to the Hamptons to perform a test. For now, though, with single services that cost thousands of dollars, on top of five-figure annual concierge fees, this niche is the province of wealthy patients. Dentists were hit particularly hard when the pandemic shuttered businesses, and many have continued to suffer because patients are returning slowly for routine care. One Manhattan Dental, which began last year as a concierge practice that does not accept insurance, had to alter its offerings to stay relevant for its clients. Dr. Robert Raimondi, a co-founder of the practice, said the office had no telemedicine offering when the pandemic hit, because dental work usually requires a physical examination. Within a few weeks, the practice began offering virtual hygiene checks. Dr. Raimondi said it had started providing dental boxes with electric toothbrushes, different types of floss and toothpaste, tongue scrapes and mouthwash.
