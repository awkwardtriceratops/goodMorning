By John Otis The first time William McCollum was released from prison, his mother pleaded with him to stop selling drugs. But Mr. McCollum, who had had previous run-ins with the police, made no such promises. “Nobody’s going to help me,” Mr. McCollum recalled thinking those decades ago. “I screwed my life up so now I have to do what I have to do.” Donate now to the 109th annual campaign of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. All proceeds go to 10 organizations providing assistance to those facing economic hardship. Make a tax-deductible donation through GoFundMe. On July 20, 2000, Mr. McCollum was arrested again in South Carolina and charged with a Class A felony: possession with intent to sell and distribute crack cocaine. The crime carried a 30-year prison sentence. Early into his incarceration, after being transferred to Otisville Correctional Facility, Mr. McCollum encountered a drug kingpin whom he had idolized. He made an effusive introduction, only to be admonished for glamorizing the lifestyle that had led to their confinement. Shaken, Mr. McCollum began attending a self-improvement program for inmates. “It changed my whole mind-set,” Mr. McCollum, 55, said in a recent interview. “It helped me realize all my mistakes and accept my own faults.” Before long, he was facilitating several programs that covered subjects including anger management, parenting and public speaking. After his 2002 conviction, Mr. McCollum spent 17 years, 6 months and 13 days in prison. When he was released in the summer of 2019, he did not want to squander his freedom. He knew his criminal record would be a hindrance to finding lucrative work. “A person like me, who would love to work a decent job, will never have the chance because of my criminal history,” Mr. McCollum said. “I can’t blame anybody but myself.” But a career helping others seemed fitting after his experiences in prison, as well as achievable, so in March, he signed up to begin training to become a substance abuse counselor. At the same time, he was living with his mother in Corona, Queens; making plans to marry his fiancée, who had waited for him for 18 years; and waiting for the training program to begin. Then the Covid-19 lockdown struck New York. The abrupt halt in his progress was a nasty sting. New York City’s economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, with the unemployment rate around 20 percent. Mr. McCollum, who receives $165 in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, had done odd jobs to get by.
