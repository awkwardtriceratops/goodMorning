By Joel Santo Domingo Mr. Santo Domingo is a senior staff writer at Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times Company. For anyone used to working in a traditional office, working from home has revealed just how telecommuting-unfriendly a living space can be. While it may be uncomfortable to sit in a bad office chair or type under dim overhead lighting, a bad internet connection can really impede your productivity — or even grind it to a halt. Between Zoom meetings and remote learning, coupled with more members of the household hogging up bandwidth, you might have noticed a slower-than-usual connection. As a senior writer at Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, who specializes in network devices, even I have had to contend with adequate, but not great, Wi-Fi connections. Common causes for a crawling Wi-Fi connection include using the subpar router rented (for a fee!) from an internet service provider; a home with rooms far from a router; or a router that requires an extra boost to reach a corner of the home office, backyard patio or the surveillance camera over the garage door. While every scenario is different, the symptoms are the same. Smart speakers disconnect from the internet, kids will gripe about buffering when swiping to the 15th TikTok in a row, or you may experience choppy audio and video on a work call (the worst sin of all). Here are five things to help speed up the Wi-Fi connections on all your devices, based on my years of testing routers and wireless networks at Wirecutter. Wi-Fi signals tend to be stronger horizontally from the router, and when the router is on the same floor of a home as the devices connected to it. If possible, try to move the router (while still connected to your modem) to a more central location in your home, like right off the main hallway. If that’s not possible, at the very least try to place the router as high as you can, as long as the cables can reach. Placing the router on a high bookshelf is much better than hiding it in a cabinet near the floor. Fewer obstructions (like masonry or walls) between the router and the antennas inside your laptop will improve your experience. With all the advancements in wireless technology, it’s counterintuitive to go back to a wired connection, but connecting your laptop directly to the router with an Ethernet cable improves things two ways: Wired connections in your home are always faster and more reliable than wireless. You’re also taking your laptop off the Wi-Fi, freeing up the signal for other devices that can’t plug in, like your smart speakers in the den or your kids’ iPads in the living room. Some homes built in the last 10 to 15 years are pre-wired with Ethernet. Look for an RJ45 Ethernet jack next to the cable TV connector or phone jack on the wall in each room. You can identify RJ45 fairly easily, as it is about twice as wide as the RJ11 phone jack. If you’re lucky enough to have this installed, a connection through this wired network is the best way to get your laptop or desktop PC on the internet. Most business laptops have an Ethernet connector built in, if not, you can purchase a USB-to-Ethernet adapter for about $20. Sometimes your problem isn’t generally slow internet, but a weak signal in one part of the house. If you have a dead zone, an inexpensive Wi-Fi extender can help improve Wi-Fi signals, whether around an obstacle like a fireplace and chimney in the center of a home or a far-off guest bedroom. They’re a cheap solution because they simply repeat the signals up to your router, but note that extenders can often slow down overall performance because of that hop. They make the most sense for an isolated trouble spot. If, however, you have several problem rooms or areas in your home, consider a new router or a mesh networking kit.
