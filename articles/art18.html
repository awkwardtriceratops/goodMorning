Williams, who will testify before lawmakers on Thursday, told Congress he had suggested his fellow governors investigate the new postmaster general’s background ahead of his hiring. By Nicholas Fandos WASHINGTON — David C. Williams, the former vice chairman of the U.S. Postal Service’s board of governors, told lawmakers on Thursday that he had raised concerns months ago about the possible selection of Louis DeJoy as postmaster general and had suggested fellow board members investigate the executive’s background. As the board moved to hire Mr. DeJoy, a major donor to President Trump and other Republicans, to lead the multibillion-dollar agency this spring, Mr. Williams resigned in protest, citing his concerns about Mr. DeJoy as one reason. “I had expressed concerns after each of the interviews with Mr. Louis DeJoy,” Mr. Williams told two House Democratic lawmakers in a statement. “I urged that a background investigation be conducted. And when I resigned, I cited it as one of my reasons for submitting my resignation to Chairman Robert Duncan.” The statement was disclosed on Thursday afternoon in a letter from Representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois and Katie Porter of California, both Democrats, to John M. Barger, another Postal Service governor who spearheaded the search for the new postmaster general. Its release came just an hour before Mr. Williams was scheduled to testify before the Congressional Progressive Caucus about Mr. DeJoy and broader concerns that one of the country’s oldest, largest and most highly rated government entities was being politicized by the Trump administration. The lawmakers approached Mr. Williams to respond to comments Mr. Barger made to The New York Times on Wednesday. Mr. Barger said that he had “never heard an objection from David Williams about any of the candidates, other than the ones we did not hire” and that he was “surprised” by Mr. Williams’s resignation in late April, shortly before the board unanimously ratified the selection of Mr. DeJoy and announced it publicly. “I don’t recall him ever having objected to anything,” Mr. Barger told The Times, “or I would have asked him why. And it would have been considered.” Mr. DeJoy, a former transportation and logistics executive, began the job in June and has quickly come under intense scrutiny for his continuing financial ties to his previous employer, which does business with the Postal Service, as well as cost-cutting initiatives that have slowed mail delivery. Lawmakers of both parties, along with civil rights groups and state attorneys general, have raised concerns about the operational changes given the growing likelihood that many Americans will need to vote by mail this November because of the coronavirus pandemic. At a time when Mr. Trump is attacking mail-in voting, voting rights advocates fear that the slowdown in service could intentionally or incidentally undermine the integrity of the vote. Mr. DeJoy said on Tuesday that he would suspend some of the changes, but he has not committed to Democrats’ demands that he reverse some that are already in place, like the removal of hundreds of mail-sorting machines. Democrats are now trying to use Congress’s power to force him to do so and infuse $25 billion in emergency funding into the beleaguered agency, which has been rattled by the pandemic. Mr. Williams, one of the Republican-controlled board’s designated Democratic members, had served for 13 years as the Postal Service’s inspector general. A former Army intelligence officer, he had worked in similar watchdog roles at a handful of other agencies before that. Updated August 17, 2020 Mr. Williams has not spoken publicly since he left the board of governors, but people familiar with his thinking have said he had grown increasingly alarmed about the politicization of the Postal Service and specifically the influence of the Treasury Department. Under Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a department task force has pushed for substantial cost-cutting changes at the Postal Service, which union leaders, Democrats and others contend are really an attempt to sabotage the agency to benefit private competitors. In their letter, Mr. Krishnamoorthi and Ms. Porter asked Mr. Barger, who has also donated to Republicans, to detail “any possible coordination you may have had with political entities when recommending Mr. Louis DeJoy to the selection committee.” The board of governors retained an outside firm, Russell Reynolds Associates, to help facilitate the search. But the lawmakers cite multiple unnamed people involved in the search saying that it was Mr. Barger, not the firm, who had injected Mr. DeJoy’s name into the process. In the interview with The Times, Mr. Barger said that the candidates were vigorously vetted and that Mr. DeJoy’s selection had been unanimous. Mr. DeJoy will testify before a Senate panel for the first time on Friday and before a House panel on Monday.
