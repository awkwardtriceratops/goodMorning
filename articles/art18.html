By Charlie Savage WASHINGTON — A Federal District Court judge may go forward with his plans to scrutinize the Justice Department’s request to drop the prosecution of President Trump’s former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn, a full appeals court ruled on Monday. A three-judge panel on the court had earlier ordered the judge to end the case immediately. Separately, a panel on that same court ruled for a second time that the House cannot sue Donald F. McGahn II, the president’s former White House counsel, for defying a subpoena. The full court already reversed one such ruling by that same panel on different grounds, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would “immediately” ask the full body for another do-over. “If allowed to stand, this wrongheaded court of appeals panel ruling threatens to strike a grave blow to one of the most fundamental constitutional roles of the Congress: to conduct oversight on behalf of the American people, including by issuing our lawful and legitimate subpoenas,” she said, calling the ruling “a flawed judicial attack on the entire House.” Both cases arose from the Trump-Russia investigation, involve separation-of-powers issues and put on display a partisan divide on the appeals court: Each was randomly assigned to a three-judge panel that had two Republican appointees, even though Democratic appointees are a majority. The full court can vacate panel rulings it disagrees with and rehear the matter. And in each, Judge Thomas Griffith, a George W. Bush appointee who is stepping down from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit after Monday, played a key role. In a concurring opinion in the Flynn matter, he urged people to interpret the outcome as being about the law, not “the partisan skirmishes of the day.” Mr. Flynn had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with a Russian ambassador in December 2016. But the Justice Department, in a surprise move in May, moved to drop the case. The case has since been enveloped in a fight over whether the trial judge, Emmet G. Sullivan, must dismiss the case since the Justice Department no longer wants to pursue it, or if he may scrutinize whether Attorney General William P. Barr sought to drop it for illegitimate reasons. Judge Sullivan could reject the department’s request to end the case and instead sentence Mr. Flynn anyway. In July, a three-judge panel voted, 2 to 1, to order Judge Sullivan to dismiss the case without completing his review. The two judges in the majority were Neomi Rao, an appointee of Mr. Trump, and Karen L. Henderson, an appointee of the first President George Bush. The decision to instead let Judge Sullivan hold a hearing before ruling on the request to drop the case had been expected since the full court voted to erase the panel decision and rehear it. The main decision was unsigned, but it appeared likely that the judges voted 8 to 2; only Judges Rao and Henderson signed dissents. (An 11th judge on the court, Gregory Katsas — who, like Judge Rao, used to work for the Trump White House — recused himself.)
