TRANSCRIPT “Hey, everybody, it’s me, Kamala.” “Tonight we are going to hear from so many phenomenal women who are working to help us build that more perfect union.” “Tonight I’m thinking of the girls and boys who see themselves in America’s future because of Kamala Harris — a black woman, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, and our nominee for vice president. This is our country’s story: breaking down barriers and expanding the circle of possibility.” ♫ “I’m in love with my future, and you don’t know ...” ♫ “Donald Trump’s ignorance and incompetence have always been a danger to our country. Covid-19 was Trump’s biggest test. He failed miserably. Today America has the most Covid deaths in the world and an economic collapse.” “My mom worked hard and paid taxes, and the Obama administration told her she could stay. My dad thought you would protect military families. So he voted for you in 2016, Mr. President. He says he won’t vote for you again after what you did to our family.” “The wife of a U.S. Marine veteran was deported to Mexico.” “Instead of protecting us, you tore our world apart.” “My mom is a good person, and she’s not a criminal.” “Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job, because he can’t. And the consequences of that failure are severe: 170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone, while those at the top take in more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before. But more than anything, what I know about Joe, what I know about Kamala, is that they actually care about every American, and that they care deeply about this democracy. They believe that in a democracy, the right to vote is sacred, and we should be making it easier for people to cast their ballots, not harder. They understand that in this democracy, the commander in chief does not use the men and women of our military, who are willing to risk everything to protect our nation, as political props to deploy against peaceful protesters on our own soil. This president and those in power, those who benefit from keeping things the way they are, they are counting on your cynicism. They know they can’t win you over with their policies. So they’re hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote does not matter.” “With only one nomination received and pursuant to our rules, I hereby declare that Kamala Harris is elected as the Democratic candidate for vice president.” “She is the first black woman, first South Asian woman to be named on the Democratic ticket.” “This is a historic pick.” “Someone who looks like us on a presidential ticket, that’s crazy.” “That I am here tonight is a testament to the dedication of generations before me: women and men who believed so fiercely in the promise of equality, liberty and justice for all. This week marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment. And we celebrate the women who fought for that right. Yet so many of the Black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting long after its ratification. But they were undeterred. Without fanfare or recognition, they organized and testified and rallied and marched and fought, not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table. My mother taught me that service to others gives life purpose and meaning. And oh, how I wish she were here tonight, but I know she’s looking down on me from above. I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman, all of five feet tall, who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, Calif. On that day she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now and speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America. Make no mistake: The road ahead is not easy. We may stumble. We may fall short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly and deal with our challenges honestly. We will speak truths, and we will act with the same faith in you that we ask you to place in us. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.” [music and applause] By Shane Goldmacher and Jonathan Martin Shane: Three nights down, and many of the Democratic Party’s biggest stars have spoken. The Obamas and the Clintons. Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s leading rivals from the 2020 primaries. And delivering the biggest speech of her career: Senator Kamala Harris. What do you think the big takeaway was from Wednesday night? Jonathan: There was Barack Obama and then there was everything else. I don’t think much of anything else will be remembered tomorrow, at least in terms of rhetoric. A former president not only blistering his successor but standing at the birthplace of American democracy to essentially say: break glass, this is a (political) emergency. Shane: It was a tough draw for Ms. Harris to follow Mr. Obama, for sure. But I do think she delivered a speech — even with the extra challenge of no cheering crowd — that both helped introduce herself to the country and flashed the cutting one-liners that Democrats fell in love with from her congressional inquisitions. “There is no vaccine for racism” chief among them. Jonathan: Yeah, she did what she needed to do, introduced herself to medium-info voters just tuning in, praised Mr. Biden and took after President Trump. Mission accomplished. But as with most V.P. speeches, I’m not sure any lines will be remembered. Shane: One small thing that struck me — from Ms. Harris, Mr. Obama, Hillary Clinton and lots of others — was the repeated focus on the mechanics of voting. Democrats really want people getting mail-in ballots, and getting them in early. Jonathan: Even repeating the number to text! Really added to the infomercial vibe of the whole affair. Operators are standing by … Shane: Look, the fact that the Biden campaign got to play — uninterrupted in prime time — the 2017 Medal of Freedom ceremony was a political gift as valuable as any infomercial. It will be interesting to see how the Trump campaign tries to leverage this kind of access to the airwaves, and what the networks do and don’t air next week. Anyway, after 75 percent of the convention, it really feels like, if the Biden team hopes voters take away one word from this week, it would be “empathy.” TRANSCRIPT Trump came in with so much set up for him: a strong economy, plans for managing crises including a pandemic. Yes, we Democrats would have disagreed with him on many things. But if he had put his own interests and ego aside, seen the humanity in a child ripped from her parents at the border, or a protester calling for justice, or a family wiped out by natural disaster, that would have been a good thing for America and the world. For four years, people have told me: “I didn’t realize how dangerous he was. I wish I could do it all over.” Or worst, “I should have voted.” Look, this can’t be another woulda, coulda, shoulda election. If you vote by mail, request your ballot now and send it back right away. If you vote in person, do it early. Become a poll worker. Most of all, no matter what, vote. As Michelle Obama and Bernie Sanders warned us, if Trump is re-elected, things will get even worse. Vote for honest elections — so we, not a foreign adversary, choose our president. Vote for the diverse, hopeful America we saw in last night’s roll call. And don’t forget: Joe and Kamala can win by 3 million votes and still lose. Take it from me. Jonathan: It was a workmanlike effort from the Democrats’ 2016 nominee, and one that often evoked, well, 2016. She alluded to knowing from “slings and arrows,” she did an even-Bernie-Sanders shout-out, she referred to “foreign adversaries,” and she made sure to note that she won the popular vote. I think that’s to be expected. It’s forever 2016 for many Democrats, not just the Clintons. Shane: Hmmm, I seem to recall a really good column on that. Jonathan: Appreciate you! Which reminds me, have you considered the Democrats’ anxiety — and flare-up of 2016 PTSD — if and when Mr. Trump narrows the gap in the polls? Shane: It’s really going to be something — or imagine a first-debate flop like Mr. Obama’s in 2012. But back to this week, seeing Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton — the stars of so many conventions past — out of the prime-time spotlight is still something to get used to. And it’s not like Mr. Biden was all about turning the page on the past with the whole program. Jonathan: Right. But the polling is clear: This is Mr. Obama’s party. That’s no small part of why the Democrats nominated … Joe Biden this year! Shane: Remember all those Mike Bloomberg ads, trying to make him appear as the Obama candidate? Jonathan: Yeah, we saw a lot of file footage this past primary season from the 2009-2017 White House. TRANSCRIPT Out of pain, we choose to find meaning, a glimmer of light that lands on a promise. Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, shot in the head from less than three feet away, but she survived. When tragedy strikes, we seek comfort in knowing we aren’t alone. “Join us in this fight.” We seek strength to keep fighting, to keep moving forward. We turn to leaders who share our pain. Joe Biden: “In the most difficult times is when we stand closest together. It’s out of tragedy that we grow stronger.” “He was there for me. He’ll be there for you, too.” We are a nation ready to end gun violence. A safer America is possible, but from this point forward, we must choose courage. “I’ve known the darkest of days, days of pain and uncertain recovery, but confronted by despair, I’ve summoned hope. Confronted by paralysis and aphasia, I responded with grit and determination. I put one foot in front of the other. I found one word and then I found another. My recovery is a daily fight. But fighting makes me stronger. Words once came easily. Today I struggle to speak. But I have not lost my voice. America needs all of us to speak out, even when you have to fight to find the words. We are at a crossroads. We can let the shooting continue or we can act. We can protect our families, our future. We can vote. We can be on the right side of history. We must elect Joe Biden. He was there for me. He will be there for you, too. Join us in this fight. Vote, vote, vote. Thank you very much.” Shane: This happens every convention (even non-virtual ones!), but the divide between what makes it into prime time and what doesn’t is very revealing. I actually thought one of the most powerful moments from Wednesday’s lineup was former Representative Gabby Giffords. Less than a decade after she was shot in the head at point-blank range, there she is playing the French horn and delivering a searing speech about gun violence. Jonathan: It may prove to be the most emotional moment of the week. And, incidentally, I can still remember where I was when I heard Ms. Giffords was shot. There’s something profound that still lingers about her attempted assassination — and her extraordinary recovery. Shane: I was in the gallery when she made her return to the House floor, and the progress she has made since then is simply inspiring. She anchored a 9 p.m. hour that was really our first foray into policy: guns, climate change and immigration. Jonathan: Much, much more substantive than the fare of the first two nights, which was heavy on portraying Mr. Biden as a good man and Mr. Trump as, well, a not-so-good one. Shane: And it felt very much geared toward younger voters (see: Billie Eilish). But I wonder if we were looking at Mr. Biden’s political imperatives or his 2021 governing priorities. Mr. Biden has plenty of policy plans, but they have never been his emphasis. I know we both saw him apologize plenty of times during the primary for even veering into policy on the stump. Jonathan: I think after all the older figures of the first two nights, Republicans and Democrats, and the short shrift given to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, that younger and more progressive voters needed something that spoke more to them. TRANSCRIPT Tonight I want to talk as plainly as I can about the stakes in this election — because what we do these next 76 days will echo through generations to come. I have sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president. I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope for the sake of our country that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously, that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care. But he never did. For close to four years now, he has shown no interest in putting in the work, no interest in finding common ground, no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends, no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves. Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job, because he can’t. And the consequences of that failure are severe. This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down, if that’s what it takes for them to win. So we have to get busy building it up — by pouring all our efforts into these 76 days and by voting like never before: for Joe and Kamala and candidates up and down the ticket, so that we leave no doubt about what this country that we love stands for. Shane: OK, you’re a history buff. Has a former president ever spoken like Mr. Obama did about a current one? Jonathan: Well, not in modern times. When Theodore Roosevelt tried to come back in 1912, he was tough on William Howard Taft. He called the portly incumbent a “fathead.” But Mr. Obama tonight said Mr. Trump was a menace to democracy and ridiculed him as lazy, saying he had “no interest in putting in the work.” Shane: But other than that … Jonathan: Oh, hat tip to David Greenberg, an excellent historian with a forthcoming John Lewis biography, who exhumed our paper’s coverage of Herbert Hoover’s scathing attack on Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936. Shane: The whole thing was a far cry from the speech that launched Mr. Obama’s career, the keynote at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. You know, the one dismissing how “the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states.” Now Mr. Obama basically builds in the fact that broad swaths of the country are going to tune him out. As he said on Wednesday, “I know that in times as polarized as these, most of you have already made up your mind.” Jonathan: Right, a much more sobered and less optimistic Barack Obama in Philadelphia than he was when he made his national debut in another historic city 16 years ago! Shane: One other thing. The irony is not lost on me that a lot of the response to Mr. Obama’s speech was — gasp — that he broke the norm of not attacking a successor by name. I mean, Mr. Trump has been proudly trampling on norms for four years. All told, do you think Mr. Obama helped Mr. Biden tonight? Jonathan: I think so, for the simple reason that he’s a broadly popular former president who criticized his successor in a way that will echo on social media and in news coverage. And that small but crucial bloc of undecided voters is likely to catch at least a glimpse of his remarks. TRANSCRIPT I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America. Joe and I believe that we can build that beloved community, one that is strong and decent, just and kind, one in which we can all see ourselves. That’s the vision that our parents and grandparents fought for, the vision that made my own life possible, the vision that makes the American promise, for all its complexities and imperfections, a promise worth fighting for. So make no mistake: The road ahead is not easy. We may stumble. We may fall short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly and deal with our challenges honestly. In this election, we have a chance to change the course of history. We’re all in this fight: you, me and Joe, together. What an awesome responsibility. What an awesome privilege. So let’s fight with conviction. Let’s fight with hope. Let’s fight with confidence in ourselves and a commitment to each other, to the America we know is possible. Shane: Well, you said before that none of Ms. Harris’s particular lines are going to stand the test of time. But one of the most powerful messages that Ms. Harris delivers is simply being who she is: the first Black woman and first woman of Asian heritage ever to be on a major-party ticket. Jonathan: An electric moment, particularly for Black women, who are some of the most reliable Democratic voters but have been underrepresented at the top rungs of electoral politics. Nobody knows this better than you, being a son of the Bay Area, but Ms. Harris is always more effective when she’s prepared for a speech or a hearing. She was tonight. It’s just that she happened to speak after the last president called the current president a threat to democracy. Shane: Well, and I wish I could take credit for this idea, but as Heidi Heitkamp pointed out, no one is better at delivering an impassioned speech to an empty room than a United States senator. That hanging silence in the room as Ms. Harris waved to a screen of beamed-in supporters really was an image befitting our socially distanced times. Jonathan: Yes! There have been few things stranger about this week than those first seconds after the speakers conclude when there’s only … silence. Call me old-fashioned, but I miss the real McCoy. The audience reaction can’t be replicated. And, yeah, I miss seeing friends and sources, and pushing our expense account. Shane: So. Do. I. (Especially when it’s on your card.)
