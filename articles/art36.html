By Grant Clauser Mr. Clauser is a senior editor at Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times Company. “Smart home” means different things to different people. For some, it’s the convenience of an internet-connected thermostat or the light bulb they control with a smartphone. For others, it’s a life-changing series of integrated systems, complex programming and automation routines that operate with little user intervention. And for others still, it can mean everything in between. The reality is that smart home devices can be any or all of the above. As a senior editor at Wirecutter, the New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, I’ve been writing about smart home since 1999, back when it was called “home automation.” Today, what we call smart home consists of an array of D.I.Y. devices connected to your smartphone and the internet that allow you to perform tasks and solve problems a little more easily than you did without them. Sure, you know that a smart device can allow you to turn on a light with your voice — but it can also do so much more with just a little bit of homework. Smart home technology, in various forms, has been around for decades. One of the earliest home automation standards, X10, was developed in the 1970s. For a long time, the conveniences of the connected home were relegated to expensive, professionally installed systems, but in the last several years, the do-it-yourself class of smart home devices has flourished and been made popular by companies such as Google, Hue, Amazon and Apple. If it seems to you as if everything is getting smart, you’re not wrong. While home lighting and security have long been the most common categories for smart home, now refrigerators, washing machines, window shades and air-conditioners are all getting integrated Wi-Fi and smart features. You may groan about it now, but like the move to smart TVs, all appliances will eventually be smart ones. If you’re new to smart home devices, but curious enough to give something a try, the landscape may seem a little intimidating. But it doesn’t have to be. The term just refers to the category of devices that can be controlled remotely, via your smartphone or a voice control assistant (think Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri or Google Assistant), or that can be programmed to operate automatically. Most smart home devices are wireless, and while many communicate over Wi-Fi, some use other types of wireless signal like Zigbee, Z-Wave or Bluetooth (the same Bluetooth used by your wireless headphones). No matter how they communicate, their set up and use is mostly plug-and-play. If you know your home’s Wi-Fi password and know how to download an app, you can figure out a new smart home device. The point of all that wireless communication and automatic operation is to simplify common daily tasks. Do you always turn your kitchen lights on at 7 a.m. and off at 9 a.m.? Smart bulbs can do that for you. Do you forget to adjust your thermostat when you leave the house? A smart thermostat can do that, and save you money. Do you want to automatically lock the front door when you go to bed each night? A smart lock will secure your home for you. While you can plan out a whole-home smart system, most people begin with one device and see where that takes them. For instance, if you want to monitor your porch for deliveries, you can get a smart doorbell camera that will send alerts whenever someone comes to the door. If you want to better regulate your home heating and cooling, install a smart thermostat. As you get accustomed to the convenience of these devices, it’s easy to add others that work with them. Not long ago, someone building a whole-house smart home system would start with a hub (a device that acts like a crossing guard for all your accessories). But now cloud-based platforms (servers and software that live in the internet) like Apple HomeKit are taking over. In fact, smart speakers like Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Nest Hub use their own cloud platforms and are largely compatible with devices from most manufacturers. That makes sticking to a single brand or system much less important than it used to be, and it makes picking the devices you like much easier. Having singular smart devices rather than one smart suite from the same brand has become increasingly common and convenient. It’s relatively easy to add to your smart device collection without worrying about them not working together. A collection of smart devices becomes a smart home when you make them work together. Thanks to cloud-based platforms like HomeKit, Alexa and Google Assistant, it’s easier now to get devices in sync than ever before (if you want). Most platforms allow you to create simple automations, often called Routines, in which different devices work together at the same time. For instance, a motion sensor by your front door could not only turn on the light, it might also start your smart speaker playing music and turn on your air-conditioner, all at the same time. You could set up your smart speaker to turn off your bedroom lights, lock your front door and play white noise all by saying “Good night.” The main benefits of smart home devices is making things you do on a daily basis a little easier, and in the case of security-focused devices, making you feel safer. Let’s say you drive to work every day and sometimes forget to close the garage door. A smart garage door controller will send you an alert that the door was left open and then let you close it by tapping an app. If you don’t like coming home to a dark apartment, smart bulbs can automatically turn on based on the time of day, or can be triggered by a small motion sensor when you open the front door. Security devices, like smart cameras, can tell you what’s going on at home when you’re not there. If you have pets, they’re useful for checking in on unauthorized fur friends on the sofa. Smart devices also just remove the friction from doing fun or even mundane things. Color-adjustable lights add to your home’s décor — you can change the color on the fly to suit your mood or activity. Smart speakers allow you to play music easily, and they can also do simple tasks like create a shopping list, call a ride-share car, remind you of an appointment or read your children a bedtime story. The short answer is yes. Any new technology comes with new risks. And as with your smartphone and laptop computer, with a smart home, the risks may come from outside, in the form of hackers, or from inside, in the form of devices with invasive privacy policies, and also from misuse. While documented occurrences of smart home hacking do happen, so far they don’t appear to be common, and there are things you can do to guard against it. First, secure your own home network (which you should do even if you don’t have any smart devices). Use a strong and unique password on your router and enable the strongest encryption your Wi-Fi router offers, probably WPA2. You can also go an extra step by setting up a separate Wi-Fi network for your smart devices. When setting up your devices, Wirecutter prefers products that use two-factor authentication because that offers an extra layer of protection. And just as with your Wi-Fi network, your smart devices need strong, unique passwords rather than the default one your device may come with. It’s not always easy to know what’s going on behind the scenes with smart home products. Some manufacturers encrypt all the data that travels through their products, while others do not. Some track and sell your data to third parties, and others do not. Sometimes you can find this information out in the companies’ privacy policies (always found somewhere in the product app). You don’t have to be a technology hobbyist to enjoy making your home smarter, but you should prepare for some quirks. Tech isn’t always perfect. Sometimes connections fail. Sometimes your smart speaker will mishear you, and sometimes, yes, mistakes will be because of user error. While the options for incorporating smart tech into your life are expanding, it still can’t do everything. You’re still the smartest thing in your home.
