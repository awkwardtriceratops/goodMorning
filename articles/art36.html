In 90 minutes, President Trump made 131 false or inaccurate statements. By Linda Qiu and Michael D. Shear Thank you very — this is great. Hello. How are you? Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. And hello, Janesville and hello, Wisconsin. We love Wisconsin. Look at this crowd. This is massive. But, you know, we're having massive crowds all over the place and I'll tell you what you know, and I look at a poll we're even in Wisconsin. I don't think so. With what I've done for you. USMCA. We got rid of those horrible — you know, you were being charged 287 percent tariff to do business with Canada. I heard about that. I didn't like that. Your specialty milk people got me. Do you believe it? Special — it was all about specialty milk. That was like the straw that broke the camel's back. I said, "What do you mean?" "Yes, sir. They're charging us 287 percent." And I said, "No, they're not any longer." And we knocked the hell out of it, and we got the brand-new USMCA. And sleepy Joe can't do that. It's not in his vocabulary that I — he has no idea what we just said. He's sitting in his basement right now watching us. He has no idea. And I hate to do this to you, I was having a great hair day, and then I heard you had 40 mile an hour winds I'm looking, and I said, all right, give me the cap. I don't do it often, but now I'm looking at that beautiful site. Is that beautiful? Now as beautiful as that is OSHA — as beautiful as that is, I don't know that I'd want to be those people right in that little corner. Look at that. You know, I think it's magnificent, but I'd get out of there. But they have no fear, do you? You have confidence in Trump. Yeah. We get good equipment. Good equipment. It's great to be back in Wisconsin with thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. Thank you very much. It's a great honor. It's a great honor and we're doing great. We're doing really well. I wish you'd have a Republican governor because, frankly, you got to open your state up. You got to open it up. You got to open it up. Get back to school. I'll tell you what, you know, we had a little problem in Florida. We had a surge and then it went away and they opened it. But we had a problem. Big problem in Texas. We had a surge. They opened it up. It's all opened up. Arizona, they had a surge. It's all opened up and our country is opening. And I'll tell you what, when you look at our numbers compared to what's going on in Europe and other places, but we're doing well. We're going to have one of the best economic years we've ever had next year, one of the best we've ever had. With 17 days from now, we're going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win four more years in the White House. And by the way, early voting begins on Tuesday. So get out and vote. Okay? Now, we've had great success in your state, and I've been very good to you likewise with the ships, you build good ships. You know that, right? A lot of other states wanted that contract. I probably lost some states because of it but we gave you the big contract. And honestly, I went to the yards. It's incredible what you do. This is the most important election in the history of our country. And you know, six months ago, I was saying, well, you know, how do you compare with the last one? I don't know. That was important. The fact is this is the single most important election in the history of our country And Sleepy Joe Biden's made a corrupt bargain in exchange — you saw the bargaining made in exchange for his party's nomination, which he shouldn't have gotten because if Pocahontas got out one day early I'd be running against Crazy Bernie, which would have been okay, too. I would have had a small but energized base. Now we have a little bit larger base to run against, but there's zero energy. They're reporting on it. We've got the most energy in the history of politics and he's got the least. The most in the history, and Biden handed control of his party over to hardcore militant left. The Democrat Party you once knew no longer exists. It's now a party of socialists and Marxists and left-wing extremists. If Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists are elected, and I've always said our country will never be a socialist country. They would kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments and you have a lot of great law enforcement people here today. Thank you. Thank you. I think we have every single law enforcement group in the country has endorsed us, even New York City's finest. You know, they endorsed us, first time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate; it's big stuff. Chicago, Florida, Ohio. Everybody's endorsed us, and I said during the debate, I said, "Joe, name one group, law enforcement, that's endorsed you. Name one." And he was starting — he couldn't breathe and then Chris Wallace bailed him out. And I said, "Joe, say the words 'law and order,' say them Joe," and he wouldn't do it. I said, "Say the words, 'law and order,'" then Chris Wallace bailed him out again. But he can't because if he says law and order, that means he loses the radical left. You know which I think he's losing anyway, but they want to dissolve your borders, raise your taxes, destroy your suburbs. Oh, have I saved your suburbs? The women, you know, they keep telling me about suburban women. I think suburban women like me. I've only saved your house and frankly, I've saved your way of life. I've saved the American Dream, but they keep saying Trump has a problem. Well, they — last time they said the same thing. It was even worse. They said I had a problem with women, period. And then the night that beautiful night four years ago — was that the greatest of all time? It was probably the greatest night in the history of television, right? That was — we had so much fun. The tears that were flowing out of —remember the tears from the totally non-biased anchors. We have another one of them coming up next week. You know Kristen Welker? She deleted her entire account. I wonder why; I can't imagine. You know, I've known her for a long time. She is extraordinarily unfair. But that's all right. We did very well the other night with the person I knew was even more unfair. Savannah. In fact, nobody has seen Savannah for two days. What happened to Savannah? What happened to Savannah? They said, “We'd like to give Savannah Guthrie.” I said, “That's alright. What difference does it make? They ask you a question, you give him an answer, right? It doesn't matter. But she was sort of jumping out of her seat. She was like flying for. She was like, “I told you. I told you.” I said, “I don't care what you told me.” What does that mean? No, but we actually got A+ marks on that. But it was very unfair. And then you watch Sleepy Joe get interviewed by George Stephanopoulos. Nice guy, but he's a tough guy, and he's tough. I interviewed with him two weeks ago, he was tough. He's given, like these lobs, like this in slow-motion lobs. No, it's unfair. But you know what? It's so unfair and we're president and they're not, right? That's how unfair it is. We're — we're. But they want to fund extreme late-term abortion. They want a pack – Well, you got to get out and vote. You got to get out and vote. Got to get out and vote. They want to pack the Supreme Court. You know what that is? They could end up with 16, 19, 20. They want to put far-left judges on the court. They're going to pick people so far left, and you'll end up with far-left justices like we've never had ever before. And our Supreme Court, instead of being what it is now, revered, will end up being nothing. And they want to protect criminals and disarmed law-abiding Americans. They want to take away your Second Amendment. If Biden wins the lawless demonstrators in our streets and you see them all the time, they're Democratic-run. You know, I always say Democrat. You know why? Because it sounds worse. They should actually change their name to the Democratic — Democrat sounds lousy but you know what? That's actually their name. The Democrat Party, right? The Democrat Party. So I always say, "Democrat," they say, "Democratic," I said, "Why don't you try changing your name officially?” But the lawless demonstrators and they are, they're all Democrat-run cities and states, almost every single one of them, and they don't want to really take care of it. They don't want to take care of law enforcement. They want to cut — you see what's going on in Seattle. First of all, the police who we love, they're all quitting. They're all leaving. And they'd still be occupying Seattle, except they found out that we were going in the morning that they all raised their hands. The reason they raised their hands is we were going in that morning. We're going to take over. Can you believe it? We're going to take over the section — the large section of Seattle that these anarchists had — they're anarchists. That's all they are. But, you know, in theory — Law and order is right. In theory, we have to be asked. We have to be asked to do it. The federal government has to be asked. But we went into Minneapolis and you know what happened? How long did that take? About 30 minutes. Remember, they formed a line. They formed another line. They were not socially distanced, which is very bad, in fact, we — they were very close. They had the world's most expensive uniforms on, they had helmets that cost a fortune. There was more computer stuff going on in those helmets. But, you know, under the helmets, great brains, and I'll — and tough. And they formed those lines. And then they said, “Okay, let's go.” This is after two weeks of destruction in Minneapolis. That's why we're going to win Minnesota for the first time since 1972, Republican Party. We're going to win. Now it doesn't hurt that in Minnesota they have Ilhan Omar, who hates your country, who has broken the law, I mean she's broken the law. Let's see what happens. But she's broken the law. But she hates our country. No, we're going to We're going to win because of what we did with Minneapolis. We saved Minneapolis and we saved Seattle. I mean Seattle was going real bad and all we want to — do you want to know the truth, sort of saving the whole country if you really think about it. And that's why we have spirit, the likes of which I don't think any campaign has ever had. That's what's happened. That's what's happened. You know something? I just left Michigan. You know that. Look forward to coming over here, but I just left and the early voting is going big. It should. It should go like it's supposed to go, like 70 percent, 80 percent to the Democrats and then we come in with the big, red wave. It's going to be a wave like nobody's ever seen, because our people want to get out and vote so they'll start big, heavy when it gets, you know, the early voting but especially on that November 3rd day, we're going to swamping it. But here's what happened, and this is early, so this is early, but, you know, still hundreds of thousands of votes. Here's what happened. So we're supposed to be down, you know, big. And then we catch it like a race horse, a race horse. Secretariat would start off and (INAUDIBLE). Well, that was what was supposed to sort of happened and then you see what happens in the end. And I think we win. But something strange has happened in Michigan. You know, we brought back many car plants. Many, many. They hadn't brought back a plant, I think, it's 42 years and we brought back many and expansion of the car plants. So in Michigan, a strange thing has happened. We're leading substantially in the early voting. What's that all about? What is that all about? Because something's happening out there. Look, I mean, take a look at this crowd. You can't see it, as far as the eye can see you have people. As far as the eye can see. This election day the people of Wisconsin and you know what? We win Wisconsin, we win the whole ball game. I mean, what the hell do you think I'm doing here in a freezing night with 45 degree winds? What do you think? Think I'm doing this for my health? I'm not doing this for my health. I'm doing it for that. And I'm doing it for that. How beautiful that is. Wow. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. But this election day, the people of Wisconsin must stop these anti-American radicals by issuing sleepy Joe Biden — he has no clue anyway, Look, let's not kid ourselves. Let's not kid ourselves. He's shot. Okay? I don't care. Think of it. Think of it because this puts pressure on you. I am running against, perhaps in the history of presidential politics, the worst candidate. Obama wouldn't even endorse him. They ran together. They went together, eight years. And then even after he won, I didn't think Obama —it took so long. Right? And now I heard today they said, “Sir.” “What?” “We have a little problem.” “What?” “Obama is going to campaign for him.” I said, "Well, that's good news." He campaigned harder than Hillary Clinton did for Hillary and it just made us stronger. I want him to campaign so much. I want him to campaign you know because we're going to do even better. But it is true.
