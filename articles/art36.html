You’re probably listening to this on an Apple iPhone. The mic I’m using — it was ordered on Amazon. And to record this interview, my guest and I have been forced to download Google Chrome. Its big tech’s world. We just live in it. But do we have to? It took a simple idea from a 28-year-old student to challenge today’s richest and most powerful companies. Her name is Lina Khan. She called them out first in an eviscerating paper about Amazon and antitrust, which she wrote while at Yale Law School. Then as a key player in the recent congressional hearings, the most comprehensive government investigation big tech has ever seen. So my first question, Mr. Pichai, is why does Google steal content from honest businesses? You’ve used Facebook’s power to threaten smaller competitors and to ensure that you can always get your way. So the question is why one rule for the developers that compete with you and the opposite rule for Apple? You instructed Amazon employees to approach discussions with certain business partners, and I quote, “the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.” Now tech C.E.O.s like Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, and Sundar Pichai are on the defense in part because of Lina Khan’s work. It may pave the way for massive new legislation and the possible breakup of their companies. In the meantime, the battle plays out in the courts. The Department of Justice just filed a major antitrust lawsuit against Google last week. It’s the first of its kind in over 20 years. Let’s start with just the news of what’s happened recently because it’s the first time that the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google. Can you just explain for people who don’t understand what it alleges? Sure. So the Justice Department filed a complaint against Google alleging that Google had illegally maintained and extended its monopolies in the market for general online search. So the crux of it is Google is a monopoly in general online search. Over 90% of all online search queries happen on Google. On mobile devices, it’s even higher. It’s closer to 94%. And the Justice Department alleged that Google basically has maintained this monopoly through a series of anti-competitive exclusionary agreements. These boil down to two types. So one is basically a set of agreements that required mobile device manufacturers to pre-install Google search. So you have Android, and you have Apple. In between those two, Google has locked up default status on mobile devices in the United States. And just basically happened because when search was migrating from desktop to mobile, Google kind of panicked, right? This is kind of what the classic monopolist does when the underlying platform threatens to change the monopolist panics. And so Google wanted to ensure that it could retain its monopoly even as search migrated to mobile. And the Justice Department alleges that this was anti-competitive, and that now with searches similarly migrating to other devices such as smart sneakers, smartwatches, Google could be in the position to do the same thing. Now, over the years, everyone’s known as the Google has the enormous advantage at search. This is not a new fresh thing. The F.T.C. looked at it. All kinds of agencies have discussed this. And it’s just the numbers have been the numbers for many years. That’s exactly right. These are not, by any means, a new set of facts. The European Commission actually brought a close-to-identical case back in 2018 which followed a multi-year investigation. So these facts have been in some way or another known for the better part of a decade. And for people who don’t realize it when you open a phone, they have Google on there, you can actually go into the system and change it. But nobody does it, and so Google maintains the ability across all mobile platforms of which there are only really two. And that’s what you get, essentially. That’s right. And the fact that Google pays billions and billions of each year to secure this default status shows the immense value that this brings to Google. I mean, Google wouldn’t pay this much if it was so easy for users to switch away from Google. And Apple is advantaged by it. Exactly. So when you saw the lawsuit, what was the first thing you thought? Finally? Or — Finally, [CHUCKLES] Yeah. I mean, it’s been 20 years — the antitrust laws have been on a slumber for 20 years. It’s kind of been this deep ice age. And this is kind of the first trickle of kind of progress. And so I think from that perspective, it felt hugely significant. I think when you kind of study it a bit more closely, you’re like, OK, isn’t anything very new here. But hey, at least, it’s a start. OK. So talk a little bit about why this is a big deal. And explain where we are in U.S. antitrust law right now, which was written what year? The first federal antitrust law was passed in 1890. And then we had a second set of laws in 1914. What was the big industry in that year? Back then one of the main industries was the railroads as well as the series of industrial trusts, steel, tobacco, sugar. These were kind of the big trusts back then. So a while ago. Yes. OK. [CHUCKLES] This case is significant because the last time the Justice Department brought a major monopolization case was in the late ‘90s against Microsoft. So it’s been virtually 20 years since we saw a significant monopolization case. And that’s not for lack of targets. Over the last 30 years, the entire U.S. economy has become increasingly concentrated, where market after market is dominated by a small number of companies. So this is true in tech, but it’s also true in agriculture. It’s true in airlines. It’s true in mattress manufacturing. You just pick an industry, and it’s likely to be dominated by a small number of companies. So because there was a broader shift in the antitrust laws where 40 years ago there was the Chicago School revolution that really upended the foundational goals of antitrust. It’s the kind of set of judges and economists primarily based at the University of Chicago. Importantly, though, they had buy-in from certain liberals. Now, Justice Breyer, Alfred Kahn, Ted Kennedy, I mean, these were all supporters of this switch to what is known as the consumer welfare standard and antitrust. Which really significantly narrowed the scope of what types of harms enforcers are looking at when they’re trying to identify whether a company is acting monopolistically. So essentially, these companies have to hurt customers. And in the case of Microsoft, you didn’t have a choice. You were hurting not just customers, but rivals. Customers didn’t have a choice. Exactly. Yep. Microsoft was found to be blocking emerging competitors. And the Justice Department argued that hurt customers through hurting innovation. Mm-hmm. And so how is this different than Microsoft 22 years ago? I covered that, by the way. You were probably not born or something. [LAUGHTER] Or very young at some point. In grade school [LAUGHS] Yeah. I was hanging outside the courthouse. It was real fun. Very cool. So I think in actually quite many ways, this case does map onto Microsoft quite neatly in so far as that case was also about this dominant intermediary that was trying to stifle emerging predators and maintain its dominance through blocking Netscape and others from access to distribution, from access to customers. And the Justice Department is alleging that, in many key ways, Google’s doing the same thing. It’s depriving potential rival search engines from access to customers by locking up all of the key distribution channels where users go to actually search in the first place. So in that sense, it’s actually quite similar. And I think many commentators noted that the Justice Department seemed to be leaning heavily on the Microsoft precedent to try and have the strongest case it can, especially given that judges have become much less favorable to antitrust plaintiffs. One thing that’s different is people hated Microsoft at the time, including the tech industry. In this case, you have not just Google but other big companies like Amazon and Facebook. People like the products of these companies. Is that a big difference in sort of getting people angry about this issue? I think it’s right that users generally recognize the immense value that these services and technologies have brought. But it does seem that in the last few years public opinion is shifting. And people are able to both recognize that Google services may be great, but Google as a business may be stifling competition. It may be hurting innovation. It may not have our best interests in mind when it comes to user data usage and privacy. There have been some remarkable public polls suggesting that a vast majority of Americans are actually quite wary of the enormous power that these firms now wield over our economy as well as over our democracy. We’re leaning on a very old act and at the same time leaning on a very old interpretation of the act back from Microsoft right now. Is this idea of the curse of the big is that Americans in general don’t like big companies ultimately when they coalesce around? Yeah. So the foundational kind of insight was that concentration of economic power concentrations, of private power posed a threat to our democracy and our liberties in the same ways that Americans recognize the concentrations of political power do. And so there was a fundamental understanding that in the same way that in our political sphere, in our government system, we ensure a system of checks and balances, we want to avoid excessive concentration of power in any individual actor or any individual branch, that we should apply a similar set of principles when thinking about our economy. So you rose to prominence the paper about traditional thinking around antitrust law, which is what you’re talking about now. It has allowed big tech to get away with these monopolies. Why were you so interested in this subject? What got you like, I cannot stand these large companies? And you focused on Amazon. You focused on Amazon. But you could apply to all the tech companies. Yeah You could apply to all the tech companies. I actually got my start through reporting and through reporting on all sorts of non-tech industries. So I actually spent several months reporting on agriculture industries, specifically looking at poultry farming, understanding how that industry had become highly concentrated, studying the airline industry, studying copper, steel, and really getting this understanding that there had been the structural shift across our economy towards fewer and fewer dominant firms. So what bothered you? why? No, not this. There’s so many things to say, no, not this at. I think it was the recognition that when firms become so big they really are able to exercise unaccountable and arbitrary power. And at the extreme, they really start functioning as forms of private governments, right? For most people, their everyday interaction with power is not so much with their member of Congress or local representative. It’s really what their employer. It’s really with a business partner. Their boss. Their boss. Exactly. And so ensuring some kind of equitable distributions of power in our economic life is really central to our democracy. And so I started looking at the technology companies because they seemed to be an extension of the dynamics that we were seeing in all of these other industries. But they also seem to be this really elegant example of how this consumer-focused approach to antitrust really renders us blind to all of the ways the big firms can exercise power in really problematic ways. And so I kind of studied Amazon to showcase and tell this broader story of how this consumerist approach to antitrust is really narrow and ignores all of these basic realities. It’s interesting where you pick elegant, because it’s like sort of lawless. I have my own legal theories, as you know, not having gone to law school. I call it the cheap date theory. Is they hand us a dating app or the map or a communications, and then we give away everything to them, and they control all of it. And so we’re cheap dates to all these companies. It’s not a very good reflection on consumers. But we give away a lot for very little even though we think we’re getting a lot. So you wrote this paper in law school. You went to Yale, is that correct? And talk about what you were proposing in trying to shift the traditional thinking about this. So I wrote about how Amazon had become so dominant through relying on a variety of business practices that frankly 50 years ago would have been found to be illegal. It engaged in predatory pricing. So that’s, as you were alluding to when you price a good below cost, it kind of give cheap stuff and luring customers, but then also drive our rivals. And in certain cases, like with diapers, they did that strategy with an explicit goal of driving out a rival. There are documents that the House, Antitrust Subcommittee uncovered where Amazon executives at a pretty high level were saying, hey, this company Diapers.com, it’s our biggest competitor. I think we should take them out. So that was one business strategy — predatory pricing. And then as well as vertical integration. So this is when you kind of expand into different parts of a particular supply chain, so you control every part of the line of business. Also expanding into things like private label, which basically means that you’re the central marketplace for all of these other businesses, but then you’re also competing with those same businesses. And yet you also have access to all of their intimate commercial data. So Amazon has been able to use the data of all of these customers and weaponize that data against them as rivals. So it’s able to really have— its kind of access at scale to a near-perfect market data gives it just unparalleled insight into market trends, market developments. And it’s able to use that information to compete against and oftentimes demote these third party businesses that are dependent on Amazon. So for example, I interviewed the people at Away. They had created a suitcase that got very popular. We’re relatively innovative suitcase. They’ve been around, but they sort of popularized this sort of hard shelled suitcase. And they didn’t want to put their products on Amazon because they were terrified that Amazon would understand this is suddenly going to become a popular item and copy it. But now, even without them being on there, they figured out other hard shell companies and now have an Amazon offering. And they can do that in almost anything and see the signals. So whether it’s hard shelled suitcases, or suddenly everybody wants whatever kombucha. They can look at it and then copy it. That’s exactly right. And I think there are two main issues. One is that Amazon has this unique access to data, right? It’s kind of all of these other businesses are like create a petri dish for Amazon where it’s conducting all these experiments, and then it can kind of unfairly, without actually undertaking the original risk of bringing a product to market, just swoop in and take that reward. Yeah. This looks good. This Looks good. We’ll introduce it. And then hey, well, that suitcase manufacturer that was on page one because everybody’s loved its products, we’ll just move it to page three to page four, and it effectively disappears for users, right? So there’s a variety— Or put an ad on the top and charge a lesser price. Exactly. And these are types of business practices that, again, used to be looked at very unfavorably. We kind of, in many cases, found them to be illegal. And over the last 40 years, judges and enforcers have said, actually, these types of business practices benefit consumers. We’re basically not going to enforce the law against them. So when you wrote your paper, it just hit like an atom bomb in the industry. What were you doing that was different? I think I was questioning the current orthodoxy and whether it had led us astray, and whether it really was equipping us to deal with these digital platforms in particular, which at that point — this is 2017 — were still largely seen as being extremely beneficial for consumers. And I think that was seen as controversial at the time. And why? You were proposing that they look at other things besides harm to consumers, or there was calm to consumers in ways you didn’t see even if you liked what you were getting. Exactly. That there could be long-term harms to consumers. But that also, the antitrust laws were not just about consumer prices. They really needed to look at the structure of the market. They needed to look at power dynamics between these different business entities. They needed to really take into account the long term, right? So if Amazon was structurally amassing so much power, we shouldn’t just assume that a new business would be able to contest that. I mean, I think one thing that the shift in antitrust over the last 40 years has done is that it’s baked in all these assumptions about how markets work that just don’t correspond to reality. They kind of assume that if you have a monopolist that starts abusing its monopoly power, that all of a sudden all of these new businesses will enter and discipline that company, undercut them. And that’s just not the reality. I mean, who’s going to really try to start up an e-commerce marketplace to compete with Amazon in a full-fledged way? And especially as more of their predatory practices are coming to account, be it with Amazon, be it with Facebook, be it with Google, for the fact that they have this near-perfect market intelligence it can use that to cut off any competitor, to buy up that competitor, to introduce replica services. You hear from venture capitalists and investors that this is having a chilling effect. That they’re less likely to invest. It seems like you’re pointing out the— not to say that your work isn’t great, but it’s kind of pointing out the obvious. These people are too big, and you can’t get around them. That’s essentially — I’m going to de-lawyer it for you. But why do you think it caused such a stir? I think the real moment where I started getting a lot more interest was in the summer of 2017 when Amazon bought at Whole Foods. And I think that was — for a lot of people, that was the first moment where they kind of stepped back. And that was close to $14 billion deal. And they just started thinking, what are the scope of Amazon’s ambitions? And is there any point at which we’re going to say, that this company can’t expand, can’t get bigger, can’t get more powerful because we think it’s harmful to our economy our democracy? And I think that Whole Foods transaction I think was a bit of an inflection point in kind of the public thinking about this issue. All right. So your work challenges powerful billionaires that shape our world. And they have gotten through that the Facebook is quite close to the Trump administration. Google was very close to the Obama administration. These are very powerful people. Do you enjoy that — the ability to use your mind in that way to use power? I enjoy it. I know I do but how do you feel about having created this enormous focus on a no to people that never get the word no? [LAUGHS] I mean, it’s been a world wind of a few years, but I think it’s enormously exciting. And I think it’s a growing movement of people who are both recognizing the problem, who are writing about the problem, who want to go into government to solve the problem. And I think it does feel that we’re on the cusp of a turning point. We are at an inflection point. And that we could be seeing transformative change in the coming years. Now people have tried to minimize you by labeling you the leader of the — it’s an incredible thing — “hipster antitrust” movement. What do you think of that term? And what do you say to them? Like, fine. What is your — [LAUGHS] I don’t even know what “hipster antitrust” movement. When I saw it, I was like, oh, very cute. Yeah it was kind of surprised by the name calling. I mean, I think it’s designed to be a pejorative to try and minimize the movement, but I do think that it also suggests that these ideas are powerful and threatening to a lot of very rich people. And so I think it’s inevitable that we’re going to see some tantrums, some backlash. It’s just going to be part of the ride. What are you most scared of in that regard? Is that these companies get — look, through Covid, they’re trillion companies now. The top seven, eight companies are all tech companies, and they’re in the trillion dollar range. The richest people in the world are all tech people, like to an obscene degree. It’s crazy the amount of money they have — the richest people in the history of the world. Warren Buffett’s in there, but he’s lost money this year, you know what I mean? He suffered during Covid, and he’s kind of a piker compared to the rest of these people. Is there a way to resist that? Because this is unheard of wealth, unheard of power, unheard of valuations. Yeah. I mean, I think that’s absolutely right. The challenges are going to be quite significant. But I do think this is an instance where we can draw from history, right? I mean, we’ve lived with tycoons and monopolies controlling industries before. John D. Rockefeller, Vanderbilt, these are people that also controlled swaths of the economy and had enormous political power. And yet we were able to pass laws, to file lawsuits to really ensure that they weren’t able to use that economic power in abusive and destructive ways. So I think this is a moment where we can draw from our history for courage. Do you fear retaliation? I mean, I think, especially as somebody pursuing academic work — I’m in a more secure position, not being dependent on one of these firms directly. But I think it’s something that everybody needs to be vigilant about how these firms are able to use their economic power to target research or ideas that they don’t like. [MUSIC PLAYING] We’ll be right back. If you like what you’re hearing hit subscribe to catch up on episodes you’ve missed and to get each new episode of “Sway” delivered directly to you. More with Lina Khan when we come back. [MUSIC PLAYING] So let’s talk about what you were working on, these congressional hearings in big tech. That’s right. So last March, I joined the House Antitrust Subcommittee. And we launched this investigation into digital markets looking at the power of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. It ended up being a 16-month investigation that spanned seven hearings. Millions of pages of documents that we collected from these companies, hundreds of interviews that we did with other businesses and entrepreneurs in these markets to really understand what is the reality of how business is done with these companies. And is there really competition? Is it possible to enter? Is it possible to compete on a level playing field? What are the effects on consumers? And we, three weeks ago now launched or issued a report with our findings documenting what evidence we had found about how these companies were exercising their power and then also identified a set of recommendations for what Congress should do going forward. All right, so you were interviewing Yelp and Spotify and all kinds of companies that had been affected by — in the case of Spotify, Apple had started a music service and was trying to charge them money they didn’t want to pay. In the case of Facebook, all kinds of different things in social media with Snapchat and others. Sort of give an idea of what you found. So one main takeaway was that these firms now function as gatekeepers over critical channels of distribution, right? And they kind of control key arteries of commerce and communications in the digital age. The second was that in key ways these firms have abused that power. So they’ve abused their control to charge extortionate fees, to impose oppressive contracts. They’ve also use that power to protect their power. So the fact that these firms have near-perfect intelligence through controlling this key infrastructure means that they’ve been able to identify emerging threats, and at key moments either buy up those rivals or squash them, cut them off, copy their services. And then lastly, they’re also using this gatekeeper power to extend their reach into new markets. So the system through things like self-preferencing, through predatory pricing through exclusionary agreements where they’re able to use their existing dominance in ways that privilege them as they try to enter new markets. Such as Amazon going into retail or cars or whatever they’re going into. Exactly. And this is partly because they have so much cash, but it’s also because they’re able to use their dominance to basically extract leverage from business partners in other areas, right? So we would hear from companies that said Amazon isn’t a big competitor and say that the media market. But they’re able to use their dominance in retail to say, hey we’re going to stop selling your products on Amazon.com if you don’t give us an advantage in this other market. And so those types of cross-market benefits I think end up being quite significant. So those were the key factual findings, as well as the fact that these business practices are having a range of harms, right? They’re undermining innovation and entrepreneurship. They’re undermining user privacy. They’re also leading to the degradation of the free and independent press, right, in so far as these firms are barely siphoning off ad revenue from traditional publishers. And that’s also really harming core economic and political liberties. I think one thing that surprised us as investigators was really the prevalence of fear in the market. I mean, you were naming some of the big players that have been a bit more vocal. But there are hundreds, if not thousands, of smaller or mid-sized players that are terrified to start to speak out publicly in any way. In many cases, they were scared to even do confidential interviews because they know that these firms have the ability with the push of a button to really threaten their entire livelihood. One of the things that I remember what I was struck by some of the emails that you got from these companies, which reminded me a lot of Microsoft emails in the old days. Two words that really struck out to me was land grab, meaning we’re going to grab as much as we can, which I can’t believe they typed that into an email, and neutralize. These were Facebook, I think. Explain those emails and what they were trying to get at. Yeah So these were emails that the House Judiciary Committee released when Mark Zuckerberg came to testify because members of Congress wanted to ask him about these emails that we found from high-level Facebook executives talking about how Facebook’s acquisition strategy was basically a land grab to buy up as many assets and kind of lock up the market, and that certain acquisitions such as their purchase of Instagram was an effort to really neutralize these competitive threats, which I think was extremely significant because there’d been a lot of speculation that Facebook bought up Instagram to neutralize the threat, but I don’t think we have seen publicly that type of documentary evidence. So that’s something that the house was able to get from Facebook and made public. So these are small companies they see. Instagram was very small, and it was starting to get popular. And instantly it was off the market. And by the way, Twitter was also looking at buying it. This is what happens that these companies see an opportunity, and they take it. Talk a little bit more of the things you found in this report. I think having studied these companies before, I think I was still surprised by just the huge information advantages they have. I mean, in many cases, they just have such structural information advantages that I think it’s difficult to imagine what fair competition could look like. So one example was we found that Google had used Android as kind of an information collection tool to really track. They had this program called the Lockbox Program. Oh, dear. They called it that? [LAUGHS] Go ahead. Or they were tracking in close detail, which apps were being downloaded; what the usage ratio of those apps were. And this was real-time market intelligence. Facebook had the similar ability to do that through an app company they bought. Yeah. It’s kind of a novel fact pattern for Facebook that we saw. Android was also doing it. Amazon has these capacities. And so when you think about these information collection capacities, and then you think about the scale at which these companies operate, I mean, it really does start to look like near-perfect market intelligence. And I think the companies that are competing with them are really at a structural disadvantage from that perspective. I think, in many instances, these firms have become smarter about what they do and don’t put in emails. But I do think we were able to see Jeff Bezos was saying in email that they were buying up Ring to acquire market position. Yeah. Explain that. Because I was like, what did you just say? Explain what you got him to say. So yeah. The major issue over the last year or two and one the Congress and members of Congress were really worked up about was this idea of Amazon using its third party sellers and their commercial data to identify what goods are popular and then using that data for its own private label for its own first-party products. And this is something that Amazon had vehemently denied even though there was a lot of public reporting. In April, I think it was, The Wall Street Journal published a big piece documenting numerous Amazon employees basically saying, yes, we did this routinely. Our higher ups knew we did this. The House was also able to interview employees, confirming this and further providing evidence. And so when we asked Jeff Bezos about this at the hearing, he basically said, listen, we have a policy in place that’s supposed to prevent employees from doing this, but we can’t insure at this moment that policy has never been violated, which I think was a bit of an— They’re peeking. They’re peeking, right? That’s really — They’re peeking under the hood. Yeah, exactly. And I think several members found that quite underwhelming an answer. I mean this is a C.E.O. of one of those powerful companies in the world, the richest man in the world. And the fact that he couldn’t account for this pretty basic fact that there had been enormous amount of attention on I think raised basic questions about whether his company was too big to manage, or whether he was being deliberately evasive. So oops was not good enough for you. Oops. [LAUGHS] How did I see that? How did I look in the diary over there kind of thing? It was a weird response, I thought. But it’s too irresistible in lots of ways not to avail yourself to the information you have right in front of you and take a shortcut, really. I think that’s a really excellent point. And I think it raises a basic question about whether we can rely on these companies to self-police. And I think your point is that, no, we can’t. We really need to, I think, address the underlying incentive that they have to access the information in the first place and use this information in these ways, which is why the report recommended things like structural separations and line of business restrictions that would limit these firms from being able to collect and use that information in the first place. This is your first time working in a congressional setting. What was that like? I learned an enormous amount of from Congress. I mean, I think that the reason I really went over — one major reason I went over was because Congress used to be a really active player in antitrust, right? Through the ‘50s and ‘60s, Congress used to do these types of deep dives into corporate power, and do these deep studies understanding how were these dominant businesses potentially abusing their power. They’d call in the C.E.O.s. They’d do these hundreds of interviews and really create these multi-volume records that, I think, were enormously helpful both for — We’re watching you. That we’re watching you. The we’re watching you. The oversight, the Congressional oversight of these enormously powerful people in our economy and our democracy. And then also had the effect of pressuring enforcers, right? Creating this ambient pressure to enforcers that Congress is finding wrongdoing. If you kind of look over to the agencies, and they’re just kind of sitting on their hands, it kind of raises the question of what are you really doing with your time? So I think those benefits of investigations were really top of mind when I got the offer to go join and kind of helped revive this tradition that Congress has not really pursued and in recent years. Chairman Cicilline, he said this was the most significant congressional investigation of corporate power done in 50 years. What has been lost in that push-pull of Congress, the agencies, et cetera? Because it’s not a fresh thing in the Trump administration, even though Trump has cut regulations and such. But this is not a new thing. This goes back. I think that’s absolutely right. And one of the findings of the House report was that there has been failure by both the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. I mean, Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple made over 500 acquisitions. Only a handful were even seriously looked at. Of Facebook’s acquisitions, the F.T.C. only really investigated the Instagram one. And even that, with the emails that you’ve now seen, they allowed it to go through. So I do think we’re kind of looking at multi-decade institutional failure that has variety of factors and causes, but I do think there needs to be a bit of a moment of reckoning and renewal at the agencies to kind of do more. You’re young. You get tech. You’ve been steeped in this, as I have been covering it for decades. Now, do you think congressional representatives understand tech? Because that’s sort of the image during the Zuckerberg hearing when they were asking him how to fix their Facebook, essentially. It looked ridiculous. From a public point of view, it looks ridiculous in a lot of. cases. And in your hearing, it looked that people were pretty up to speed on what’s happening here, got the basics of power. I think that’s absolutely right. I think there’s been an enormous amount of learning over the last few years. And you have committees of jurisdictions. So our committee specifically is on antitrust, and members have been doing this investigation for over a year by the time we invited those C.E.O.s. We deliberately timed it that way to make sure we had the information; we had the documents; we had the evidence. The members of Congress had time to kind of study that evidence. And I think you’re absolutely right. I do think their questions reveal the level of sophistication that it seems to people by surprise. Maybe even took some of the executives by surprise. Questions about ad tech or specific acquisitions, the intricacies of how certain markets work— I think these are all things that members of Congress are definitely much more fluent in. And frankly, at the end of the day, they’re the ones with legislative authority. All right, well, let’s talk about the bipartisanship because you did have representative Jordan going down a conservative bias highway, which they love to go down without any kind of proof. How do you deal with that because it’s become so politicized? You feel it’s a bipartisan effort? Because you can have a bipartisan effort, and two people think they should regulate them for different reasons. You’ve got the president putting out these executive orders that are, I think, written by a 12-year-old. I don’t understand. They don’t make any sense. And my problem with that is that you have only so many shots of these people. And if you do a crappy shot, you’re never getting it again. You’re right that when it came to recommendations, there was some disagreement. I think what was significant was A, that the investigation at its inception was bipartisan. So when you sent these document requests to Jeff Bezos, to Mark Zuckerberg, they had the signatures of not just the Democratic members, but also the Republican. And I think that was quite important from to kind of require these companies to take this investigation seriously in the first place. I do think, though, that the report that the member representative Buck wrote and had the signature of the other Republicans on— that report basically said that it agreed with the vast majority of the findings of the majority, which is quite significant when you think about what our findings was with regards to the monopolistic control these firms enjoy. There were several recommendations that they said they agreed with that included things like increasing funding for the agencies. There were several recommendations they said they were open to learning more about, such as shifting the presumption in merger enforcement, which basically would say that the government no longer had the burden of proof. It would be the companies, which sounds like a technical legal thing. But I think, for practical purposes, it has a huge deal. And there were certain other areas of antitrust reform that would have a huge impact that they were if not onboard with, then certainly open to. I think that’s in an enormous and remarkable degree of agreement, I would say. The areas where they disagreed was with things like structural separations, line of business restrictions, as well as some of the recommendations to strengthen what are known as private rights of action. So this is the ability of private parties to sue, which was historically a really important part of the antitrust laws, right? Congress recognized that if the only people that you give power to enforce the antitrust laws or public regulators, there’s going to be a good chance that they’re going to get captured by the very monopolies they’re supposed to oversee. And so that’s why you need to give — Lobbyists is you’re saying. Lobbyists, right. You need to give everyday people, the people who are hurt by this monopoly power, the ability to also file lawsuits. So when you look at this report — you finish this report. Then you’ve now gone to Columbia Law School. I mean, you’re teaching there. What do you hope to have happen? Are you hopeful that this hearing will lead to new legislation? I am hopeful. I mean, I think, practically speaking, the next step is going to be that there would have to be a markup where the committee adopts this report formally and adopts its findings and recommendations. But I think where we’re going to start seeing bills be introduced. I mean, I think we going to very quickly see — Individual bills on lots of issues. Exactly. I think there’s going to be a discussion among the caucus, among members to figure out what approach do they want to take. But I think there is an immense amount of interest among members on this subcommittee, but also more broadly across Congress to start legislating. If you could wave a wand — you’re ahead of the internet — what would you want? What do you think the most critical ones are? Breakup? Or you have my most interesting moment I think this year is when Zuckerberg called Elizabeth Warren his existential threat. And I think I texted him. I was like, not climate change? Not a meteor hurtling towards us? Not death, you know what I mean? There’s so many existential crises in this world. But there she is. There she is. But what do you think the most important — if you had to pick two or three things that have to happen to get this started, what would you say they are? I think the structural breakups are going to be really important. I think one of the main findings of the report was how these firms have been able to leverage their monopoly into all of these other areas. And I think unless you put a very clear stop to that, it’s going to be an increasingly difficult problem to solve. I also think we need to rehabilitate the antitrust laws. They’re just decades of judicial precedent of really bad court opinions that have extremely narrowed what these laws are supposed to be about. And I think if Congress was able to override a lot of that case law, it would just re-empower both the antitrust agencies, but also a lot of private parties to start bringing these cases. So what would be the key changes? So I think one key change is to monopolization law to basically make it undo a lot of the hurdles that the courts have introduced. I think with regards to mergers, we do need to basically shift the burden of proof, especially when you have dominant firms acquiring smaller companies or going on these wholesale buying sprees. I do think the presumption to be in certain cases that those acquisitions are anti-competitive unless proven otherwise. So that they have to prove why they should be able to buy it versus the government proving why they should— What are benefits of this purchase? And then also what is preventing you from entering this market through internal growth? I mean, the fact that these firms have acquired a vast majority of their technologies, I think, does in some cases undercut the view — It’s common. — yeah. That they’re kind of there at the fountain of all this innovation. It’s like, no, in many cases, you’ve actually bought out this innovation that others created. And in some cases, you did so to prevent it from dislodging your own monopoly position. The words they have are fascinating. I love lockbox. I mean, literally, they pull from the evil people’s handbook. But one of my favorite is killer acquisition. Explain what that is because you talked about it in the report. Yeah. So a killer acquisition is when these firms acquire a company for the purpose of shutting it down, for the purpose of killing it because they recognize that a product could be a threat to them. So that’s something that the report identifies that Facebook did in several cases. But it’s something that we’ve seen across these firms. They brag about it. They brag about doing that in Silicon Valley. It’s amazing. I was sort of like, you’re buying it so you could end it, so that they don’t — I mean, it’s really quite out in the open. That’s the thing is what’s really interesting about all this is they don’t hide from it what they’re doing. They revel in it. In fact, other small startups want to be acquired this way, or create a product they know will be killed, essentially. And VCs want this to happen. Yeah. I think that sense of impunity is something that we see across the board. Yeah. They don’t think you can touch them. I don’t think sort of this evil rub your hands now we’ve got them kind of thing. They just feel like this is the way it should be, and you’re in their way in terms of innovation. Don’t get in our way, government, because we’re creating jobs. We’re creating this. We’re creating that. And we know better, essentially. So when you’re thinking about a breakup, what would be— for each of these companies, would you mind giving me one for each of them? Google? I think with Google, there are a lot of conflicts across its business, and one area is in the ad tech market, which is a very technical area of its business. This is something that representative Jayapal spoke about at our hearing. Basically, Google controls the exchange where digital ads are bought and sold. But it also has a position on both sides of the market. So it both sells and buys and controls the underlying exchange. And the technology. And the underlying technology, exactly. And breakups to eliminate those conflicts of interest are going to be really important. I think with some of the other firms, there’s a big conversation around whether a Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were anti-competitive. And if so, whether those should be unwound as part of this broader strategy to monopolize the market. But Lina, they changed the name to Instagram by Facebook. You can do that now. [LAUGHS] But in the report there was interviewed a former employee that was actually trying to rebut the idea that it would be so complicated to break up Instagram. It’s Facebook. They were like, it’s code. It’s a bunch of numbers. You can just move them from this column to that column. So I think it’s true that in some cases, there may be certain types of issues that need to be thought through, but I think the reflex response is, oh, this is just so complicated — It’s too hard. — I can’t do it. And I think we need to move past that a bit. Let me give you a tip, Lina. It’s always really hard when it’s something they don’t want to do. It’s super easy and trivial when it’s something they want to do. They’re the smartest people on Earth when they want to be. All right, Apple and Amazon. I’d love to hear from you on that. So I don’t think breakups is going to be the answer in every case. I think with Apple, we need to think through — in any given day any app developer can be delisted. And so those types of I think inequalities of bargaining power need to be addressed. With Amazon, I think there are a variety of conflicts. One major one that the report found was between its third party retail business and its first party retail business. So Amazon both is a platform for all of these other sellers, but also sell its own products on it both private label but also wholesale goods that it buys. And I think there’s a real question about whether that creates a conflict of interest that needs to be addressed. The report also found that in certain cases Amazon — what’s known as ties its fulfillment and logistics services to the platform so that in certain cases, you can only win the buy box as a merchant if you’re also buying Amazon’s logistics and fulfillment services. So I think that’s another potential conflict that could be addressed. That’s important. That’s a very important thing that people don’t realize. You have to use their things. And if they buy a UPS or something like that, which has been rumored, that they could really have every single aspect of the transaction in their corner, and they’re under their control between them. That’s right. And the report actually quoted merchants that said we’re forced to use Amazon’s logistic services not because it’s the best thing out there, but because if we don’t use it, we don’t have a shot at the buy box. And we had a couple say that the only negative reviews I ever get — or the main negative reviews I’ve gotten from the times when I use Amazon services. So this suggests that it really is a form of coercion that merchants feel compelled to use these services in certain cases. Your expertise is not Section 230, which protects internet company. It protects a lot of things. It’s a very complex law that was passed many decades ago. They have brought immunity in ways other industries don’t. Is that going to get in the way of this kind of regulation and actions that you’ve been proposing? I think these are fairly discrete issues. I mean, I think there are areas of overlap, but I don’t think that the 230 immunity is going to impede antitrust actions or push us for new legislation. I think these are separate issues in that sense. So when you think about the impact you’ve had, five years hence, what would you like to see? How does innovation live? I think if we have rules of the road that are protecting innovation and encouraging innovation, that’s going to have to come from renewed antitrust laws from lawsuits that penalize monopolies that try to crush competitors, that try to crush new entrants. And I think that’s going to be the path to ensure that the next wave of Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apples are also able to emerge and are not just going to be crushed in the crib but by the current giants. When we started today, you were on Firefox. And you had to download Chrome for this. You don’t have Chrome, which is a Google product. That’s right. I don’t use Chrome. I’m the same way. I don’t like Chrome, and it’s here on my computer. I don’t want Google. And I was married to a Google person. I was like, get all Google products off my computer. What can individual people do? Give some people some tips for in this monopoly group? What do you think average citizens should be doing in this case, or thinking about? I think they should be organizing for political change and for legislative change. I mean, I do think this is an area where there’s often a temptation to push for consumer boycotts. But I do think that kind of gets us into a confused place because in many cases, these are emerging to be infrastructure, right? We don’t ask people to boycott highways to make them safer. We don’t ask people to boycott core services because we’re so dependent on them. I mean, I think these are questions that we need to encounter not as consumers but as political citizens given that I do think the reforms need to be legislative and come from government. All right, Lina, thank you so much. Thanks so much, Kara. [MUSIC PLAYING] “Sway” is a production of New York Times Opinion.

You’re probably listening to this on an Apple iPhone. The mic I’m using — it was ordered on Amazon. And to record this interview, my guest and I have been forced to download Google Chrome. Its big tech’s world. We just live in it. But do we have to? It took a simple idea from a 28-year-old student to challenge today’s richest and most powerful companies. Her name is Lina Khan. She called them out first in an eviscerating paper about Amazon and antitrust, which she wrote while at Yale Law School. Then as a key player in the recent congressional hearings, the most comprehensive government investigation big tech has ever seen. So my first question, Mr. Pichai, is why does Google steal content from honest businesses? You’ve used Facebook’s power to threaten smaller competitors and to ensure that you can always get your way. So the question is why one rule for the developers that compete with you and the opposite rule for Apple? You instructed Amazon employees to approach discussions with certain business partners, and I quote, “the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.” Now tech C.E.O.s like Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, and Sundar Pichai are on the defense in part because of Lina Khan’s work. It may pave the way for massive new legislation and the possible breakup of their companies. In the meantime, the battle plays out in the courts. The Department of Justice just filed a major antitrust lawsuit against Google last week. It’s the first of its kind in over 20 years. Let’s start with just the news of what’s happened recently because it’s the first time that the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google. Can you just explain for people who don’t understand what it alleges? Sure. So the Justice Department filed a complaint against Google alleging that Google had illegally maintained and extended its monopolies in the market for general online search. So the crux of it is Google is a monopoly in general online search. Over 90% of all online search queries happen on Google. On mobile devices, it’s even higher. It’s closer to 94%. And the Justice Department alleged that Google basically has maintained this monopoly through a series of anti-competitive exclusionary agreements. These boil down to two types. So one is basically a set of agreements that required mobile device manufacturers to pre-install Google search. So you have Android, and you have Apple. In between those two, Google has locked up default status on mobile devices in the United States. And just basically happened because when search was migrating from desktop to mobile, Google kind of panicked, right? This is kind of what the classic monopolist does when the underlying platform threatens to change the monopolist panics. And so Google wanted to ensure that it could retain its monopoly even as search migrated to mobile. And the Justice Department alleges that this was anti-competitive, and that now with searches similarly migrating to other devices such as smart sneakers, smartwatches, Google could be in the position to do the same thing. Now, over the years, everyone’s known as the Google has the enormous advantage at search. This is not a new fresh thing. The F.T.C. looked at it. All kinds of agencies have discussed this. And it’s just the numbers have been the numbers for many years. That’s exactly right. These are not, by any means, a new set of facts. The European Commission actually brought a close-to-identical case back in 2018 which followed a multi-year investigation. So these facts have been in some way or another known for the better part of a decade. And for people who don’t realize it when you open a phone, they have Google on there, you can actually go into the system and change it. But nobody does it, and so Google maintains the ability across all mobile platforms of which there are only really two. And that’s what you get, essentially. That’s right. And the fact that Google pays billions and billions of each year to secure this default status shows the immense value that this brings to Google. I mean, Google wouldn’t pay this much if it was so easy for users to switch away from Google. And Apple is advantaged by it. Exactly. So when you saw the lawsuit, what was the first thing you thought? Finally? Or — Finally, [CHUCKLES] Yeah. I mean, it’s been 20 years — the antitrust laws have been on a slumber for 20 years. It’s kind of been this deep ice age. And this is kind of the first trickle of kind of progress. And so I think from that perspective, it felt hugely significant. I think when you kind of study it a bit more closely, you’re like, OK, isn’t anything very new here. But hey, at least, it’s a start. OK. So talk a little bit about why this is a big deal. And explain where we are in U.S. antitrust law right now, which was written what year? The first federal antitrust law was passed in 1890. And then we had a second set of laws in 1914. What was the big industry in that year? Back then one of the main industries was the railroads as well as the series of industrial trusts, steel, tobacco, sugar. These were kind of the big trusts back then. So a while ago. Yes. OK. [CHUCKLES] This case is significant because the last time the Justice Department brought a major monopolization case was in the late ‘90s against Microsoft. So it’s been virtually 20 years since we saw a significant monopolization case. And that’s not for lack of targets. Over the last 30 years, the entire U.S. economy has become increasingly concentrated, where market after market is dominated by a small number of companies. So this is true in tech, but it’s also true in agriculture. It’s true in airlines. It’s true in mattress manufacturing. You just pick an industry, and it’s likely to be dominated by a small number of companies. So because there was a broader shift in the antitrust laws where 40 years ago there was the Chicago School revolution that really upended the foundational goals of antitrust. It’s the kind of set of judges and economists primarily based at the University of Chicago. Importantly, though, they had buy-in from certain liberals. Now, Justice Breyer, Alfred Kahn, Ted Kennedy, I mean, these were all supporters of this switch to what is known as the consumer welfare standard and antitrust. Which really significantly narrowed the scope of what types of harms enforcers are looking at when they’re trying to identify whether a company is acting monopolistically. So essentially, these companies have to hurt customers. And in the case of Microsoft, you didn’t have a choice. You were hurting not just customers, but rivals. Customers didn’t have a choice. Exactly. Yep. Microsoft was found to be blocking emerging competitors. And the Justice Department argued that hurt customers through hurting innovation. Mm-hmm. And so how is this different than Microsoft 22 years ago? I covered that, by the way. You were probably not born or something. [LAUGHTER] Or very young at some point. In grade school [LAUGHS] Yeah. I was hanging outside the courthouse. It was real fun. Very cool. So I think in actually quite many ways, this case does map onto Microsoft quite neatly in so far as that case was also about this dominant intermediary that was trying to stifle emerging predators and maintain its dominance through blocking Netscape and others from access to distribution, from access to customers. And the Justice Department is alleging that, in many key ways, Google’s doing the same thing. It’s depriving potential rival search engines from access to customers by locking up all of the key distribution channels where users go to actually search in the first place. So in that sense, it’s actually quite similar. And I think many commentators noted that the Justice Department seemed to be leaning heavily on the Microsoft precedent to try and have the strongest case it can, especially given that judges have become much less favorable to antitrust plaintiffs. One thing that’s different is people hated Microsoft at the time, including the tech industry. In this case, you have not just Google but other big companies like Amazon and Facebook. People like the products of these companies. Is that a big difference in sort of getting people angry about this issue? I think it’s right that users generally recognize the immense value that these services and technologies have brought. But it does seem that in the last few years public opinion is shifting. And people are able to both recognize that Google services may be great, but Google as a business may be stifling competition. It may be hurting innovation. It may not have our best interests in mind when it comes to user data usage and privacy. There have been some remarkable public polls suggesting that a vast majority of Americans are actually quite wary of the enormous power that these firms now wield over our economy as well as over our democracy. We’re leaning on a very old act and at the same time leaning on a very old interpretation of the act back from Microsoft right now. Is this idea of the curse of the big is that Americans in general don’t like big companies ultimately when they coalesce around? Yeah. So the foundational kind of insight was that concentration of economic power concentrations, of private power posed a threat to our democracy and our liberties in the same ways that Americans recognize the concentrations of political power do. And so there was a fundamental understanding that in the same way that in our political sphere, in our government system, we ensure a system of checks and balances, we want to avoid excessive concentration of power in any individual actor or any individual branch, that we should apply a similar set of principles when thinking about our economy. So you rose to prominence the paper about traditional thinking around antitrust law, which is what you’re talking about now. It has allowed big tech to get away with these monopolies. Why were you so interested in this subject? What got you like, I cannot stand these large companies? And you focused on Amazon. You focused on Amazon. But you could apply to all the tech companies. Yeah You could apply to all the tech companies. I actually got my start through reporting and through reporting on all sorts of non-tech industries. So I actually spent several months reporting on agriculture industries, specifically looking at poultry farming, understanding how that industry had become highly concentrated, studying the airline industry, studying copper, steel, and really getting this understanding that there had been the structural shift across our economy towards fewer and fewer dominant firms. So what bothered you? why? No, not this. There’s so many things to say, no, not this at. I think it was the recognition that when firms become so big they really are able to exercise unaccountable and arbitrary power. And at the extreme, they really start functioning as forms of private governments, right? For most people, their everyday interaction with power is not so much with their member of Congress or local representative. It’s really what their employer. It’s really with a business partner. Their boss. Their boss. Exactly. And so ensuring some kind of equitable distributions of power in our economic life is really central to our democracy. And so I started looking at the technology companies because they seemed to be an extension of the dynamics that we were seeing in all of these other industries. But they also seem to be this really elegant example of how this consumer-focused approach to antitrust really renders us blind to all of the ways the big firms can exercise power in really problematic ways. And so I kind of studied Amazon to showcase and tell this broader story of how this consumerist approach to antitrust is really narrow and ignores all of these basic realities. It’s interesting where you pick elegant, because it’s like sort of lawless. I have my own legal theories, as you know, not having gone to law school. I call it the cheap date theory. Is they hand us a dating app or the map or a communications, and then we give away everything to them, and they control all of it. And so we’re cheap dates to all these companies. It’s not a very good reflection on consumers. But we give away a lot for very little even though we think we’re getting a lot. So you wrote this paper in law school. You went to Yale, is that correct? And talk about what you were proposing in trying to shift the traditional thinking about this. So I wrote about how Amazon had become so dominant through relying on a variety of business practices that frankly 50 years ago would have been found to be illegal. It engaged in predatory pricing. So that’s, as you were alluding to when you price a good below cost, it kind of give cheap stuff and luring customers, but then also drive our rivals. And in certain cases, like with diapers, they did that strategy with an explicit goal of driving out a rival. There are documents that the House, Antitrust Subcommittee uncovered where Amazon executives at a pretty high level were saying, hey, this company Diapers.com, it’s our biggest competitor. I think we should take them out. So that was one business strategy — predatory pricing. And then as well as vertical integration. So this is when you kind of expand into different parts of a particular supply chain, so you control every part of the line of business. Also expanding into things like private label, which basically means that you’re the central marketplace for all of these other businesses, but then you’re also competing with those same businesses. And yet you also have access to all of their intimate commercial data. So Amazon has been able to use the data of all of these customers and weaponize that data against them as rivals. So it’s able to really have— its kind of access at scale to a near-perfect market data gives it just unparalleled insight into market trends, market developments. And it’s able to use that information to compete against and oftentimes demote these third party businesses that are dependent on Amazon. So for example, I interviewed the people at Away. They had created a suitcase that got very popular. We’re relatively innovative suitcase. They’ve been around, but they sort of popularized this sort of hard shelled suitcase. And they didn’t want to put their products on Amazon because they were terrified that Amazon would understand this is suddenly going to become a popular item and copy it. But now, even without them being on there, they figured out other hard shell companies and now have an Amazon offering. And they can do that in almost anything and see the signals. So whether it’s hard shelled suitcases, or suddenly everybody wants whatever kombucha. They can look at it and then copy it. That’s exactly right. And I think there are two main issues. One is that Amazon has this unique access to data, right? It’s kind of all of these other businesses are like create a petri dish for Amazon where it’s conducting all these experiments, and then it can kind of unfairly, without actually undertaking the original risk of bringing a product to market, just swoop in and take that reward. Yeah. This looks good. This Looks good. We’ll introduce it. And then hey, well, that suitcase manufacturer that was on page one because everybody’s loved its products, we’ll just move it to page three to page four, and it effectively disappears for users, right? So there’s a variety— Or put an ad on the top and charge a lesser price. Exactly. And these are types of business practices that, again, used to be looked at very unfavorably. We kind of, in many cases, found them to be illegal. And over the last 40 years, judges and enforcers have said, actually, these types of business practices benefit consumers. We’re basically not going to enforce the law against them. So when you wrote your paper, it just hit like an atom bomb in the industry. What were you doing that was different? I think I was questioning the current orthodoxy and whether it had led us astray, and whether it really was equipping us to deal with these digital platforms in particular, which at that point — this is 2017 — were still largely seen as being extremely beneficial for consumers. And I think that was seen as controversial at the time. And why? You were proposing that they look at other things besides harm to consumers, or there was calm to consumers in ways you didn’t see even if you liked what you were getting. Exactly. That there could be long-term harms to consumers. But that also, the antitrust laws were not just about consumer prices. They really needed to look at the structure of the market. They needed to look at power dynamics between these different business entities. They needed to really take into account the long term, right? So if Amazon was structurally amassing so much power, we shouldn’t just assume that a new business would be able to contest that. I mean, I think one thing that the shift in antitrust over the last 40 years has done is that it’s baked in all these assumptions about how markets work that just don’t correspond to reality. They kind of assume that if you have a monopolist that starts abusing its monopoly power, that all of a sudden all of these new businesses will enter and discipline that company, undercut them. And that’s just not the reality. I mean, who’s going to really try to start up an e-commerce marketplace to compete with Amazon in a full-fledged way? And especially as more of their predatory practices are coming to account, be it with Amazon, be it with Facebook, be it with Google, for the fact that they have this near-perfect market intelligence it can use that to cut off any competitor, to buy up that competitor, to introduce replica services. You hear from venture capitalists and investors that this is having a chilling effect. That they’re less likely to invest. It seems like you’re pointing out the— not to say that your work isn’t great, but it’s kind of pointing out the obvious. These people are too big, and you can’t get around them. That’s essentially — I’m going to de-lawyer it for you. But why do you think it caused such a stir? I think the real moment where I started getting a lot more interest was in the summer of 2017 when Amazon bought at Whole Foods. And I think that was — for a lot of people, that was the first moment where they kind of stepped back. And that was close to $14 billion deal. And they just started thinking, what are the scope of Amazon’s ambitions? And is there any point at which we’re going to say, that this company can’t expand, can’t get bigger, can’t get more powerful because we think it’s harmful to our economy our democracy? And I think that Whole Foods transaction I think was a bit of an inflection point in kind of the public thinking about this issue. All right. So your work challenges powerful billionaires that shape our world. And they have gotten through that the Facebook is quite close to the Trump administration. Google was very close to the Obama administration. These are very powerful people. Do you enjoy that — the ability to use your mind in that way to use power? I enjoy it. I know I do but how do you feel about having created this enormous focus on a no to people that never get the word no? [LAUGHS] I mean, it’s been a world wind of a few years, but I think it’s enormously exciting. And I think it’s a growing movement of people who are both recognizing the problem, who are writing about the problem, who want to go into government to solve the problem. And I think it does feel that we’re on the cusp of a turning point. We are at an inflection point. And that we could be seeing transformative change in the coming years. Now people have tried to minimize you by labeling you the leader of the — it’s an incredible thing — “hipster antitrust” movement. What do you think of that term? And what do you say to them? Like, fine. What is your — [LAUGHS] I don’t even know what “hipster antitrust” movement. When I saw it, I was like, oh, very cute. Yeah it was kind of surprised by the name calling. I mean, I think it’s designed to be a pejorative to try and minimize the movement, but I do think that it also suggests that these ideas are powerful and threatening to a lot of very rich people. And so I think it’s inevitable that we’re going to see some tantrums, some backlash. It’s just going to be part of the ride. What are you most scared of in that regard? Is that these companies get — look, through Covid, they’re trillion companies now. The top seven, eight companies are all tech companies, and they’re in the trillion dollar range. The richest people in the world are all tech people, like to an obscene degree. It’s crazy the amount of money they have — the richest people in the history of the world. Warren Buffett’s in there, but he’s lost money this year, you know what I mean? He suffered during Covid, and he’s kind of a piker compared to the rest of these people. Is there a way to resist that? Because this is unheard of wealth, unheard of power, unheard of valuations. Yeah. I mean, I think that’s absolutely right. The challenges are going to be quite significant. But I do think this is an instance where we can draw from history, right? I mean, we’ve lived with tycoons and monopolies controlling industries before. John D. Rockefeller, Vanderbilt, these are people that also controlled swaths of the economy and had enormous political power. And yet we were able to pass laws, to file lawsuits to really ensure that they weren’t able to use that economic power in abusive and destructive ways. So I think this is a moment where we can draw from our history for courage. Do you fear retaliation? I mean, I think, especially as somebody pursuing academic work — I’m in a more secure position, not being dependent on one of these firms directly. But I think it’s something that everybody needs to be vigilant about how these firms are able to use their economic power to target research or ideas that they don’t like. [MUSIC PLAYING] We’ll be right back. If you like what you’re hearing hit subscribe to catch up on episodes you’ve missed and to get each new episode of “Sway” delivered directly to you. More with Lina Khan when we come back. [MUSIC PLAYING] So let’s talk about what you were working on, these congressional hearings in big tech. That’s right. So last March, I joined the House Antitrust Subcommittee. And we launched this investigation into digital markets looking at the power of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. It ended up being a 16-month investigation that spanned seven hearings. Millions of pages of documents that we collected from these companies, hundreds of interviews that we did with other businesses and entrepreneurs in these markets to really understand what is the reality of how business is done with these companies. And is there really competition? Is it possible to enter? Is it possible to compete on a level playing field? What are the effects on consumers? And we, three weeks ago now launched or issued a report with our findings documenting what evidence we had found about how these companies were exercising their power and then also identified a set of recommendations for what Congress should do going forward. All right, so you were interviewing Yelp and Spotify and all kinds of companies that had been affected by — in the case of Spotify, Apple had started a music service and was trying to charge them money they didn’t want to pay. In the case of Facebook, all kinds of different things in social media with Snapchat and others. Sort of give an idea of what you found. So one main takeaway was that these firms now function as gatekeepers over critical channels of distribution, right? And they kind of control key arteries of commerce and communications in the digital age. The second was that in key ways these firms have abused that power. So they’ve abused their control to charge extortionate fees, to impose oppressive contracts. They’ve also use that power to protect their power. So the fact that these firms have near-perfect intelligence through controlling this key infrastructure means that they’ve been able to identify emerging threats, and at key moments either buy up those rivals or squash them, cut them off, copy their services. And then lastly, they’re also using this gatekeeper power to extend their reach into new markets. So the system through things like self-preferencing, through predatory pricing through exclusionary agreements where they’re able to use their existing dominance in ways that privilege them as they try to enter new markets. Such as Amazon going into retail or cars or whatever they’re going into. Exactly. And this is partly because they have so much cash, but it’s also because they’re able to use their dominance to basically extract leverage from business partners in other areas, right? So we would hear from companies that said Amazon isn’t a big competitor and say that the media market. But they’re able to use their dominance in retail to say, hey we’re going to stop selling your products on Amazon.com if you don’t give us an advantage in this other market. And so those types of cross-market benefits I think end up being quite significant. So those were the key factual findings, as well as the fact that these business practices are having a range of harms, right? They’re undermining innovation and entrepreneurship. They’re undermining user privacy. They’re also leading to the degradation of the free and independent press, right, in so far as these firms are barely siphoning off ad revenue from traditional publishers. And that’s also really harming core economic and political liberties. I think one thing that surprised us as investigators was really the prevalence of fear in the market. I mean, you were naming some of the big players that have been a bit more vocal. But there are hundreds, if not thousands, of smaller or mid-sized players that are terrified to start to speak out publicly in any way. In many cases, they were scared to even do confidential interviews because they know that these firms have the ability with the push of a button to really threaten their entire livelihood. One of the things that I remember what I was struck by some of the emails that you got from these companies, which reminded me a lot of Microsoft emails in the old days. Two words that really struck out to me was land grab, meaning we’re going to grab as much as we can, which I can’t believe they typed that into an email, and neutralize. These were Facebook, I think. Explain those emails and what they were trying to get at. Yeah So these were emails that the House Judiciary Committee released when Mark Zuckerberg came to testify because members of Congress wanted to ask him about these emails that we found from high-level Facebook executives talking about how Facebook’s acquisition strategy was basically a land grab to buy up as many assets and kind of lock up the market, and that certain acquisitions such as their purchase of Instagram was an effort to really neutralize these competitive threats, which I think was extremely significant because there’d been a lot of speculation that Facebook bought up Instagram to neutralize the threat, but I don’t think we have seen publicly that type of documentary evidence. So that’s something that the house was able to get from Facebook and made public. So these are small companies they see. Instagram was very small, and it was starting to get popular. And instantly it was off the market. And by the way, Twitter was also looking at buying it. This is what happens that these companies see an opportunity, and they take it. Talk a little bit more of the things you found in this report. I think having studied these companies before, I think I was still surprised by just the huge information advantages they have. I mean, in many cases, they just have such structural information advantages that I think it’s difficult to imagine what fair competition could look like. So one example was we found that Google had used Android as kind of an information collection tool to really track. They had this program called the Lockbox Program. Oh, dear. They called it that? [LAUGHS] Go ahead. Or they were tracking in close detail, which apps were being downloaded; what the usage ratio of those apps were. And this was real-time market intelligence. Facebook had the similar ability to do that through an app company they bought. Yeah. It’s kind of a novel fact pattern for Facebook that we saw. Android was also doing it. Amazon has these capacities. And so when you think about these information collection capacities, and then you think about the scale at which these companies operate, I mean, it really does start to look like near-perfect market intelligence. And I think the companies that are competing with them are really at a structural disadvantage from that perspective. I think, in many instances, these firms have become smarter about what they do and don’t put in emails. But I do think we were able to see Jeff Bezos was saying in email that they were buying up Ring to acquire market position. Yeah. Explain that. Because I was like, what did you just say? Explain what you got him to say. So yeah. The major issue over the last year or two and one the Congress and members of Congress were really worked up about was this idea of Amazon using its third party sellers and their commercial data to identify what goods are popular and then using that data for its own private label for its own first-party products. And this is something that Amazon had vehemently denied even though there was a lot of public reporting. In April, I think it was, The Wall Street Journal published a big piece documenting numerous Amazon employees basically saying, yes, we did this routinely. Our higher ups knew we did this. The House was also able to interview employees, confirming this and further providing evidence. And so when we asked Jeff Bezos about this at the hearing, he basically said, listen, we have a policy in place that’s supposed to prevent employees from doing this, but we can’t insure at this moment that policy has never been violated, which I think was a bit of an— They’re peeking. They’re peeking, right? That’s really — They’re peeking under the hood. Yeah, exactly. And I think several members found that quite underwhelming an answer. I mean this is a C.E.O. of one of those powerful companies in the world, the richest man in the world. And the fact that he couldn’t account for this pretty basic fact that there had been enormous amount of attention on I think raised basic questions about whether his company was too big to manage, or whether he was being deliberately evasive. So oops was not good enough for you. Oops. [LAUGHS] How did I see that? How did I look in the diary over there kind of thing? It was a weird response, I thought. But it’s too irresistible in lots of ways not to avail yourself to the information you have right in front of you and take a shortcut, really. I think that’s a really excellent point. And I think it raises a basic question about whether we can rely on these companies to self-police. And I think your point is that, no, we can’t. We really need to, I think, address the underlying incentive that they have to access the information in the first place and use this information in these ways, which is why the report recommended things like structural separations and line of business restrictions that would limit these firms from being able to collect and use that information in the first place. This is your first time working in a congressional setting. What was that like? I learned an enormous amount of from Congress. I mean, I think that the reason I really went over — one major reason I went over was because Congress used to be a really active player in antitrust, right? Through the ‘50s and ‘60s, Congress used to do these types of deep dives into corporate power, and do these deep studies understanding how were these dominant businesses potentially abusing their power. They’d call in the C.E.O.s. They’d do these hundreds of interviews and really create these multi-volume records that, I think, were enormously helpful both for — We’re watching you. That we’re watching you. The we’re watching you. The oversight, the Congressional oversight of these enormously powerful people in our economy and our democracy. And then also had the effect of pressuring enforcers, right? Creating this ambient pressure to enforcers that Congress is finding wrongdoing. If you kind of look over to the agencies, and they’re just kind of sitting on their hands, it kind of raises the question of what are you really doing with your time? So I think those benefits of investigations were really top of mind when I got the offer to go join and kind of helped revive this tradition that Congress has not really pursued and in recent years. Chairman Cicilline, he said this was the most significant congressional investigation of corporate power done in 50 years. What has been lost in that push-pull of Congress, the agencies, et cetera? Because it’s not a fresh thing in the Trump administration, even though Trump has cut regulations and such. But this is not a new thing. This goes back. I think that’s absolutely right. And one of the findings of the House report was that there has been failure by both the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. I mean, Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple made over 500 acquisitions. Only a handful were even seriously looked at. Of Facebook’s acquisitions, the F.T.C. only really investigated the Instagram one. And even that, with the emails that you’ve now seen, they allowed it to go through. So I do think we’re kind of looking at multi-decade institutional failure that has variety of factors and causes, but I do think there needs to be a bit of a moment of reckoning and renewal at the agencies to kind of do more. You’re young. You get tech. You’ve been steeped in this, as I have been covering it for decades. Now, do you think congressional representatives understand tech? Because that’s sort of the image during the Zuckerberg hearing when they were asking him how to fix their Facebook, essentially. It looked ridiculous. From a public point of view, it looks ridiculous in a lot of. cases. And in your hearing, it looked that people were pretty up to speed on what’s happening here, got the basics of power. I think that’s absolutely right. I think there’s been an enormous amount of learning over the last few years. And you have committees of jurisdictions. So our committee specifically is on antitrust, and members have been doing this investigation for over a year by the time we invited those C.E.O.s. We deliberately timed it that way to make sure we had the information; we had the documents; we had the evidence. The members of Congress had time to kind of study that evidence. And I think you’re absolutely right. I do think their questions reveal the level of sophistication that it seems to people by surprise. Maybe even took some of the executives by surprise. Questions about ad tech or specific acquisitions, the intricacies of how certain markets work— I think these are all things that members of Congress are definitely much more fluent in. And frankly, at the end of the day, they’re the ones with legislative authority. All right, well, let’s talk about the bipartisanship because you did have representative Jordan going down a conservative bias highway, which they love to go down without any kind of proof. How do you deal with that because it’s become so politicized? You feel it’s a bipartisan effort? Because you can have a bipartisan effort, and two people think they should regulate them for different reasons. You’ve got the president putting out these executive orders that are, I think, written by a 12-year-old. I don’t understand. They don’t make any sense. And my problem with that is that you have only so many shots of these people. And if you do a crappy shot, you’re never getting it again. You’re right that when it came to recommendations, there was some disagreement. I think what was significant was A, that the investigation at its inception was bipartisan. So when you sent these document requests to Jeff Bezos, to Mark Zuckerberg, they had the signatures of not just the Democratic members, but also the Republican. And I think that was quite important from to kind of require these companies to take this investigation seriously in the first place. I do think, though, that the report that the member representative Buck wrote and had the signature of the other Republicans on— that report basically said that it agreed with the vast majority of the findings of the majority, which is quite significant when you think about what our findings was with regards to the monopolistic control these firms enjoy. There were several recommendations that they said they agreed with that included things like increasing funding for the agencies. There were several recommendations they said they were open to learning more about, such as shifting the presumption in merger enforcement, which basically would say that the government no longer had the burden of proof. It would be the companies, which sounds like a technical legal thing. But I think, for practical purposes, it has a huge deal. And there were certain other areas of antitrust reform that would have a huge impact that they were if not onboard with, then certainly open to. I think that’s in an enormous and remarkable degree of agreement, I would say. The areas where they disagreed was with things like structural separations, line of business restrictions, as well as some of the recommendations to strengthen what are known as private rights of action. So this is the ability of private parties to sue, which was historically a really important part of the antitrust laws, right? Congress recognized that if the only people that you give power to enforce the antitrust laws or public regulators, there’s going to be a good chance that they’re going to get captured by the very monopolies they’re supposed to oversee. And so that’s why you need to give — Lobbyists is you’re saying. Lobbyists, right. You need to give everyday people, the people who are hurt by this monopoly power, the ability to also file lawsuits. So when you look at this report — you finish this report. Then you’ve now gone to Columbia Law School. I mean, you’re teaching there. What do you hope to have happen? Are you hopeful that this hearing will lead to new legislation? I am hopeful. I mean, I think, practically speaking, the next step is going to be that there would have to be a markup where the committee adopts this report formally and adopts its findings and recommendations. But I think where we’re going to start seeing bills be introduced. I mean, I think we going to very quickly see — Individual bills on lots of issues. Exactly. I think there’s going to be a discussion among the caucus, among members to figure out what approach do they want to take. But I think there is an immense amount of interest among members on this subcommittee, but also more broadly across Congress to start legislating. If you could wave a wand — you’re ahead of the internet — what would you want? What do you think the most critical ones are? Breakup? Or you have my most interesting moment I think this year is when Zuckerberg called Elizabeth Warren his existential threat. And I think I texted him. I was like, not climate change? Not a meteor hurtling towards us? Not death, you know what I mean? There’s so many existential crises in this world. But there she is. There she is. But what do you think the most important — if you had to pick two or three things that have to happen to get this started, what would you say they are? I think the structural breakups are going to be really important. I think one of the main findings of the report was how these firms have been able to leverage their monopoly into all of these other areas. And I think unless you put a very clear stop to that, it’s going to be an increasingly difficult problem to solve. I also think we need to rehabilitate the antitrust laws. They’re just decades of judicial precedent of really bad court opinions that have extremely narrowed what these laws are supposed to be about. And I think if Congress was able to override a lot of that case law, it would just re-empower both the antitrust agencies, but also a lot of private parties to start bringing these cases. So what would be the key changes? So I think one key change is to monopolization law to basically make it undo a lot of the hurdles that the courts have introduced. I think with regards to mergers, we do need to basically shift the burden of proof, especially when you have dominant firms acquiring smaller companies or going on these wholesale buying sprees. I do think the presumption to be in certain cases that those acquisitions are anti-competitive unless proven otherwise. So that they have to prove why they should be able to buy it versus the government proving why they should— What are benefits of this purchase? And then also what is preventing you from entering this market through internal growth? I mean, the fact that these firms have acquired a vast majority of their technologies, I think, does in some cases undercut the view — It’s common. — yeah. That they’re kind of there at the fountain of all this innovation. It’s like, no, in many cases, you’ve actually bought out this innovation that others created. And in some cases, you did so to prevent it from dislodging your own monopoly position. The words they have are fascinating. I love lockbox. I mean, literally, they pull from the evil people’s handbook. But one of my favorite is killer acquisition. Explain what that is because you talked about it in the report. Yeah. So a killer acquisition is when these firms acquire a company for the purpose of shutting it down, for the purpose of killing it because they recognize that a product could be a threat to them. So that’s something that the report identifies that Facebook did in several cases. But it’s something that we’ve seen across these firms. They brag about it. They brag about doing that in Silicon Valley. It’s amazing. I was sort of like, you’re buying it so you could end it, so that they don’t — I mean, it’s really quite out in the open. That’s the thing is what’s really interesting about all this is they don’t hide from it what they’re doing. They revel in it. In fact, other small startups want to be acquired this way, or create a product they know will be killed, essentially. And VCs want this to happen. Yeah. I think that sense of impunity is something that we see across the board. Yeah. They don’t think you can touch them. I don’t think sort of this evil rub your hands now we’ve got them kind of thing. They just feel like this is the way it should be, and you’re in their way in terms of innovation. Don’t get in our way, government, because we’re creating jobs. We’re creating this. We’re creating that. And we know better, essentially. So when you’re thinking about a breakup, what would be— for each of these companies, would you mind giving me one for each of them? Google? I think with Google, there are a lot of conflicts across its business, and one area is in the ad tech market, which is a very technical area of its business. This is something that representative Jayapal spoke about at our hearing. Basically, Google controls the exchange where digital ads are bought and sold. But it also has a position on both sides of the market. So it both sells and buys and controls the underlying exchange. And the technology. And the underlying technology, exactly. And breakups to eliminate those conflicts of interest are going to be really important. I think with some of the other firms, there’s a big conversation around whether a Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were anti-competitive. And if so, whether those should be unwound as part of this broader strategy to monopolize the market. But Lina, they changed the name to Instagram by Facebook. You can do that now. [LAUGHS] But in the report there was interviewed a former employee that was actually trying to rebut the idea that it would be so complicated to break up Instagram. It’s Facebook. They were like, it’s code. It’s a bunch of numbers. You can just move them from this column to that column. So I think it’s true that in some cases, there may be certain types of issues that need to be thought through, but I think the reflex response is, oh, this is just so complicated — It’s too hard. — I can’t do it. And I think we need to move past that a bit. Let me give you a tip, Lina. It’s always really hard when it’s something they don’t want to do. It’s super easy and trivial when it’s something they want to do. They’re the smartest people on Earth when they want to be. All right, Apple and Amazon. I’d love to hear from you on that. So I don’t think breakups is going to be the answer in every case. I think with Apple, we need to think through — in any given day any app developer can be delisted. And so those types of I think inequalities of bargaining power need to be addressed. With Amazon, I think there are a variety of conflicts. One major one that the report found was between its third party retail business and its first party retail business. So Amazon both is a platform for all of these other sellers, but also sell its own products on it both private label but also wholesale goods that it buys. And I think there’s a real question about whether that creates a conflict of interest that needs to be addressed. The report also found that in certain cases Amazon — what’s known as ties its fulfillment and logistics services to the platform so that in certain cases, you can only win the buy box as a merchant if you’re also buying Amazon’s logistics and fulfillment services. So I think that’s another potential conflict that could be addressed. That’s important. That’s a very important thing that people don’t realize. You have to use their things. And if they buy a UPS or something like that, which has been rumored, that they could really have every single aspect of the transaction in their corner, and they’re under their control between them. That’s right. And the report actually quoted merchants that said we’re forced to use Amazon’s logistic services not because it’s the best thing out there, but because if we don’t use it, we don’t have a shot at the buy box. And we had a couple say that the only negative reviews I ever get — or the main negative reviews I’ve gotten from the times when I use Amazon services. So this suggests that it really is a form of coercion that merchants feel compelled to use these services in certain cases. Your expertise is not Section 230, which protects internet company. It protects a lot of things. It’s a very complex law that was passed many decades ago. They have brought immunity in ways other industries don’t. Is that going to get in the way of this kind of regulation and actions that you’ve been proposing? I think these are fairly discrete issues. I mean, I think there are areas of overlap, but I don’t think that the 230 immunity is going to impede antitrust actions or push us for new legislation. I think these are separate issues in that sense. So when you think about the impact you’ve had, five years hence, what would you like to see? How does innovation live? I think if we have rules of the road that are protecting innovation and encouraging innovation, that’s going to have to come from renewed antitrust laws from lawsuits that penalize monopolies that try to crush competitors, that try to crush new entrants. And I think that’s going to be the path to ensure that the next wave of Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apples are also able to emerge and are not just going to be crushed in the crib but by the current giants. When we started today, you were on Firefox. And you had to download Chrome for this. You don’t have Chrome, which is a Google product. That’s right. I don’t use Chrome. I’m the same way. I don’t like Chrome, and it’s here on my computer. I don’t want Google. And I was married to a Google person. I was like, get all Google products off my computer. What can individual people do? Give some people some tips for in this monopoly group? What do you think average citizens should be doing in this case, or thinking about? I think they should be organizing for political change and for legislative change. I mean, I do think this is an area where there’s often a temptation to push for consumer boycotts. But I do think that kind of gets us into a confused place because in many cases, these are emerging to be infrastructure, right? We don’t ask people to boycott highways to make them safer. We don’t ask people to boycott core services because we’re so dependent on them. I mean, I think these are questions that we need to encounter not as consumers but as political citizens given that I do think the reforms need to be legislative and come from government.

Lawmakers are interrogating tech C.E.O.s on Capitol Hill while the Justice Department pursues a landmark antitrust case against Google. For decades, tech giants have avoided such scrutiny — hiding behind the idea that their products are free, beneficial, even beloved. Lina Khan says this is no excuse for a monopoly. As a 28-year-old law student, Ms. Khan published a single scholarly article that greatly shifted America’s antitrust debate. Three years later, she remains an existential threat to companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple. Ms. Khan served as counsel to the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee in this summer’s investigation, helping expose how Silicon Valley’s most revered companies use data and power to undercut, threaten and swallow up their competition. In this episode of “Sway,” she tells Kara Swisher that Big Tech’s practices have had a “chilling effect” on the American economy, and that it’s time to drag the nation’s antitrust thinking out of the “ice age.” Times Opinion is teaming up with Kara Swisher on a new podcast about power and influence. She’s taking on chief executives, senators, actors and activists — plus upstarts and gatekeepers you might not yet know but need to hear from. How did these people get power? How do they actually use it? And how does their power shape your life? Every Monday and Thursday, from New York Times Opinion.
