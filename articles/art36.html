Biden Jr.’s running mate. She gained considerable experience as a debater during the Democratic primary season and also has a record as an aggressive questioner in Senate hearings. Her goal will be to keep the focus on Mr. Trump’s performance while also defending Mr. Biden’s long record and the positions he has taken in this campaign. Other topics likely to come up include the state of the economy and Mr. Trump’s decision to halt negotiations for another stimulus package; the battle over Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett; racial tensions, police violence and threats from white supremacists, and a variety of national security issues including the rise of China and Russia’s election meddling. A team of reporters from The New York Times is fact-checking the debate, providing analysis and context. By Ana Swanson — Ms. Harris Economic estimates of job losses resulting from the president’s trade war with China vary but a September 2019 report by Moody’s Analytics estimated the trade fight had already cut overall American employment by 300,000 jobs and reduced economic output by 0.3 percentage points. Farmer bankruptcies have risen during the trade war, which prompted China to impose retaliatory tariffs on American soybeans, pork and other agricultural products. But the U.S. is not in a manufacturing recession, which is commonly defined as output shrinking for two consecutive quarters. Factory output was sluggish through 2019 in part as a result of the trade war and plummeted with the pandemic but has been recovering since April.  By Coral Davenport — Mr. Pence While it is true that the United States’ carbon dioxide emissions have declined by more than 10 percent in the past decade, more than a dozen other countries — including most of the European Union — have seen declines of more than twice that. Carbon emissions in the United States have declined in part recently because of the recession and collapse of a coal industry that the Trump administration tried to protect. But U.S. carbon dioxide emissions are on track to begin increasing in the coming years, in part because of the Trump administration’s rollbacks of regulations on carbon dioxide pollution. By Linda Qiu — Mr. Pence This was a reference to a series of questions Ms. Harris asked Judge Brian Buescher in 2018 during hearings on his nomination to a federal District Court seat about his membership in the Knights of Columbus, an organization of Catholic men. She did not say explicitly that his membership in the organization was disqualifying, but did ask whether Judge Beuscher was aware that the Knights of Columbus opposed same-sex marriage and abortion, and whether he held those views. Some religious groups and Republican senators accused Ms. Harris of exhibiting anti-Catholic bias with the questions. By Jim Tankersley — Ms. Harris Mr. Biden’s stated campaign plan proposes to repeal some, but not all, of the tax cuts Mr. Trump signed into law in 2017. The House and Senate would have to pass new tax legislation to accomplish that. By Mike Baker — Mr. Pence Mr. Pence sought to blame the Obama administration for the challenges in responding to this year’s coronavirus pandemic, citing an “empty” Strategic National Stockpile. The stockpile was far from empty. It is true that the stockpile, which includes supplies for responding to a range of national health disasters, was short of enough equipment such as masks to meet surging demand during the opening months of the pandemic. Greg Burel, who was the director of the stockpile until this year, told CBS News this year that the stockpile had not received funds to replace masks and other equipment that were used in response to the 2009 swine flu pandemic. But Mr. Burel had said last year that the stockpile was an “$8 billion enterprise” that had undergone “a dramatic expansion of the scope” of its capabilities. A Washington Post reporter who visited one of the stockpile sites in 2018 described a massive warehouse with “hundreds of thousands of shrink-wrapped boxes of medicines” stacked nearly five stories high. And while Mr. Pence points to the actions of the prior White House administration, his administration had three years to make investments to build out the stockpile. That didn’t happen. By Linda Qiu — Mr. Pence Mr. Pence made a very precise and therefore accurate claim. But it’s worth noting that these metrics do not fully capture the complex beliefs of a lawmaker. Newsweek was referring to analysis from GovTrack, a service that monitors Congress. The website ranked Ms. Harris as the most liberal senator of 2019, based on each lawmaker’s patterns of serving as a co-sponsor of legislation. But it rated Mr. Sanders as more liberal than Ms. Harris in 2017, 2018 and 2020 so far. Joshua Tauber, GovTrack’s founder, also told The Times that “we’d be the first to disavow our analysis as proof that Senator Harris is radical.” He noted that the rankings reflect just one aspect of a lawmaker’s job and do not capture the complex views an individual could hold so “our analysis does not reflect the totality of Harris’s political views.” DW-Nominate, an ideological position tracker based on votes, rated Ms. Harris as more liberal than Mr. Sanders but less liberal than Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in the 2017 to 2019 legislative session. Scoring by ideological groups also support Mr. Pence’s assertion. Mr. Sanders earned a higher lifetime score from the American Conservative Union than Ms. Harris, based on how their votes and positions align with conservative positions. Conversely, Ms. Harris received a higher score from Progressive Punch than Mr. Sanders. By Abby Goodnough — Mr. Pence President Trump’s physician, Dr. Sean P. Conley, has repeatedly declined to answer several important questions about his illness, including when Mr. Trump had his last negative test for the coronavirus and his first positive one. Dr. Conley also initially refused to say whether the president had received supplemental oxygen. It was only on Sunday, two nights after Mr. Trump arrived at the hospital, that Dr. Conley acknowledged Mr. Trump had a high fever and that his oxygen level dropped on Friday morning, before he was taken by helicopter to Walter Reed. Dr. Conley has also not revealed anything about the condition of Mr. Trump’s lungs, though the president’s oxygen levels had dropped to a level that can indicate that a patient’s lungs are compromised. By Alan Rappeport — Mr. Pence According to the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, the typical family of four received a $2,000 tax cut in 2018, the first year that Mr. Trump’s tax cut was in effect. However, the statement is misleading because it suggests that the tax cuts were spread equitably across the country. The bulk of the tax cuts benefited the highest earners. Moreover, many of the individual tax cuts will expire in 2025 unless they are extended.  By Jeanna Smialek — Mr. Pence It is true that the economy has added back a lot of jobs since the depths of the pandemic, regaining about 11.4 million of the 22 million jobs it lost between February and April. But that rebound had relatively little to do with Mr. Trump’s policies. People came back to work quickly because they had been temporarily furloughed as states and cities shut down amid the virus, and businesses brought workers back to their jobs as they reopened. The government’s Paycheck Protection Program — which offered forgivable loans to small businesses that retained employees — helped, and payments to households supported consumer spending and may have prevented deeper recession dynamics from taking hold.  By Katherine J. Wu — Mr. Pence In 2009, the H1N1 flu virus infected about 60 million Americans and killed an estimated 12,500 people. Mr. Pence suggests that 2 million would have died if this strain of flu were as deadly as the coronavirus — 160 times the actual death toll. There’s not enough data to support the vice president’s statement, and it’s unclear how he arrived at these figures. Mr. Pence may be extrapolating from current estimates of the global burden of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 36 million people around the world and killed more than 1 million. Roughly doubled, these statistics could arrive at about 2 million deaths among 60 million infections. But experts have repeatedly stressed that it is extremely difficult to calculate the death rate linked to a new pathogen like the coronavirus during an ongoing outbreak — especially one as vast, fast-moving and geographically far-reaching as the Covid-19 pandemic. Researchers are still unsure what proportion of coronavirus infections are without symptoms; without adequate testing, these individuals are difficult to pinpoint and factor into case counts. And it is also difficult to tabulate deaths. What has been so far, however, is that the coronavirus is more deadly and more contagious than typical seasonal flu viruses, which tend to kill around 0.1 percent of the people they infect. By Ana Swanson — Mr. Pence Mr. Biden has described the tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed on more than $360 billion of Chinese products in the course of the trade war as erratic and self-defeating, and has called for more targeted measures against China, but he has not publicly committed to repealing all of the tariffs. Mr. Biden actually appears reluctant to commit either way to fully keeping or eliminating the tariffs, and his aides have said that he plans to evaluate the tariffs once in office based on their impact on the American middle class. By Noah Weiland — Mr. Pence Through its expedited vaccine development program, Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration is already funding the manufacturing of millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines, and has contracts with five drugmakers that have vaccine candidates in late-stage trials. But just one of the five — Pfizer — has said that it could have initial results this month, and the Food and Drug Administration this week published guidelines for evaluating emergency authorizations that detailed why it could take at least several more months for a company to clear the bar. Dr. Anthony Fauci and other top health officials have said that evidence of a vaccine’s effectiveness could be available by November or December. If every aspect of the vaccines’ development and distribution goes exactly as planned, certain people in high-risk groups, including frontline health workers, could get vaccinated this year. By Coral Davenport — Mr. Pence Mr. Biden’s climate change plan would end new leases for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for oil and gas on federal lands, but it does not ban existing fracking on public lands or new or existing fracking on private land. By Michael Crowley — Ms. Harris Ms. Harris appeared to be referring to a passage from Bob Woodward’s recent book, “Rage,” which recounts a Jan. 28 White House meeting at which President Trump’s national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, told Mr. Trump that the coronavirus “will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency.” During the same meeting, Mr. Woodward reported, Mr. O’Brien’s deputy, Matthew Pottinger, told Mr. Trump that the virus might rival the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide. Mr. Trump did not relay such alarms to the public. “Hopefully it won’t be as bad as some people think it could be,” he said two days later, according to an Associated Press timeline. “We think we have it very well under control.” “This is deadly stuff,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with Mr. Woodward a week later. “You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed,” he said adding: “It’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flus.” Three days later, Mr. Trump again downplayed the virus, telling supporters: “I think the virus is going to be — it’s going to be fine.” And on Fox News he said, We’re in very good shape. We have 11 cases. And most of them are getting better very rapidly. I think they will all be better.” As for Mr. Pence, even on Feb. 27 he assured reporters at a White House briefing that “the threat to the American public remains low of a spread of the coronavirus.” By Jim Tankersley — Ms. Harris There are a range of estimates by independent economists for how much Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts were projected to add to federal budget deficits over the course of a decade. Some of them are in the neighborhood of $2 trillion, including projections from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. By Jim Tankersley — Ms. Harris In a story drawing on several years of Mr. Trump’s tax returns, The New York Times reported last month that Mr. Trump “is personally responsible for loans and other debts totaling $421 million, with most of it coming due within four years.” By Sheryl Gay Stolberg — Mr. Pence Mr. Pence was referring to a gathering at the White House on Sept. 26, when Mr. Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, an event that appears to have produced a cluster of coronavirus infections at the highest levels of the administration. Mr. Trump formally announced the nomination in the Rose Garden, where many of the attendees flouted the recommendations of public health experts by not wearing masks or social distancing. But there was also a private reception indoors, where photos show attendees mingling in close quarters without wearing masks. It is impossible to say which of those events was responsible for the virus’s spread, but the day’s festivities were not all outside. By Linda Qiu — Mr. Pence Mr. Pence was quoting Ron Klain, once Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s chief of staff, who was the Obama administration’s Ebola response coordinator. Mr. Klain, asked at an event last year about vaccine development and whether the Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies was equipped to deal with a flu outbreak, said that “we did every possible thing wrong,” adding that it was “purely a fortuity that this wasn’t one of the great mass casualty events in American history.” But Mr. Klain said this year that his comments solely addressed the difficulties in producing a vaccine for the H1N1 virus, which caused the outbreak. Mr. Klain fact-checked the vice president on his own: Thanks for mentioning me @vp, so here are the facts: 14,000 died from H1N1; we are headed to 400,000 dead in less than a year from COVID. Happy to compare records any time! By Linda Qiu — Mr. Pence Mr. Trump did not ban all travel from China, nor did Mr. Biden call his executive order restricting travel xenophobic. The travel restrictions, put in place on Jan. 31, only applied to foreign citizens and included exceptions, ultimately allowing 40,000 people to travel from China to the United States from the end of January to April. Mr. Biden has generally criticized Mr. Trump for “xenophobia” and “fear-mongering” in his response to the coronavirus. (Mr. Trump has used the phrase “Chinese virus” in describing the outbreak.) But The Times was unable to find an instance of him using those words to describe the restrictions specifically. In April, the Biden campaign said that Mr. Biden supported the restrictions, as they had the backing of scientists and public health officials. By Linda Qiu — Ms. Harris Ms. Harris is taking Mr. Trump’s comments out of context. He was speaking about the Democrats’ criticism of his administration’s response to the pandemic and comparing it to the “impeachment hoax,” not the virus itself. “Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue,” Mr. Trump said at a February rally in South Carolina. “They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning, they lost, it’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax,” he continued.
