India’s crisis is now spreading to the hinterlands along its southern coastline. RIGHT NOW Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, underwent outpatient surgery on Thursday morning to remove a polyp from his vocal cord, and is now resting at home. In a brief text exchange, Dr. Fauci said he underwent general anesthesia and is “doing fine.” The state of Florida reached a grim threshold on Thursday as its death toll from the coronavirus exceeded 10,000 people, according to a New York Times database. Florida is the fifth state to report 10,000 or more deaths. The others are New York, New Jersey, California and Texas. It was a widely expected inflection point. Florida, as of Thursday morning, had identified more than 588,000 cases, and while the number of new cases per day has declined since mid-July, the state is still identifying more than 4,700 new cases per day, on average, in the last seven-day period ending Wednesday. Public and private-sector efforts to navigate the continuing crisis have been closely scrutinized in the United States’s third most-populous state, where a quarter of the state’s population of more than 21 million is older than 60. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, was criticized for waiting until April 1 to issue a statewide stay-at-home order, after many states had done so. Disney World opened to visitors in July, but the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville was canceled. And last week, more than a dozen counties reopened their schools in accordance with a statewide order for all schools to offer in-person instruction by the end of the month. The state’s most populous county, Miami-Dade, has suffered the largest number of cases, with 1 in 18 people testing positive. Mr. DeSantis has stressed that the state’s virus crisis is largely limited to the very old. But the disease appears to be taking a relatively small but increasing toll on the young: More Floridians in the 25-44 age group died in July than had died in the previous four months of the pandemic combined, a review of Florida Department of Health data shows. Records also show the people who died from the virus in Florida among the young were disproportionately Black. Nationwide, the pandemic has killed so many Americans that the patterns of death in nearly every state look aberrant when compared to recent history. Nationwide, 223,900 more people have died than usual from March 15 to Aug. 8, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates. School nurses were already in short supply in the United States, with less than 40 percent of schools employing one full-time before the pandemic. Now those overburdened health care specialists are finding themselves on the front lines of a risky, high-stakes experiment in protecting public health as districts reopen their doors amid spiking caseloads in many parts of the country. The American Association of Pediatrics recommends that every school have a nurse on site. But before the outbreak, according to the National Association of School Nurses, a quarter of American schools did not have one at all. And there has been no national effort to provide districts with new resources for hiring them, although some states have tapped federal relief funds. Washington State is one of the places where nurses are a rarity in school hallways, with only 7 percent of schools employing one full-time, and nearly 30 percent of districts having one available for six hours or less per week. As the lone nurse for her school district in central Washington State, Janna Benzel will monitor 1,800 students for virus symptoms when classrooms open later this month, on top of her normal responsibilities like managing allergies, distributing medications and writing hundreds of immunization plans. “I’ll have to go to these schools and assess every sniffle and sneeze that could potentially be a positive case,” she said. “I just don’t know if I can do it alone.” In some places, administrators have been scrambling to get more nurses into schools before the academic year. New York City, the nation’s largest district and one of the few big cities in the country still planning to physically reopen its schools on the first day back, went on a hiring spree after the city’s powerful teachers’ union said their members should not return to classrooms without a nurse in each of the city’s roughly 1,300 school buildings. Mayor Bill de Blasio said last week that the city had finally secured enough nurses to fulfill that demand, less than a month before the scheduled start of in-person instruction. “It’s weird that it takes a pandemic for people to be like, ‘Oh look at that, what you do is useful,’” said Tara Norvez, a school nurse in Queens. Ms. Norvez said that she is looking forward to the start of the school year, as long as there is enough personal protective gear and other safety measures in place. Nursing home residents make up just 1.2 percent of the U.S. population, but they account for about 40 percent of Covid-19 deaths. But when the virus crept into Heartland Health Care Center in Moline, Ill., on the last day of July, the nursing home was not defenseless. Heartland was the first facility to participate in a large clinical trial of a drug that might protect residents from the infection in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Drug companies and the federal government often avoid testing drugs in older people, even if they are the ones who need treatment most. The elderly may have a range of complicating conditions that make it difficult to tell if the drug is working, and nursing home and extended care facilities are governed by a raft of complex regulations regarding privacy and access. Experts say the new research, sponsored by Eli Lilly and the National Institutes of Health, is among the first large clinical trials to involve nursing home residents. And the scientists are delighted. “These patients are so underserved,” said Dr. Rebecca Boxer, medical director of clinical trials at the Kaiser Permanente’s Institute for Health Research in Colorado. “They do not get access to innovative new drugs and trials.” The experimental drug is a monoclonal antibody, an artificially synthesized version of coronavirus antibodies produced by the body. In this case, the antibody was “cloned” from those found in the blood of a Seattle man, one of the first patients to survive Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Monoclonal antibodies are one of the great hopes in the war on the coronavirus. They already serve as the basis for effective treatments for arthritis, cancer, lupus — even Ebola. They are difficult to manufacture, however, and expensive. Still, two companies, Regeneron and Eli Lilly, have forged ahead with clinical trials. The trial in nursing homes is pivotal to Eli Lilly’s effort to determine whether its version can stop the coronavirus. U.S. ROUNDUP About 1.1 million American workers filed state jobless claims last week, the Labor Department said on Thursday, an increase after two weeks of declines and a reminder that the labor market remains fragile five months into the pandemic. “We won’t see a renewal of hiring until the pandemic is under much better control,” said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago. “We have made substantial and rapid improvement in the last three months, but improvement from here will prove slower and more difficult.” There were 543,000 new claims last week for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a separate program aimed at self-employed people, gig workers and others not covered by traditional unemployment benefits. The crosscurrents in the economy are striking. The unemployment rate remains dangerously high at 10.2 percent, and sectors like leisure and hospitality are experiencing huge losses in employment. Hotels and airports are nearly empty and many restaurants remain closed. But home building is booming and retail sales are back to levels that preceded the pandemic. The stock market is hitting record highs. And economists warn that conditions could easily deteriorate if Washington doesn’t offer more support. Republicans and Democrats have been unable to agree on a new coronavirus relief package to augment the CARES Act, passed in March. A $600 weekly federal supplement to state unemployment insurance expired at the end of last month, and a $300-a-week replacement engineered by President Trump is having trouble getting off the ground, with only 11 states so far participating. “Federal support is crucial to underpinning the virtuous cycle we’ve had,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays. “The longer negotiations stall, the more likely there will be a hiccup in spending.” Elsewhere in the United States: A survey of nearly 2,200 members of the largest federal employee’s union found that more than 70 percent of those who have returned to on-site work felt their agencies were not keeping them safe. The report, which was prepared by the union and released Wednesday, comes as many federal agencies have begun directing employees who had been working remotely at the beginning of the pandemic to return to offices. Only 56.2 percent of those surveyed said their employers had provided adequate personal protective equipment. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, underwent outpatient surgery on Thursday morning to remove a polyp from his vocal cord, and is now resting at home. In a brief text exchange, Dr. Fauci said he underwent general anesthesia and is “doing fine.” Dr. Fauci’s voice had been showing notable strain in recent months — in part, he has surmised, because he was doing so much talking — but he had been putting off treatment because of his busy schedule. TRANSCRIPT “Hey, everybody, it’s me, Kamala.” “Tonight we are going to hear from so many phenomenal women who are working to help us build that more perfect union.” “Tonight I’m thinking of the girls and boys who see themselves in America’s future because of Kamala Harris — a black woman, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, and our nominee for vice president. This is our country’s story: breaking down barriers and expanding the circle of possibility.” ♫ “I’m in love with my future, and you don’t know ...” ♫ “Donald Trump’s ignorance and incompetence have always been a danger to our country. Covid-19 was Trump’s biggest test. He failed miserably. Today America has the most Covid deaths in the world and an economic collapse.” “My mom worked hard and paid taxes, and the Obama administration told her she could stay. My dad thought you would protect military families. So he voted for you in 2016, Mr. President. He says he won’t vote for you again after what you did to our family.” “The wife of a U.S. Marine veteran was deported to Mexico.” “Instead of protecting us, you tore our world apart.” “My mom is a good person, and she’s not a criminal.” “Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job, because he can’t. And the consequences of that failure are severe: 170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone, while those at the top take in more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before. But more than anything, what I know about Joe, what I know about Kamala, is that they actually care about every American, and that they care deeply about this democracy. They believe that in a democracy, the right to vote is sacred, and we should be making it easier for people to cast their ballots, not harder. They understand that in this democracy, the commander in chief does not use the men and women of our military, who are willing to risk everything to protect our nation, as political props to deploy against peaceful protesters on our own soil. This president and those in power, those who benefit from keeping things the way they are, they are counting on your cynicism. They know they can’t win you over with their policies. So they’re hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote does not matter.” “With only one nomination received and pursuant to our rules, I hereby declare that Kamala Harris is elected as the Democratic candidate for vice president.” “She is the first black woman, first South Asian woman to be named on the Democratic ticket.” “This is a historic pick.” “Someone who looks like us on a presidential ticket, that’s crazy.” “That I am here tonight is a testament to the dedication of generations before me: women and men who believed so fiercely in the promise of equality, liberty and justice for all. This week marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment. And we celebrate the women who fought for that right. Yet so many of the Black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting long after its ratification. But they were undeterred. Without fanfare or recognition, they organized and testified and rallied and marched and fought, not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table. My mother taught me that service to others gives life purpose and meaning. And oh, how I wish she were here tonight, but I know she’s looking down on me from above. I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman, all of five feet tall, who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, Calif. On that day she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now and speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America. Make no mistake: The road ahead is not easy. We may stumble. We may fall short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly and deal with our challenges honestly. We will speak truths, and we will act with the same faith in you that we ask you to place in us. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.” [music and applause] Senator Kamala Harris of California, who was formally nominated for the vice presidency on Wednesday, was among the Democratic leaders who sharply criticized President Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic during the third night of their party’s national convention. Ms. Harris, who became the first woman of color on a major party’s ticket, said that Mr. Trump’s “failure of leadership has cost lives and livelihoods.” “If you are a parent struggling with your child’s remote learning, or you are a teacher, struggling on the other side of that screen, you know what we’re doing right now is not working,” she added. The night also featured a striking repudiation of Mr. Trump by former President Barack Obama, a break with the presidential custom of not criticizing a successor by name. “Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job, because he can’t,” Mr. Obama said, growing emotional at points as he talked about the challenges facing the country and democracy. “The consequences of that failure are severe. 170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone.” Mr. Obama also said Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Ms. Harris understand that “our ability to work together to solve big problems like a pandemic depends on a fidelity to facts and science and logic, and not just making stuff up.” Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said that the coronavirus crisis was “on Donald Trump and the Republicans who enable him,” and that his administration would be held accountable in the November election. “Covid-19 was Trump’s biggest test,” Ms. Warren said. “He failed miserably.” As of Thursday morning, the United States had the world’s largest number of both coronavirus cases, with at least 5.5 million, and deaths, with at least 173,000, according to a New York Times database. The Sarang Jeil Church in Seoul has been a magnet for thousands of conservative Christians who fear South Korea is turning communist under President Moon Jae-in. But the church’s political crusade is now colliding with the pandemic, as a large outbreak centered on the church spreads through the capital Seoul and beyond. Members have recently participated in some of the largest antigovernment protests that South Korea has seen in years, and many have contracted the coronavirus. In the past week, the outbreak has forced the church to shut down, and its congregants to isolate themselves at home. The church’s chief pastor, the Rev. Jun Kwang-hoon, is among the infected. The outbreak pushed South Korea’s daily caseload to 288 on Thursday, the seventh straight day of triple-digit jumps, which shattered hopes that the country had managed to blunt the epidemic sooner than most nations. It marked the biggest cluster of infections in South Korea since an outbreak in the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the central city of Daegu in February and March was tied to 5,200 patients. Mr. Moon has accused his most vocal critics of spreading the infectious disease and putting the entire nation in danger — a sentiment widespread on social media. Conservative activists have accused Mr. Moon of trying to scapegoat the church to divert attention from his weak approval ratings. India’s coronavirus crisis is now spreading to the hinterlands along its southern coastline. The country recorded at least 69,000 new cases on Wednesday, its largest daily caseload of the pandemic, and nearly a thousand deaths, according to a New York Times database and the ministry of health. The South Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu now account for nearly a third of new cases in the country. After nearly three months in lockdown, millions of migrant workers, who over the years had gravitated to jobs in the cities, have recently been pouring back into the countryside. Many of them have become carriers of the virus, epidemiologists say. Officials in Andhra Pradesh state, which has a total of 316,003 cases, one of the highest in the country, said fishermen arriving from the neighboring state of Tamil Nadu also contributed to the high case numbers, the BBC reported. Monsoon rains have forced thousands of people in villages to seek shelter in cramped spaces, often shared by several others. India has the world’s third-highest caseload after the United States and Brazil, but the actual numbers are thought to be much higher because of limited testing and contact tracing. “The number of cases which we are reporting are only the tip of the iceberg,” said Dr. Jayaprakash Muliyil, a former professor at the Christian Medical College in Vellore, and a member of the national Covid-19 task force. Despite the surge in cases, B. S. Yediyurappa, the chief minister of the southern state of Karnataka, announced this week that his government would allow gatherings of up to 20 people for an upcoming Hindu festival because of the “religious sentiments” of its people. Mr. Yediyurappa tested positive for the virus this month. Throughout the pandemic, coronavirus-related slogans have been everywhere. In Britain: “Stay alert. Control the virus. Save lives.” The French issued a similar plea: “Save lives. Stay prudent.” In the Netherlands, the government has urged people to act “together against Corona” and talked about an “intelligent lockdown.” They’re not just catchy phrases in a time of crisis. They make a difference, and they should be readily understandable for people of all reading levels. A study by the JAMA Network that looked at the language used in April about the pandemic on websites of international agencies as well as the governments of 15 countries found that in most cases, the language exceeded the recommended eighth-grade reading level, using complex syntax and technical terms. All of the websites in the study — including those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and governments around the world — shared at least some information that exceeded the recommended reading level, according to the study. Not adhering to readability standards could have a bigger influence on communities with lower health literacy, the study found, “potentially exacerbating the disparate effects of the pandemic.” As a result, the study concluded that governments and institutions should “focus on the urgent development of plain-language Covid-19 resources that conform to established guidelines for clear communication and are more accessible to all audiences.” Of those websites the JAMA Network examined, the information from the Netherlands used the most accessible language overall, while Italy used the most complex. GLOBAL ROUNDUP North Korea said on Thursday that the triple punches of the pandemic, international sanctions and flood damage had significantly delayed plans to improve the country’s economy. During a meeting in Pyongyang, the capital, the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party attributed the delay to “severe internal and external situations and unexpected manifold challenges,” and noted that people’s living standards had “not been improved remarkably.” The assessment was an unprecedented admission by the isolated country that its economic plans had faltered. When Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader, took power after the death of his father in 2011, he vowed to ensure that his people would “never have to tighten their belt again.” In 2016, when Mr. Kim adopted his economic plan, the North’s economy grew 3.9 percent, the highest since a devastating famine hit the country in the late 1990s, according to estimates by South Korea’s central bank, the Bank of Korea. But as the United Nations tightened sanctions, the North’s economy shrank 3.5 percent in 2017, according to the Bank of Korea. It contracted 4.1 percent the following year, with its exports to China plummeting 86 percent. North Korea’s economy recovered slightly last year, growing 0.4 percent, as Pyongyang invented ways of easing the pain of the sanctions, such as smuggling banned cargo across the Chinese border or between ships on the high seas. But this year, the coronavirus forced the country to shut down the border with China, which had accounted for more than 90 percent of the North’s external trade. North Korea’s exports to China plummeted to $27 million in the first half of this year, a 75 percent drop from a year earlier, according to the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul. Imports from China dropped 67 percent, to $380 million. In other developments around the world: Health officials in China issued new guidelines on Thursday that exempt residents of Beijing, the capital, from wearing masks outdoors unless they come into close contact with strangers. The country has reported fewer than 300 infections over the past week, according to a New York Times database. In a tweet, Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China’s Foreign Ministry, weighed in on images of a recent pool party in Wuhan — the city where the pandemic began — that have touched a nerve in countries where many people remain under lockdown. “The city only emerges stronger,” she wrote. Global Times, a popular state-run tabloid, also said that international criticism of the party amounted to “foreign sour grapes.” While the moving industry is fractured among numerous small-business owners, and official statistics are tough to come by, one thing is clear: From professionals who are downsizing following a job loss, to students moving back in with their parents, to families fleeing the city for the suburbs, New Yorkers are changing their addresses in droves. According to FlatRate Moving, the number of moves it has done has increased more than 46 percent between March 15 and Aug. 15, compared with the same period last year. The number of those moving outside of New York City is up 50 percent — including a nearly 232 percent increase to Dutchess County and 116 percent increase to Ulster County in the Hudson Valley. “It felt like move-out day on a college campus,” said Bobby DelGreco, who recently vacated his apartment in Stuyvesant Town after nine years and is now living in a long-term Airbnb in Los Angeles. “All the doors were propped open, and there were moving trucks and furniture everywhere.” Matt Jahn, who owns the Brooklyn-based Metropolis Moving, said he has been inundated with customer requests. It’s more demand than he can handle. “We are turning people away because we just don’t have the capacity,” he said. It certainly didn’t start out this way. In mid-March, when the grim realities of the virus became clear, moving companies braced for a slow season. “Right in the beginning, we weren’t sure if we were allowed to work, and a lot of businesses were in limbo,” said Daniel Norber, the owner of Imperial Movers, based in the West Village. “Everyone was wondering if they should close shop.” But later that month, the governor announced that moving was considered an essential service. “Within 30 minutes of the announcement I got a flood of calls,” Mr. Jahn said. Business hasn’t slowed since, and movers expect the trend to continue through the fall. German tourists took an unauthorized dip in the Grand Canal in Venice, under the Rialto Bridge. An Austrian tourist broke the toe of a plaster statue of Napoleon’s sister while posing for a photograph at a museum in northern Italy. A French tourist was caught red-handed using a black felt-tip pen to immortalize her stay in Florence on the city’s famed Ponte Vecchio. Now, Italian officials have set their sights on a young woman who took a selfie standing atop some newly reopened thermal baths in Pompeii, the fragile archaeological site. The coronavirus pandemic may have crushed the tourism industry in Italy this year — delivering a significant blow to the country’s economy — but Italians say that should not give tourists who do come a free pass to run amok among the country’s cultural treasures. “There’s a question of vigilance, but also of the unpreparedness of visitors,” read an editorial published on Tuesday in the Rome daily La Repubblica. “What happened in Pompeii shows that the path to educating those who visit museums is still dotted with difficulties and unforeseen events,” a nod to countless episodes of vandalism and damage caused to cultural treasures by visiting tourists. Lawmakers in the lower house of Parliament introduced a bill last month that would toughen penalties for those convicted of destroying Italy’s artistic patrimony. Culture Minister Dario Franceschini has been trying to put such a law on the books since 2016, but has not managed to get approval from both houses of Parliament.
