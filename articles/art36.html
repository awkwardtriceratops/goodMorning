Week 4: Tom Brady, Buccaneers Struggling Against Chargers<br></h1><p id="artcont">Rookie quarterback Justin Herbert and the Los Angeles Chargers are dominating Tampa Bay. Football’s schedule rumbles on despite positive Covid-19 tests. By Benjamin Hoffman, Ben Shpigel and Bill Pennington RIGHT NOW Justin Herbert’s second TD pass puts Los Angeles ahead, 21-7, over Tom Brady and the Buccaneers. The idea of “tests” in the N.F.L. is usually a figurative one — how will Team X respond to the test of So-and-So’s defense? Until this week, pro football had been blissfully unencumbered by the scrambling and rescheduling to deal with positive coronavirus tests that other leagues have dealt with. Despite the highly anticipated Cam Newton vs. Patrick Mahomes matchup being delayed, much of the N.F.L.’s Week 4 slate will go on, as scheduled. After Saints fullback Michael Burton tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday, his re-test and a rapid test reportedly came back negative, keeping the New Orleans-Detroit game on pace to play. Elsewhere, the league’s unbeatens will try to stick with what’s working. Five possessions, four touchdowns for the Cleveland Browns, who are pummeling a porous Dallas defense. The latest score, a 2-yard run by Kareem Hunt that extended the Browns’ lead to 28-14 midway through the second quarter, is the first on the ground Sunday by the A.F.C.’s second-leading rushing offense. Hunt is assuming a heavier workload after one of the N.F.L.’s leading rushers, Nick Chubb, sustained a knee injury that sidelined him in the first half. He is out for the game. Chubb’s injury came on a freak play: As Baker Mayfield escaped the pocket and rolled right, away from him, the Dallas defensive lineman Trysten Hill was blocked into Chubb, causing him to fall at an awkward angle. Entering Sunday, Chubb, who had 6 carries for 43 yards before getting hurt, had rushed for 292 yards, trailing only Tennessee’s Derrick Henry (319), Green Bay’s Aaron Jones (303) and Minnesota’s Dalvin Cook (294). The Chargers-Buccaneers game pits Tom Brady, 42, and rookie quarterback Justin Herbert, 22, and the 20-year, 219-day gap in age between the quarterbacks is the biggest in N.F.L. history. But midway through the second quarter, Herbert is having the better day. Herbert threw his second touchdown pass to tight end Donald Parham to put Los Angeles ahead, 21-7. At the end of a 13-play drive, Herbert lofted a nifty touch pass that Parham, who is 6-foot-8, jumped over a defender to snatch out of the air. Herbert has completed eight of 11 passes for 116 yards. Brady has struggled to move Tampa Bay since its opening drive, which led to a touchdown. The Saints might be playing without six starters, and they nearly lost two more players to injury on one series, but at least they still have a healthy Alvin Kamara. Three plays after extending the drive with a 29-yard catch on fourth-and-4, Kamara bulled into the end zone from 1 yard out to even the score in Detroit at 14-14. The Saints, after a rough start, are coping well without tight end Jared Cook, defensive end Marcus Davenport, cornerbacks Janoris Jenkins and Marshon Lattimore, receiver Michael Thomas and offensive lineman Andrus Peat, all of whom were ruled out on Friday. After Kamara’s touchdown, the Saints thwarted a promising Lions drive by intercepting Matthew Stafford in the end zone. New Orleans has scored 21 straight points to go up 21-14 on Detroit with under three minutes remaining. Tom Brady began the game with a smooth and efficient opening drive that ended with a 3-yard touchdown to tight end Cameron Brate — the Buccaneers’ third opening drive touchdown of the season. But the Chargers quarterback Justin Hebert answered with a long touchdown — a 53-yard bomb to Tyron Johnson — on his team’s first drive to tie the score, 7-7. On the Buccaneers next possession, Brady threw his fourth pick-six in his last six games when Chargers cornerback Michael Davis stepped in front of Tampa Bay wide receiver Mike Evans and intercepted a sideline pass, returning it 78 yards for a touchdown that put the Chargers ahead, 14-7. On the Buccaneers previous possession, Evans had beaten Davis on a similar route along the left sideline. Los Angeles running back Austin Ekeler appeared to sustain a serious injury to his left knee late in the first quarter of the Chargers game with Tampa Bay. Running to his right, Ekeler avoided a low tackle but his left leg seemed to hyperextend. He continued upfield but could not put weight on his left leg and was knocked to the ground. Ekeler was helped off the field and eventually hopped on one leg to a cart which transported him off the field. After a night spent contact-tracing and testing players in the wake of their starting fullback’s false positive test, the New Orleans Saints have gotten out to a horrific start in Detroit. On the Lions’ opening drive, Matthew Stafford exploited a diluted Saints defense on third-and-9 from their own 36-yard line for a 50-yard pass play. He connected with Danny Amendola, who turned a short pass into a long catch, dodging tacklers to set up Detroit’s first touchdown, a 7-yard reception by running back D’Andre Swift. Drew Brees’s first play from scrimmage, a short pass over the middle intended for Emmanuel Sanders, was picked off by Detroit cornerback Darryl Roberts and returned to the New Orleans 16-yard line. The turnover positioned the Lions for a three-play drive, capped by Stafford’s 15-yard pass to Kenny Golladay. Not even 5 minutes into the game, New Orleans trailed by 14-0. But the Saints responded with a 13-play, 75-yard scoring drive that Latavius Murray finished with a flourish, a powerful 3-yard run. 
When Jarvis Landry heard that his team, the Cleveland Browns, acquired Odell Beckham Jr. before last season, he started to sob. “He was like, say it ain’t so, coach,” the former Browns receivers coach Adam Henry recalled last summer. “He was just quiet, like he was crying on the phone.” Beckham and Landry have a deep connection. They grew up an hour or so apart in Louisiana, where their friendship blossomed in high school. They played together at L.S.U. They wanted to play together in the N.F.L. someday, to share the same locker room, to make dazzling catches in warm-ups together, to collaborate on plays that produced the Browns’ first touchdown on Sunday. On first-and-10 from the Cleveland 37-yard line, Landry took a pitch from Nick Chubb and whipped a magnificent spiral downfield to Beckham, who was open in the end zone. It was another encouraging sign from a Cleveland offense that has relied on the run — the Browns are the only team, with Chubb and Kareem Hunt, to have two 200-yard rushers this season — to win the last two games. But it was also another discouraging moment for the Cowboys’ defense, which was torched by Russell Wilson last week and, over all, allowed nine touchdown passes heading into Sunday. Make that 10. With Tennessee and Pittsburgh inadvertently idle, Green Bay playing on Monday and Kansas City having to wait for their game until Monday or Tuesday, just three teams have a shot at improving to 4-0 on Sunday. Here is a ranking of the likelihood that each of them gets there. 1. Seattle — The Seahawks are setting N.F.L. records on offense, and doing absolutely nothing to help on defense. It’s an issue as far as the team’s Super Bowl prospects, but it is unlikely to matter against Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Miami Dolphins (1-2), even on the road. 2. Buffalo — The Bills have a lot to work out before they can truly be considered a contender, but quarterback Josh Allen is loving life with wide receiver Stefon Diggs. That dynamic duo gives the team a solid shot at victory in a road game against the Las Vegas Raiders (2-1), but Buffalo’s defense will need to play far better than it has this season if they want to continue their winning streak. 3. Chicago — There is no reasonable explanation for the Bears being 3-0 other than luck. The team’s defense is not terrible, but it’s hardly good enough to make up for an offense in such turmoil that they had a quarterback controversy without ever losing a game. Now, with Nick Foles set as the starter, they are hosting the 2-1 Indianapolis Colts, and while anything is possible, Chicago won’t want to bank on the Colts simply handing them a victory like Detroit and Atlanta did. A road game against the Dallas Cowboys (1-2) is a fairly stiff test, but the Cleveland Browns would come away with something sensational if they were able to win: a 3-1 record for the first time since 2001 and just the second time since the franchise was resurrected in 1999. If they make it through this week unscathed, the Browns would then host Indianapolis in Week 5 with a chance at 4-1. They have not started that well since the 1994, when their 4-1 start turned into an 11-5 finish and a wild-card round win over New England — the last playoff win in franchise history. The best Browns start, however, came in 1948, when Otto Graham led them to a 14-0 regular season and the A.A.F.C. championship. With no new positive coronavirus tests among the New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs, the N.F.L. announced that their game — scheduled for Sunday afternoon — will be played Monday night at Arrowhead Stadium. The game will start at 7:05 p.m. Eastern time, and to accommodate that change, the league pushed back the Monday Night Football matchup between Atlanta and Green Bay to 8:50 p.m. The league on Saturday postponed the Chiefs-Patriots game after two players — New England quarterback Cam Newton and the Kansas City practice-squad quarterback Jordan Ta’amu — tested positive, delaying one of the early season’s more intriguing games and casting doubt upon the N.F.L.’s ability to contest a full season. Additional testing of players and employees conducted Saturday and Sunday revealed no new positive tests, giving the N.F.L. confidence that the game could be played this week. The N.F.L. said that Kansas City and New England worked with the players’ union and infectious disease experts to conduct contact tracing, though it is still possible, given the incubation period of the virus, that other positive tests emerge. The Tennessee Titans, fighting to contain an outbreak within their organization that is known to have infected 20 members, have had players or personnel test positive for six consecutive days, causing their scheduled Week 4 game against Pittsburgh to be postponed and imperiling their next game, at home Buffalo on Oct. 11. It’s almost impossible to estimate how big of an impact it will be for the New England Patriots to play without Cam Newton this week, as he has quickly spearheaded a radical challenge in the team’s offense in just three starts for the team. Thanks to Newton, Sony Michel and Rex Burkhead, the Patriots are leading the N.F.L. in rushing yards and rushing touchdowns and are fifth in the N.F.L. in yards per carry. How unusual is that? In the entire Brady era, the Patriots never finished better than fifth in rushing yards and were a top-10 team just seven times. Meanwhile, they finished in the N.F.L.’s bottom 10 in rushing yards four times, with a low mark of 30th in 2015. New England’s change in style would have been incredibly relevant this week, as the Kansas City Chiefs are perhaps the N.F.L.’s best team, but their closest thing to a weak link is their ability to defend the run, with their defense ranked 30th of 32 teams in run defense efficiency, according to Football Outsiders. But to keep up with Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, the Patriots would have needed the threat of Newton’s passing to set up the team’s running game, and Brian Hoyer simply does not have that same level of respect from opposing defenses. As players and staff members of the Tennessee Titans continued to test positive for the coronavirus throughout the week, it was clear that the team’s game against the Pittsburgh Steelers could not be contested. The league had initially hoped they could play Monday or Tuesday, but instead this matchup of 3-0 teams has been pushed to Week 7 — the Titans’ bye-week and an easy enough switch for Pittsburgh, which will have its game against Baltimore pushed ahead to what would have been both of those teams’ bye weeks in Week 8. That the change in schedule only affected three teams, and won’t require anyone to play outside of their normal seven-day preparation cycle, is fairly impressive, but the change will mean that both Tennessee and Pittsburgh will finish the regular season playing in 13 consecutive weeks without a break. If either were to wear down at the end of the season, this compromise will surely be cited. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
