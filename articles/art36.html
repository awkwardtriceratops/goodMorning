I’m Ross Douthat. And this is “The Argument.” [MUSIC PLAYING] This week, the president has the coronavirus. His White House is a hot zone. What does it mean for the election? And then, what happens after election day if we still don’t know who won, if Trump doesn’t accept the loss, if Congress or the Court has to choose the next president? A week ago now, the president of the United States tested positive for the coronavirus and was swiftly admitted to Walter Reed Hospital. After a bevy of treatments, he was released even as positive tests spread throughout his senior staff. And he’s returned to the White House with a message that Americans need not cower in fear of the virus, that he’s beating it, and so can we. I’m certain that Michelle has some thoughts — [LAUGHTER] — on all of these events. But since David is here as our special guest, I want to start with him. First, David, welcome back to “The Argument.” Yeah, welcome. It’s an intimidating honor to be back. You know, you survived the first time. We’ll see how this one goes. The big picture question is are we actually, finally, living through the end of the Trump presidency right now? I thought you were going to say living through the end of days. That’s my sentiment. That’s my question for Michelle. [LAUGHTER] David, I want you to take the president for questions. This has been sort of an astonishing week. Are you astonished? I would say what’s surprised me is the emails I’ve gotten from my Trump supporting friends have been all about masculinity. That this guy is so manly, that he’s not afraid. He’s willing to stand up. He’s willing to be invulnerable. And what it reminds me of is a hyper version of something I’ve seen all my life and maybe share a little. Men are so afraid, they don’t like to go to the hospital. Men are so afraid, they don’t like to face an illness. Back years ago, I was covering the H.I.V. crisis in Africa. And I went to a hospital where there were 840 women who were getting the treatments, ARV treatments. And they were trying to get their male partners to come in. And they got, like, six of them out of the 840 male partners to come in. And that’s because there’s a certain sort of fear that manifests as invulnerability. And I think Donald Trump has that fear. But a lot of people have translated that into that’s what we like. We like a guy who does not show any vulnerability. And a lot of people find it extremely attractive. And I sort of think that’s the dynamic of Trump and this virus in this week. Well, look, I mean, that’s what’s going to get a lot of people killed, right? I mean, I think that the first thing to say about the way Donald Trump has behaved this week is that he has dramatically heightened the chances of an expanded pandemic. There was that woman at the D.N.C. who talked about how her father’s main pre-existing condition was that he listened to Donald Trump. Right? There are more people who are going to— not a majority, people are going to listen to Donald Trump. They’re going to take the message that it is manly to face this virus without fear or precaution. And they’re not just going to get themselves killed, but they’re going to get a lot of other people killed. This presidency is basically the human embodiment of an airborne toxic event, to quote Don DeLillo. But more than that. I mean, I think what’s happened over the last week, when he first got sick, there was this weird moment where the normal way that we talk about the president and the kind of moral status that we accord to the presidency came into really sharp conflict with the moral status of Donald Trump. Rachel Maddow was very earnestly praying for the president’s health. And so there was this moment when he could have translated this setback into renewed sympathy, into a sort of taboo against talking about what a vile figure he was. He might have, if he had had any emotional reserves or sort of any kind of psychological self-awareness, been able to use this to at least feign empathy for the unbelievable suffering of people who’ve gone through this illness, or whose friends and relatives have gone through this illness, or whose lives have been offended by this illness. But of course he can’t do that, because he’s one of the worst people in America. And so over the last week as it’s become clear that he has callously disregarded the safety of people around him, exposed all sorts of people to the virus, lied about the virus, used his own experience with the virus to go back to these talking points about it being not as dangerous as the flu, sort of refused to recognize that his superb treatment, including the use of monoclonal antibodies — and I for one am really, really hopeful that monoclonal antibodies have helped him, because I have a lot of hope that they will eventually be in a position to help more people— but he sort of refused to admit that his extraordinary treatment is what’s responsible. If there’s a quick turnaround, that is what’s responsible for it, not his sort of personal fortitude. And that’s the perfect metaphor for everything about Donald Trump, who is given everything, who has inherited all of this money, has been bailed out multiple times. And yet insists on believing that it’s all due to some kind of inequality that he has. And so by behaving so terribly, there is reporting that he’s insisting on going to the Oval Office even though he’s obviously still infectious, except for his hardcore base, he has completely eroded whatever kind of sympathy bounce a remotely normal president would have gotten out of this. And instead, he has turned his own infection into a metaphor for the catastrophic way he has allowed this infection — to use his words — dominate the country. So to I have two thoughts on this. And then David, you can get back in. On your first point, Michelle, about the way, the interesting way, let’s say, that people who hate Donald Trump and spend all their time attacking Donald Trump felt compelled to sort of talk gently about him and talk about praying for him and so on, if I can delve into medieval political theology for a minute, which is, of course, my — Which is always where this was going? [LAUGHTER] Which is always where this was going. There’s a somewhat famous book by a guy named Ernst Kantorowicz called “The King’s Two Bodies,” which is about how the person of the king was thought of in the Middle Ages. He says, “The King has in him two bodies, a body natural and a body politic. His body natural, considered in itself is a body mortal, subject to all infirmities that come by nature or accident to the imbecility of infancy or old age. But then his body politic is a body that cannot be seen or handled, consisting of policy and government, constituted for the direction of the people and the management of the public weal.” I could go on. We could do a whole segment of me just quoting that, but we probably shouldn’t. But I think people — we obviously don’t officially have a king. And we have sort of left the Middle Ages behind in various ways. But I think people think about the presidency in the sort of two bodies way. And they don’t think about it with quite the separation that that Kantorowicz quote implies. I think people collapse, pretty naturally, the health of the president as a sort of mortal finite human being with the health of their government. And so it doesn’t surprise me that people who, if Trump were a private citizen, wouldn’t have this kind of pray for him reaction, do have that reaction. Right. But then I think the flip side of that is possibly why, at least from the polls we’ve seen so far, his poll numbers have collapsed even further since getting sick, which is not what you would expect to happen. It doesn’t seem to be what happened to Boris Johnson, even though there’s some debate about when exactly his bounce came. But because, when you said they collapse, the health of the president and the health of the government. And in this case, it is so obvious that this was such a wake up call about the deep, deep sickness in our government. Yeah. I think it’s that that was the debate. I’m not sure I’m convinced yet that the illness had a big effect on the polls. I happened to be up at 1:00 AM when the news broke, because I thought it was a brilliant idea to start watching “Saving Private Ryan” at 10:30. [LAUGHTER] Because you’ve never found out how it ended. I thought I was just going to watch the first bloody scene. And then you can’t stop. And I was deeply unnerved, really. And I think I was unnerved, primarily, for the body politic. I mean, the guy is our president. But I also was unnerved for just the person. He’s a human being. And some people do seem to forfeit any sympathy. When somebody is sick, they’re naked. Their humanity is much more naked. And I would say that Trump’s various videos have sort of — the first one, you feel the most sympathy for him. The one where he’s in Walter Reed without makeup and he’s saying we’ve got to get back to making America great again. I still felt some sympathy. And then, by the time he’s back at the White House talking about how he beat the virus and so on, then you don’t. Then the sympathy sort of leeches away. But I think that you just have a different relationship with the president, a more personal-seeming relationship than you do with almost any other celebrity, except maybe a really big movie star. The other question is whether we should allow ourselves permission to hate a political leader or whether that’s a dangerous emotion. You can treat him as sort of this malevolent weather storm. But there is the line that hatred corrupts the soul. And that one should recognize him for what he is without trying to hate him. Well, I don’t think you have to try to hate him. I think you have to try not to hate him, right? But that, to me, is just an unbelievable psychological effort. And I agree, you know, that hatred does corrupt the soul. And I think that my soul has been corrupted over these last four years, the worst four years of my life. I think the country, a lot of the country still has been corrupted. And so I do make an effort to check those thoughts, to not hate him. Hatred is not always a choice when somebody is simultaneously destroying your country. And you know, since the virus started rampaging through the country is also destroying your life personally. I wrote a column that I guess did the Rachel Maddow thing and said at the end that we should pray for Donald Trump. And my mother, who is a more prayerful and religiously serious person than I am, read the column and said, you know, Ross, you really should have said that since most of your readership does hate Donald Trump, you should have urged them to pray for his conversion, not just to pray for his life. That that’s actually sort of the opportunity, and especially if you’re trying to sort of escape from the feeling of hatred that Trump inspires for so many people. I think my mother was right. I think that’s what I should have said in the column. Again, I don’t think we have a lot of evidence right now that he has been changed. So let’s go back to where we started and just talk about the politics of this for a minute. I’m stealing this from someone on Twitter but I wonder if this is sort of the equivalent of the Lehman Brothers moment in the 2008 election, where Barack Obama had a lead over John McCain for most of the race. It seemed like he had a good chance of winning. But there was this sort of decisive moment in September when it became clear that the only question was how big the rout was going to be. That’s how this feels like right now. Michelle, since you worry most about the prospect of a Trump second term, do you see any comeback scenario here? I mean, I don’t think so. But again, I don’t think I will ever be over the trauma of the 2016 elections until he is out of the White House. I would go back to the Lehman Brothers analogy. I think usually there comes a moment in every election or many elections where it’s either order or chaos. And when Lehman Brothers broke, Obama looked like order and McCain suddenly looked like chaos. And in ‘68, the riots, Humphrey suddenly looked like chaos, and Nixon looked like order. And Trump tried to make himself on the side of order. His whole convention was “law and order.” But suddenly, the events of this week, the debate — I still think the debate is more important. The debate and the disease, suddenly he looks like disorder. He can’t protect himself. And people, basically, they don’t expect a lot from government. But just don’t screw things up. And they’ve seen Donald Trump be a force for chaos for four years now. And as Michelle points out, it’s not the people who hate Donald Trump are still hating Donald Trump. That’s not what skews the election. It’s the people who used to like Donald Trump. And those are the people to focus on. And some of them are women. Biden is winning among women by 2 to 1 almost. That’s astounding. And seniors, right? And seniors. In these blowout polls, if it is a blowout, it will be because a large population of normally Republican voting American seniors decided that Trump’s message of we should all fight the coronavirus and win was not appealing. So it’s these people who are shifting. And I don’t think they’re shifting on policy grounds. They’re A, exhausted, and B, he just looks like chaos machine. And in that sense, that’s one place where I think his instincts might have been right. Right? His instinct to understand how much getting sick and how much looking sick potentially damaged him. He reacted to it in a completely crazy and self-destructive way. But I think he does understand that there is something of a puncturing of the image that he tried to create. Vulnerability is the thing he can never do. And it’s been fascinating to me throughout this. And I’ve said this repeatedly in columns without necessarily having people agree. But I always assumed Trump would be terrible in a crisis. I also would have assumed, though, that a crisis of a deadly pandemic would be, in a weird way, his best kind of crisis. Because we know a certain amount about his fundamental germaphobia. And it’s just really interesting that his desire to maintain an image of invulnerability has been more important to him than his any kind of germaphobia. That, like, the Trump who didn’t want to shake hands with people was not powerful enough to overcome the Trump who couldn’t bear to be seen in a mask or have anyone around him in a mask. Yeah. But his selfishness trumps everything. I mean, as you’ve written recently, Ross, he should have seen this coming. I mean, Steve Bannon saw it coming. Tucker Carlson saw it coming. Because here was this foreign invasion from China. And so it was right in his ideological lane. But his ideology is way downstream from his selfishness. And I think his germaphobia is also downstream from selfishness. I talked to a political scientist in Nebraska two weeks ago. And the thing that’s always puzzled me is Republicans are really all throughout the political psychology for decades, Republicans are really attuned to threat. Their threat perception just tends to be way higher. And so I asked this guy, here was a big threat. Why are Republicans not concerned about threat? And he said, if you look at the research, it’s only threat from people. They don’t care about climate change. They don’t care about the pandemic. They do care about threat from immigrants or the Chinese communists. They’re very attuned to threat from people, but not threat from things. And so maybe — I don’t know. See — But this is also a threat— but this is also a threat from people, right? I mean — I mean, I have lost a lot of faith in that kind of research, actually, through this experience. Right? I mean, Republicans were freaked out by Ebola when Obama was president. And you could say, well, that’s a threat from Africa. But this was a threat from China, which is a country that looms large in the conservative imagination as a threat. My faith in those kind of psychological readings of ideology has been weakened by this. It just all seems more unpredictable than those kind of psychological frameworks would suggest. [MUSIC PLAYING] We’ll be right back. And we’re back. For several weeks now, listeners have been writing in to ask us to argue about what might happen post-election, meaning in a window of time between when the ballots are cast and when we actually find out who won. One listener, Danny, who I think encapsulates many of your emails, wrote, “It’s become increasingly clear that should Trump not be declared the winner on election night, he will do everything in his power to tie up the election, both legally in the court system, where the Supreme Court is stacked in his favor, and physically with the promotion of far right violence, martial law, refusal to leave office, et cetera. What does ‘The Argument’ team see as plausible, possible results should this occur?” So the way we thought about talking about all of this was to consider three different scenarios. In the first one, it’s a scenario where Joe Biden pretty clearly wins. Trump pretty clearly loses. But as Danny’s suggested, Trump somehow refuses to leave. In the second Trump wins the way he did last time, only more so, with a big popular vote deficit and a narrow win in the electoral college. And the question is how Democrats would react. And then the third scenario is a contested election where there’s, as with Florida in 2000, a dispute over just hundreds of ballots in a particular state that leads to an argument over that state’s electoral votes that goes all the way to Congress. And David, we wanted you to join us for this discussion because you wrote a column about what obligations ordinary American citizens might have in some of those scenarios. So I want to start with you. And let’s start with the first scenario, because that’s the scenario that I think seems like the nightmare for people who fear Trump’s authoritarianism, which is a situation where, after a few days of vote counting, it’s clear Biden has won. But let’s say Trump declares he won’t recognize the victory. He alleges massive voter fraud. And he just somehow declares himself— Wait! Can I just interrupt you for a second, Ross? Yes. To me, that’s not the nightmare scenario. To me, that’s the sort of enjoyable scenario in which we get to see him dragged out of the White House by security, which would be kind of a wish fulfillment for a lot of people. To me, the nightmare scenario is 10,000 Florida recounts. The nightmare scenario is them throwing the result into doubt and disarray so that there’s never any real resolution. Or even if there is real resolution about who won among people with regard to facts, there is enough doubt for Republican legislators to say, vote their own slate of electors, or otherwise steal the elections. Anyway, sorry. Yeah. You’ve just leaped ahead in my carefully constructed system, Michelle. [LAUGHTER] I guess I want to stay with the first one, though. Because I think the third is the nightmare scenario for you hyper-informed New York Times pundit. But when I talk to, let’s say, normal Americans, as I occasionally do — Where? [LAUGHING] —I think there is an anxiety about the gap between an initial vote count that’s close and a subsequent vote count that includes more mail in ballots that’s clearly for Biden. And there’s a fear that Trump exploits that difference. And you know, he ended the last debate by saying mail in voting would be riddled by fraud. So I agree with you. I don’t think that’s a scenario where actually Trump succeeds in staying in office. But why isn’t it? What happens then? Kind of the question is where’s the crisis? Is it in Washington? Or is it in the state legislatures? And nightmare scenario one is it’s in Washington. And I don’t think we should underestimate the psychological shock we’ll all go through. On November 3, if it is close, Trump will look ahead. And then over the next days as the mail in votes will count, what they call the blue shift will happen. And suddenly, it’ll more likely look that Biden is ahead. That emotional roller coaster, we can imagine what it’s like. But it’s actually going to be really horrible to go through that roller coaster on both sides. Because Trump will say, I won. I won. I won. Nonetheless, my instinct is, I’m maybe naive about scenario number one, but I think if he clearly loses, I think the Republican Party will be reasonably — especially state legislatures — will be reasonably happy to get rid of him. And there’s, like, 18% of Republicans who think he’s the greatest president ever. That’s literally true when you ask. But most Republicans, especially the kind of person who’s a state legislator, they’re not in that camp. They were Republicans before Trump came along. They’re more Republican than they are Trump. They’re hopefully patriotic. And so I do think, if Biden is pretty clearly the winner, that Trump will be forced to leave. And he’ll either drag out or he’ll walk out with his tail between his legs. The way, as far as I can tell, from the way states count votes, it’s not the case that every state counts ballots cast on election day first and then counts mail in ballots. There are states that count mail in ballots first. So it’s this scenario where you have sort of a red advantage and then a blue wave. I think the reality will be more complicated than that. Yeah, but Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are states that can’t count the ballots until election day. So — I mean, I agree with you. I guess we all agree on this. But it’s sort of worth stressing for the anxious that, if on November 6th Biden is clearly winning by several percentage points in all of the key swing states, that there isn’t some magic wand that Trump can wave that enables him to do a coup. I mean, I think that’s true. I think it’s especially true because you can’t imagine the military helping him. All the real, like, authoritarian nightmare scenarios involve a president like Trump having some kind of large scale support from entities other than his core supporters and his own political party. Well, he has ICE. And he has C.P.B. And you know, he has Bill Barr. So there’s some sort of paramilitary factions that he can call on. But yeah, I don’t see the military going on with a naked coup. I can imagine some of them seriously interfering in the vote counting. Right? So the nightmare scenario is that Bill Barr calls for some sort of seizure of contested ballots or something along those lines. I’m interested in the second scenario which, again, appears relatively unlikely, given the polls right now. But is the most likely scenario where Trump wins, right, is the same thing that happened in 2016 except with an even bigger gap between the popular vote and the electoral college. And so you can imagine a world where Trump wins Pennsylvania clearly. He wins it by, like, 47,000 votes or something. And he does the same across enough of the states he won last time. And meanwhile, he narrowly Texas. He narrowly wins Georgia. He loses California in an unprecedented blowout. And you end up with a scenario where Biden has beaten him, you know, 53 to 45, and Trump has won the electoral college. So there was there have been these sort of war games that have gotten a lot of publicity, maybe not justly, about what happens in various election scenarios. And in one of the war games, there was a scenario like this. And you had John Podesta sort of embodying the Biden campaign and refusing to concede and literally urging California and other blue states to threaten some kind of secession if there isn’t some kind of negotiated deal that gets Trump out of office. Yeah. To me, that was the most unbelievable part of all of those scenarios. Not that there wouldn’t be people who would want to secede in those circumstances. But it’s not going to come from John Podesta. It’s not going to come from Biden. I think, in that circumstance, you would see a more serious movement than you’ve ever seen for secession in some of the blue states. And frankly, I think I would be part of it. I don’t think it would happen overnight. But I think it would start the processes that turn the break up of the United States from something completely far-fetched to something that would gradually start to seem more plausible and perhaps eventually even inevitable. But but don’t you think there’d be something in between? Like, I don’t know what it would be. But something in between secession movement and just acting the way the Democrats acted after 2016, which was sort of attacking Trump’s legitimacy in various ways, but still cooperating with his inauguration and so on. Like, David, what do you think? In this scenario, what weird things happen on the Democratic side? First of all, I don’t think succession really survives five minutes of scrutiny. The federal government and the state government of the people of California are so interwoven. Think about what it’s like to cut all those ties. Just housing aid, education aid, agricultural subsidies, it would just be completely disrupted. So I don’t think people are going to go for that. I may be imagining a fissure that doesn’t exist. And I imagine, on the Republican side, that there are a lot of Republicans who really put the Constitution and the country over Donald Trump. And I imagine there are a lot of Democrats who say the rules suck. The electoral college sucks. But those are the rules and we can’t just rip up — we can now try to change the rules. But we can’t re-conduct an election not playing by the rules of the Constitution. And the Constitution doesn’t say these rules apply, except for when the president’s really bad and then suddenly these don’t rules don’t apply. The Constitution says the rules apply. And so I would be stunned if there was, like, a fundamental non-cooperation with the process, even as much as people may hate the process. I think something weird would happen. And I think it would be somewhere — I guess I’m in between Michelle’s grassroots secession future and David’s cooperation. I think you’d have real pressure on Democratic elected officials to, at the very least, make sort of a extraordinary symbolic gestures of non-cooperation. And this gets us maybe more to our third scenario. But in states where it was close, there would be pressure to say, especially if the states have a voter ID law or something, to say, well, Joe Biden really won this state. Voter suppression probably made the difference. And so if the state has a Democratic governor, he sho.ld certify an alternate slate of electors which, Pennsylvania has a Democratic governor, Wisconsin has a Democratic governor. I don’t know how far this would go. But I think you would have a search for some set of actions in between secession and business as usual that could lead to some, at the very least, unexpected developments. Again, if Biden wins by 7 and loses the electoral college, which is very, very unlikely, but is not completely impossible. I sort of think you need the ambiguity. If we don’t really know who wins, then everybody has permission to do everything ruthless. So to me, scenario three is the nightmare scenario. You know, that happened in 1876 in the Tilden-Hayes race. Once people had enough ambiguity to just steal votes, and they could say, I’m not stealing votes, I’m just interpreting the votes my way, then we saw, in 1876, they’re going to do that. And I think in scenario three, that then we really are in a nightmare scenario. So scenario three is, it’s sort of five Florida’s. It’s 2000 all over again, except we’re doing recounts in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Florida and a couple other places. And then goes to a Supreme Court with this justice who Democrats believe is being pushed through in an illegitimate process and who Trump has explicitly said must be seated before the election so that she can decide the election. But before — so what’s interesting to me in reading about the election of 1876, among other things, is what happens before you get to the Supreme Court, which is the reality that most people, myself included, have been somewhat unaware of. That American election law has provisions for scenarios where, let’s say, a state with a Democratic legislature and a Republican governor or vice versa end up sending competing slates of electors, but nobody can agree on what the provisions of the law mean. Who actually decides? Does the Speaker of the House decide? does Mike Pence decide in his capacity as president of the Senate? There is all kinds of basically crazy ambiguity about how you resolve this scenario. Right. But that’s why it will end up in the Supreme Court If the Supreme Court takes it. I mean, the law stipulates that this is resolved in Congress. So obviously, you would have lawsuits about the balloting and so on. And the Supreme Court stepped in 2000 and effectively ruled in a way that sided with George W. Bush. But you could imagine John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett getting together and saying, we’re just going to leave this up to Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi to work out. I’m sorry. But you’re talking about people who worked on the Bush 2000 recount. Right? These to me, I mean, I know you think highly of some of these people. But I think to me and to most Democrats, these are people who has been devoted to cementing Republican power at all costs for their entire career. I’m not sure they want to get involved. John Roberts, he has shown a predilection in the past to not want to get the Court involved in total partisanship. I think Congress — there’s going to be a big congressional phase before there would be a Court phase, if we get to this scenario. With the legislature phase, say we get competing electors. Then it goes to Congress. And there’s super ambiguity. One of the things I’m learning is how much of this is not spelled out in the Constitution. Right. So what the Constitution spells out are dates, right? There’s a date when Donald Trump ceases to be president if he isn’t re-elected. And everything else is in election law. And I mean, I would recommend to listeners who are interested in this on a scale that we can’t quite capture here, but there’s a article in The Atlantic called “The Terrifying Inadequacy of American Election Law” from about a month ago. That sort of walks through the various moments where it’s just unclear who in Congress is deciding which slate of electors to recognize with the added twist that, according to some interpretations of the law, if Congress can’t decide, then in late January, Nancy Pelosi automatically becomes president. From either of your perspectives, do you think, in a situation where the election outcome is genuinely uncertain, in the sense that it’s like Florida, where different styles of recounts yield different outcomes, can you imagine Congress negotiating and ending up sort of picking a president, absent the Supreme Court, absent anything else? I can’t. I can’t. Yeah, I can’t either. Just to fill people in 1870’s, basically the Democrats said you can have your president. But you’ve got to end Reconstruction and give us back the South. And that was horrific. Can I ask you guys a question? So in the event of all of this, you both think secession, even kind of long term, is a less of a live possibility than I do, do you think civil war is a possibility? [LONG PAUSE, GLASS TINKLES] Uh, we’ve got to wrap this segment up. [LAUGHTER] Take care. [LAUGHTER] I mean, so know. Quickly, no. I mean, I have always assumed that freak outs over civil war were radically overblown. And that fundamentally, I think I said this on a previous episode to you, Michelle. But I think one thing about Donald Trump that we’ve seen is he doesn’t actually mobilize large numbers of people to take to the streets. He couldn’t get a big crowd at his inauguration. He has some militia members and various people who sort of want to instigate fights on his behalf. But there isn’t a Trumpian equivalent to the March for Women or the Black Lives Matter protest, to begin with. Then I think the number of Americans who want to engage in violence against their fellow citizens is mercifully, incredibly low. I mean, the way you actually get civil wars in modern societies is you have a sort of breakdown in the monopoly on force, where some region or power center can offer a sort of alternative institution of force to the central government. I don’t see how that possibly happens in contemporary America. And yeah, I mean, in a world where the Supreme Court rules for Donald Trump at the end of two months of wrangling and Trump becomes president, I think you get a new wave of marches in the style of what we saw over the summer. I think you get all kinds of unpredictable things. I don’t think what you get would be called a civil war. I agree. The weaponry is — not many of us have ICBMs that we can wield in a civil war. So yeah, I think that’s not going to happen. But I mean, just to echo something that you said, I think if this all happens it is our duty as citizens to do what they’re doing in Belarus. Mmhmm. To be out on the streets. And I think if that happens, Ross is right.There won’t be competing crowds. But wait, David, but this is my question for you, right? This is why I sketched this out in multiple scenarios. I think your column made the case that you absolutely have to be on the street for a scenario where Trump is literally trying to do a coup. But in a scenario where it is actually totally ambiguous who won, the Supreme Court rules 6 to 3 that the Trumpian interpretation of ballot counting in Pennsylvania or something is the correct one, or that the Pennsylvania legislature has the right to appoint electors, or something that’s within reasonable interpretations of election law, I think in that scenario, Michele is in the streets. But are you? I’m in the streets if — I don’t think it’ll really be ambiguous. I think an objective observer will be able to say Biden won. But there’ll be enough ambiguity for a lot of Republicans who persuaded themselves that he didn’t win. In that case, you absolutely have to be in the streets. So I think you have to try to be an honest observer and just come to an honest opinion about what happened. But not everybody’s going to recognize that reality. That’s been the story of the last four or five years. One of the difficulties in talking about all of these nightmare scenarios is that, on the one hand, I do think people need to start making kind of mental preparations and even practical preparations to be out in the streets in the event of some of these worst case scenarios. Right? Like, I really did agree with David’s column with the Belarus comparison. And you can go to Protect The Vote and sort of sign up to see what sort of actions there are going to be. At the same time, I think that some of this can be immensely demobilizing. Right? It’s one reason that Donald Trump is constantly calling the election into question, constantly saying that the election is going to be fraudulent. Part of it is to excuse his own possible loss. But I think part of it is to make people feel powerless, to make them feel like they can’t just vote him out. And so I’m not overly worried about people not going to the polls. Because I think there’s so many people who are just desperate to get rid of this man. But I think the closing thing has to be is that people have some agency in this. That these nightmare scenarios await us if people don’t deliver a decisive result. But the ability to deliver a decisive result is in the hands of the American people right now. And that is a perfect place to rest. David, we wanted to do a recommendation at the end of the show, as we do. And the last time we had you on, if memory serves, you recommended Taylor Swift’s then new album, “Lover.” Right? And since you’ve been gone, if you will, [BROOKS LAUGHS] there’s been a new Taylor Swift album, released in the middle of the pandemic. So at the risk of presumption, I’m wondering if you would recommend that album as well. Yeah. It’s ironic I’m now being tagged as the Taylor Swift person. You have Thomas Aquinas. I have Taylor Swift. [LAUGHTER] But the new album is called “Folklore.” And I think it’s among her best albums. She’s an impressive lyricist. I think her best song on that album is called “Exile,” which is a very sad duet with Bon Iver. [MUSIC - TAYLOR SWIFT/BON IVER, “EXILE”] All this time we always walked a very thin line. You didn’t even hear me out. Didn’t even hear me out. It’s an album that’s endless. She wrote a lot of songs on it. And so I highly recommend that. I’ll throw in one, which is my core lifelong musical love, which is Bruce Springsteen has an album coming out in a few weeks. There’s a very good song that’s already been released called “Ghosts,” which is on YouTube or wherever you find your music. But I’ve heard a bit of that album. And it’s among his best, which is amazing, at 71, to be producing among your best. That is truly remarkable. You know, I had very little interest in Taylor Swift for most of her career. And first of all, I love this new album. It’s also the first album that my children have turned me on to. My children had heard the song “Exile,” actually, with their babysitter and were demanding that I play it in the car. Yeah. This is fascinating to me. Because my kids also really like “Exile,” which is not a kid’s song. But it is catchy, I guess. Yeah, but it’s incredibly melancholy. You know, and this album, she worked on it with a guy from one of my favorite bands, The National. You know, because my mind has been turned to poison by politics. and so I think about Taylor Swift much differently post-politicization. You know, right now that Taylor Swift has turned out to have vastly better politics than Kanye West. [LAUGHTER] But yeah, even without that, I would maybe quietly love the album if we still thought that she was a closet Republican. Now I openly love the album. So David, again, I guess it’s a dual recommendation. So what’s the dual recommendation again? “Folklore” is the name of the Taylor Swift album and “Letter To You” is the name of the Springsteen album coming out in weeks. Terrific. Thanks, David. Thank you. Thank you so much for joining us, David. Pleasure to be with you. And that’s our show for the week. Thank you so much for listening in these strange times.

OK. [LAUGHTER] To the people! TRANSCRIPT I’m Michelle Goldberg. I’m David Brooks. I’m Ross Douthat. And this is “The Argument.” [MUSIC PLAYING] This week, the president has the coronavirus. His White House is a hot zone. What does it mean for the election? And then, what happens after election day if we still don’t know who won, if Trump doesn’t accept the loss, if Congress or the Court has to choose the next president? A week ago now, the president of the United States tested positive for the coronavirus and was swiftly admitted to Walter Reed Hospital. After a bevy of treatments, he was released even as positive tests spread throughout his senior staff. And he’s returned to the White House with a message that Americans need not cower in fear of the virus, that he’s beating it, and so can we. I’m certain that Michelle has some thoughts — [LAUGHTER] — on all of these events. But since David is here as our special guest, I want to start with him. First, David, welcome back to “The Argument.” Yeah, welcome. It’s an intimidating honor to be back. You know, you survived the first time. We’ll see how this one goes. The big picture question is are we actually, finally, living through the end of the Trump presidency right now? I thought you were going to say living through the end of days. That’s my sentiment. That’s my question for Michelle. [LAUGHTER] David, I want you to take the president for questions. This has been sort of an astonishing week. Are you astonished? I would say what’s surprised me is the emails I’ve gotten from my Trump supporting friends have been all about masculinity. That this guy is so manly, that he’s not afraid. He’s willing to stand up. He’s willing to be invulnerable. And what it reminds me of is a hyper version of something I’ve seen all my life and maybe share a little. Men are so afraid, they don’t like to go to the hospital. Men are so afraid, they don’t like to face an illness. Back years ago, I was covering the H.I.V. crisis in Africa. And I went to a hospital where there were 840 women who were getting the treatments, ARV treatments. And they were trying to get their male partners to come in. And they got, like, six of them out of the 840 male partners to come in. And that’s because there’s a certain sort of fear that manifests as invulnerability. And I think Donald Trump has that fear. But a lot of people have translated that into that’s what we like. We like a guy who does not show any vulnerability. And a lot of people find it extremely attractive. And I sort of think that’s the dynamic of Trump and this virus in this week. Well, look, I mean, that’s what’s going to get a lot of people killed, right? I mean, I think that the first thing to say about the way Donald Trump has behaved this week is that he has dramatically heightened the chances of an expanded pandemic. There was that woman at the D.N.C. who talked about how her father’s main pre-existing condition was that he listened to Donald Trump. Right? There are more people who are going to— not a majority, people are going to listen to Donald Trump. They’re going to take the message that it is manly to face this virus without fear or precaution. And they’re not just going to get themselves killed, but they’re going to get a lot of other people killed. This presidency is basically the human embodiment of an airborne toxic event, to quote Don DeLillo. But more than that. I mean, I think what’s happened over the last week, when he first got sick, there was this weird moment where the normal way that we talk about the president and the kind of moral status that we accord to the presidency came into really sharp conflict with the moral status of Donald Trump. Rachel Maddow was very earnestly praying for the president’s health. And so there was this moment when he could have translated this setback into renewed sympathy, into a sort of taboo against talking about what a vile figure he was. He might have, if he had had any emotional reserves or sort of any kind of psychological self-awareness, been able to use this to at least feign empathy for the unbelievable suffering of people who’ve gone through this illness, or whose friends and relatives have gone through this illness, or whose lives have been offended by this illness. But of course he can’t do that, because he’s one of the worst people in America. And so over the last week as it’s become clear that he has callously disregarded the safety of people around him, exposed all sorts of people to the virus, lied about the virus, used his own experience with the virus to go back to these talking points about it being not as dangerous as the flu, sort of refused to recognize that his superb treatment, including the use of monoclonal antibodies — and I for one am really, really hopeful that monoclonal antibodies have helped him, because I have a lot of hope that they will eventually be in a position to help more people— but he sort of refused to admit that his extraordinary treatment is what’s responsible. If there’s a quick turnaround, that is what’s responsible for it, not his sort of personal fortitude. And that’s the perfect metaphor for everything about Donald Trump, who is given everything, who has inherited all of this money, has been bailed out multiple times. And yet insists on believing that it’s all due to some kind of inequality that he has. And so by behaving so terribly, there is reporting that he’s insisting on going to the Oval Office even though he’s obviously still infectious, except for his hardcore base, he has completely eroded whatever kind of sympathy bounce a remotely normal president would have gotten out of this. And instead, he has turned his own infection into a metaphor for the catastrophic way he has allowed this infection — to use his words — dominate the country. So to I have two thoughts on this. And then David, you can get back in. On your first point, Michelle, about the way, the interesting way, let’s say, that people who hate Donald Trump and spend all their time attacking Donald Trump felt compelled to sort of talk gently about him and talk about praying for him and so on, if I can delve into medieval political theology for a minute, which is, of course, my — Which is always where this was going? [LAUGHTER] Which is always where this was going. There’s a somewhat famous book by a guy named Ernst Kantorowicz called “The King’s Two Bodies,” which is about how the person of the king was thought of in the Middle Ages. He says, “The King has in him two bodies, a body natural and a body politic. His body natural, considered in itself is a body mortal, subject to all infirmities that come by nature or accident to the imbecility of infancy or old age. But then his body politic is a body that cannot be seen or handled, consisting of policy and government, constituted for the direction of the people and the management of the public weal.” I could go on. We could do a whole segment of me just quoting that, but we probably shouldn’t. But I think people — we obviously don’t officially have a king. And we have sort of left the Middle Ages behind in various ways. But I think people think about the presidency in the sort of two bodies way. And they don’t think about it with quite the separation that that Kantorowicz quote implies. I think people collapse, pretty naturally, the health of the president as a sort of mortal finite human being with the health of their government. And so it doesn’t surprise me that people who, if Trump were a private citizen, wouldn’t have this kind of pray for him reaction, do have that reaction. Right. But then I think the flip side of that is possibly why, at least from the polls we’ve seen so far, his poll numbers have collapsed even further since getting sick, which is not what you would expect to happen. It doesn’t seem to be what happened to Boris Johnson, even though there’s some debate about when exactly his bounce came. But because, when you said they collapse, the health of the president and the health of the government. And in this case, it is so obvious that this was such a wake up call about the deep, deep sickness in our government. Yeah. I think it’s that that was the debate. I’m not sure I’m convinced yet that the illness had a big effect on the polls. I happened to be up at 1:00 AM when the news broke, because I thought it was a brilliant idea to start watching “Saving Private Ryan” at 10:30. [LAUGHTER] Because you’ve never found out how it ended. I thought I was just going to watch the first bloody scene. And then you can’t stop. And I was deeply unnerved, really. And I think I was unnerved, primarily, for the body politic. I mean, the guy is our president. But I also was unnerved for just the person. He’s a human being. And some people do seem to forfeit any sympathy. When somebody is sick, they’re naked. Their humanity is much more naked. And I would say that Trump’s various videos have sort of — the first one, you feel the most sympathy for him. The one where he’s in Walter Reed without makeup and he’s saying we’ve got to get back to making America great again. I still felt some sympathy. And then, by the time he’s back at the White House talking about how he beat the virus and so on, then you don’t. Then the sympathy sort of leeches away. But I think that you just have a different relationship with the president, a more personal-seeming relationship than you do with almost any other celebrity, except maybe a really big movie star. The other question is whether we should allow ourselves permission to hate a political leader or whether that’s a dangerous emotion. You can treat him as sort of this malevolent weather storm. But there is the line that hatred corrupts the soul. And that one should recognize him for what he is without trying to hate him. Well, I don’t think you have to try to hate him. I think you have to try not to hate him, right? But that, to me, is just an unbelievable psychological effort. And I agree, you know, that hatred does corrupt the soul. And I think that my soul has been corrupted over these last four years, the worst four years of my life. I think the country, a lot of the country still has been corrupted. And so I do make an effort to check those thoughts, to not hate him. Hatred is not always a choice when somebody is simultaneously destroying your country. And you know, since the virus started rampaging through the country is also destroying your life personally. I wrote a column that I guess did the Rachel Maddow thing and said at the end that we should pray for Donald Trump. And my mother, who is a more prayerful and religiously serious person than I am, read the column and said, you know, Ross, you really should have said that since most of your readership does hate Donald Trump, you should have urged them to pray for his conversion, not just to pray for his life. That that’s actually sort of the opportunity, and especially if you’re trying to sort of escape from the feeling of hatred that Trump inspires for so many people. I think my mother was right. I think that’s what I should have said in the column. Again, I don’t think we have a lot of evidence right now that he has been changed. So let’s go back to where we started and just talk about the politics of this for a minute. I’m stealing this from someone on Twitter but I wonder if this is sort of the equivalent of the Lehman Brothers moment in the 2008 election, where Barack Obama had a lead over John McCain for most of the race. It seemed like he had a good chance of winning. But there was this sort of decisive moment in September when it became clear that the only question was how big the rout was going to be. That’s how this feels like right now. Michelle, since you worry most about the prospect of a Trump second term, do you see any comeback scenario here? I mean, I don’t think so. But again, I don’t think I will ever be over the trauma of the 2016 elections until he is out of the White House. I would go back to the Lehman Brothers analogy. I think usually there comes a moment in every election or many elections where it’s either order or chaos. And when Lehman Brothers broke, Obama looked like order and McCain suddenly looked like chaos. And in ‘68, the riots, Humphrey suddenly looked like chaos, and Nixon looked like order. And Trump tried to make himself on the side of order. His whole convention was “law and order.” But suddenly, the events of this week, the debate — I still think the debate is more important. The debate and the disease, suddenly he looks like disorder. He can’t protect himself. And people, basically, they don’t expect a lot from government. But just don’t screw things up. And they’ve seen Donald Trump be a force for chaos for four years now. And as Michelle points out, it’s not the people who hate Donald Trump are still hating Donald Trump. That’s not what skews the election. It’s the people who used to like Donald Trump. And those are the people to focus on. And some of them are women. Biden is winning among women by 2 to 1 almost. That’s astounding. And seniors, right? And seniors. In these blowout polls, if it is a blowout, it will be because a large population of normally Republican voting American seniors decided that Trump’s message of we should all fight the coronavirus and win was not appealing. So it’s these people who are shifting. And I don’t think they’re shifting on policy grounds. They’re A, exhausted, and B, he just looks like chaos machine. And in that sense, that’s one place where I think his instincts might have been right. Right? His instinct to understand how much getting sick and how much looking sick potentially damaged him. He reacted to it in a completely crazy and self-destructive way. But I think he does understand that there is something of a puncturing of the image that he tried to create. Vulnerability is the thing he can never do. And it’s been fascinating to me throughout this. And I’ve said this repeatedly in columns without necessarily having people agree. But I always assumed Trump would be terrible in a crisis. I also would have assumed, though, that a crisis of a deadly pandemic would be, in a weird way, his best kind of crisis. Because we know a certain amount about his fundamental germaphobia. And it’s just really interesting that his desire to maintain an image of invulnerability has been more important to him than his any kind of germaphobia. That, like, the Trump who didn’t want to shake hands with people was not powerful enough to overcome the Trump who couldn’t bear to be seen in a mask or have anyone around him in a mask. Yeah. But his selfishness trumps everything. I mean, as you’ve written recently, Ross, he should have seen this coming. I mean, Steve Bannon saw it coming. Tucker Carlson saw it coming. Because here was this foreign invasion from China. And so it was right in his ideological lane. But his ideology is way downstream from his selfishness. And I think his germaphobia is also downstream from selfishness. I talked to a political scientist in Nebraska two weeks ago. And the thing that’s always puzzled me is Republicans are really all throughout the political psychology for decades, Republicans are really attuned to threat. Their threat perception just tends to be way higher. And so I asked this guy, here was a big threat. Why are Republicans not concerned about threat? And he said, if you look at the research, it’s only threat from people. They don’t care about climate change. They don’t care about the pandemic. They do care about threat from immigrants or the Chinese communists. They’re very attuned to threat from people, but not threat from things. And so maybe — I don’t know. See — But this is also a threat— but this is also a threat from people, right? I mean — I mean, I have lost a lot of faith in that kind of research, actually, through this experience. Right? I mean, Republicans were freaked out by Ebola when Obama was president. And you could say, well, that’s a threat from Africa. But this was a threat from China, which is a country that looms large in the conservative imagination as a threat. My faith in those kind of psychological readings of ideology has been weakened by this. It just all seems more unpredictable than those kind of psychological frameworks would suggest. [MUSIC PLAYING] We’ll be right back. And we’re back. For several weeks now, listeners have been writing in to ask us to argue about what might happen post-election, meaning in a window of time between when the ballots are cast and when we actually find out who won. One listener, Danny, who I think encapsulates many of your emails, wrote, “It’s become increasingly clear that should Trump not be declared the winner on election night, he will do everything in his power to tie up the election, both legally in the court system, where the Supreme Court is stacked in his favor, and physically with the promotion of far right violence, martial law, refusal to leave office, et cetera. What does ‘The Argument’ team see as plausible, possible results should this occur?” So the way we thought about talking about all of this was to consider three different scenarios. In the first one, it’s a scenario where Joe Biden pretty clearly wins. Trump pretty clearly loses. But as Danny’s suggested, Trump somehow refuses to leave. In the second Trump wins the way he did last time, only more so, with a big popular vote deficit and a narrow win in the electoral college. And the question is how Democrats would react. And then the third scenario is a contested election where there’s, as with Florida in 2000, a dispute over just hundreds of ballots in a particular state that leads to an argument over that state’s electoral votes that goes all the way to Congress. And David, we wanted you to join us for this discussion because you wrote a column about what obligations ordinary American citizens might have in some of those scenarios. So I want to start with you. And let’s start with the first scenario, because that’s the scenario that I think seems like the nightmare for people who fear Trump’s authoritarianism, which is a situation where, after a few days of vote counting, it’s clear Biden has won. But let’s say Trump declares he won’t recognize the victory. He alleges massive voter fraud. And he just somehow declares himself— Wait! Can I just interrupt you for a second, Ross? Yes. To me, that’s not the nightmare scenario. To me, that’s the sort of enjoyable scenario in which we get to see him dragged out of the White House by security, which would be kind of a wish fulfillment for a lot of people. To me, the nightmare scenario is 10,000 Florida recounts. The nightmare scenario is them throwing the result into doubt and disarray so that there’s never any real resolution. Or even if there is real resolution about who won among people with regard to facts, there is enough doubt for Republican legislators to say, vote their own slate of electors, or otherwise steal the elections. Anyway, sorry. Yeah. You’ve just leaped ahead in my carefully constructed system, Michelle. [LAUGHTER] I guess I want to stay with the first one, though. Because I think the third is the nightmare scenario for you hyper-informed New York Times pundit. But when I talk to, let’s say, normal Americans, as I occasionally do — Where? [LAUGHING] —I think there is an anxiety about the gap between an initial vote count that’s close and a subsequent vote count that includes more mail in ballots that’s clearly for Biden. And there’s a fear that Trump exploits that difference. And you know, he ended the last debate by saying mail in voting would be riddled by fraud. So I agree with you. I don’t think that’s a scenario where actually Trump succeeds in staying in office. But why isn’t it? What happens then? Kind of the question is where’s the crisis? Is it in Washington? Or is it in the state legislatures? And nightmare scenario one is it’s in Washington. And I don’t think we should underestimate the psychological shock we’ll all go through. On November 3, if it is close, Trump will look ahead. And then over the next days as the mail in votes will count, what they call the blue shift will happen. And suddenly, it’ll more likely look that Biden is ahead. That emotional roller coaster, we can imagine what it’s like. But it’s actually going to be really horrible to go through that roller coaster on both sides. Because Trump will say, I won. I won. I won. Nonetheless, my instinct is, I’m maybe naive about scenario number one, but I think if he clearly loses, I think the Republican Party will be reasonably — especially state legislatures — will be reasonably happy to get rid of him. And there’s, like, 18% of Republicans who think he’s the greatest president ever. That’s literally true when you ask. But most Republicans, especially the kind of person who’s a state legislator, they’re not in that camp. They were Republicans before Trump came along. They’re more Republican than they are Trump. They’re hopefully patriotic. And so I do think, if Biden is pretty clearly the winner, that Trump will be forced to leave. And he’ll either drag out or he’ll walk out with his tail between his legs. The way, as far as I can tell, from the way states count votes, it’s not the case that every state counts ballots cast on election day first and then counts mail in ballots. There are states that count mail in ballots first. So it’s this scenario where you have sort of a red advantage and then a blue wave. I think the reality will be more complicated than that. Yeah, but Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are states that can’t count the ballots until election day. So — I mean, I agree with you. I guess we all agree on this. But it’s sort of worth stressing for the anxious that, if on November 6th Biden is clearly winning by several percentage points in all of the key swing states, that there isn’t some magic wand that Trump can wave that enables him to do a coup. I mean, I think that’s true. I think it’s especially true because you can’t imagine the military helping him. All the real, like, authoritarian nightmare scenarios involve a president like Trump having some kind of large scale support from entities other than his core supporters and his own political party. Well, he has ICE. And he has C.P.B. And you know, he has Bill Barr. So there’s some sort of paramilitary factions that he can call on. But yeah, I don’t see the military going on with a naked coup. I can imagine some of them seriously interfering in the vote counting. Right? So the nightmare scenario is that Bill Barr calls for some sort of seizure of contested ballots or something along those lines. I’m interested in the second scenario which, again, appears relatively unlikely, given the polls right now. But is the most likely scenario where Trump wins, right, is the same thing that happened in 2016 except with an even bigger gap between the popular vote and the electoral college. And so you can imagine a world where Trump wins Pennsylvania clearly. He wins it by, like, 47,000 votes or something. And he does the same across enough of the states he won last time. And meanwhile, he narrowly Texas. He narrowly wins Georgia. He loses California in an unprecedented blowout. And you end up with a scenario where Biden has beaten him, you know, 53 to 45, and Trump has won the electoral college. So there was there have been these sort of war games that have gotten a lot of publicity, maybe not justly, about what happens in various election scenarios. And in one of the war games, there was a scenario like this. And you had John Podesta sort of embodying the Biden campaign and refusing to concede and literally urging California and other blue states to threaten some kind of secession if there isn’t some kind of negotiated deal that gets Trump out of office. Yeah. To me, that was the most unbelievable part of all of those scenarios. Not that there wouldn’t be people who would want to secede in those circumstances. But it’s not going to come from John Podesta. It’s not going to come from Biden. I think, in that circumstance, you would see a more serious movement than you’ve ever seen for secession in some of the blue states. And frankly, I think I would be part of it. I don’t think it would happen overnight. But I think it would start the processes that turn the break up of the United States from something completely far-fetched to something that would gradually start to seem more plausible and perhaps eventually even inevitable. But but don’t you think there’d be something in between? Like, I don’t know what it would be. But something in between secession movement and just acting the way the Democrats acted after 2016, which was sort of attacking Trump’s legitimacy in various ways, but still cooperating with his inauguration and so on. Like, David, what do you think? In this scenario, what weird things happen on the Democratic side? First of all, I don’t think succession really survives five minutes of scrutiny. The federal government and the state government of the people of California are so interwoven. Think about what it’s like to cut all those ties. Just housing aid, education aid, agricultural subsidies, it would just be completely disrupted. So I don’t think people are going to go for that. I may be imagining a fissure that doesn’t exist. And I imagine, on the Republican side, that there are a lot of Republicans who really put the Constitution and the country over Donald Trump. And I imagine there are a lot of Democrats who say the rules suck. The electoral college sucks. But those are the rules and we can’t just rip up — we can now try to change the rules. But we can’t re-conduct an election not playing by the rules of the Constitution. And the Constitution doesn’t say these rules apply, except for when the president’s really bad and then suddenly these don’t rules don’t apply. The Constitution says the rules apply. And so I would be stunned if there was, like, a fundamental non-cooperation with the process, even as much as people may hate the process. I think something weird would happen. And I think it would be somewhere — I guess I’m in between Michelle’s grassroots secession future and David’s cooperation. I think you’d have real pressure on Democratic elected officials to, at the very least, make sort of a extraordinary symbolic gestures of non-cooperation. And this gets us maybe more to our third scenario. But in states where it was close, there would be pressure to say, especially if the states have a voter ID law or something, to say, well, Joe Biden really won this state. Voter suppression probably made the difference. And so if the state has a Democratic governor, he sho.ld certify an alternate slate of electors which, Pennsylvania has a Democratic governor, Wisconsin has a Democratic governor. I don’t know how far this would go. But I think you would have a search for some set of actions in between secession and business as usual that could lead to some, at the very least, unexpected developments. Again, if Biden wins by 7 and loses the electoral college, which is very, very unlikely, but is not completely impossible. I sort of think you need the ambiguity. If we don’t really know who wins, then everybody has permission to do everything ruthless. So to me, scenario three is the nightmare scenario. You know, that happened in 1876 in the Tilden-Hayes race. Once people had enough ambiguity to just steal votes, and they could say, I’m not stealing votes, I’m just interpreting the votes my way, then we saw, in 1876, they’re going to do that. And I think in scenario three, that then we really are in a nightmare scenario. So scenario three is, it’s sort of five Florida’s. It’s 2000 all over again, except we’re doing recounts in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Florida and a couple other places. And then goes to a Supreme Court with this justice who Democrats believe is being pushed through in an illegitimate process and who Trump has explicitly said must be seated before the election so that she can decide the election. But before — so what’s interesting to me in reading about the election of 1876, among other things, is what happens before you get to the Supreme Court, which is the reality that most people, myself included, have been somewhat unaware of. That American election law has provisions for scenarios where, let’s say, a state with a Democratic legislature and a Republican governor or vice versa end up sending competing slates of electors, but nobody can agree on what the provisions of the law mean. Who actually decides? Does the Speaker of the House decide? does Mike Pence decide in his capacity as president of the Senate? There is all kinds of basically crazy ambiguity about how you resolve this scenario. Right. But that’s why it will end up in the Supreme Court If the Supreme Court takes it. I mean, the law stipulates that this is resolved in Congress. So obviously, you would have lawsuits about the balloting and so on. And the Supreme Court stepped in 2000 and effectively ruled in a way that sided with George W. Bush. But you could imagine John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett getting together and saying, we’re just going to leave this up to Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi to work out. I’m sorry. But you’re talking about people who worked on the Bush 2000 recount. Right? These to me, I mean, I know you think highly of some of these people. But I think to me and to most Democrats, these are people who has been devoted to cementing Republican power at all costs for their entire career. I’m not sure they want to get involved. John Roberts, he has shown a predilection in the past to not want to get the Court involved in total partisanship. I think Congress — there’s going to be a big congressional phase before there would be a Court phase, if we get to this scenario. With the legislature phase, say we get competing electors. Then it goes to Congress. And there’s super ambiguity. One of the things I’m learning is how much of this is not spelled out in the Constitution. Right. So what the Constitution spells out are dates, right? There’s a date when Donald Trump ceases to be president if he isn’t re-elected. And everything else is in election law. And I mean, I would recommend to listeners who are interested in this on a scale that we can’t quite capture here, but there’s a article in The Atlantic called “The Terrifying Inadequacy of American Election Law” from about a month ago. That sort of walks through the various moments where it’s just unclear who in Congress is deciding which slate of electors to recognize with the added twist that, according to some interpretations of the law, if Congress can’t decide, then in late January, Nancy Pelosi automatically becomes president. From either of your perspectives, do you think, in a situation where the election outcome is genuinely uncertain, in the sense that it’s like Florida, where different styles of recounts yield different outcomes, can you imagine Congress negotiating and ending up sort of picking a president, absent the Supreme Court, absent anything else? I can’t. I can’t. Yeah, I can’t either. Just to fill people in 1870’s, basically the Democrats said you can have your president. But you’ve got to end Reconstruction and give us back the South. And that was horrific. Can I ask you guys a question? So in the event of all of this, you both think secession, even kind of long term, is a less of a live possibility than I do, do you think civil war is a possibility? [LONG PAUSE, GLASS TINKLES] Uh, we’ve got to wrap this segment up. [LAUGHTER] Take care. [LAUGHTER] I mean, so know. Quickly, no. I mean, I have always assumed that freak outs over civil war were radically overblown. And that fundamentally, I think I said this on a previous episode to you, Michelle. But I think one thing about Donald Trump that we’ve seen is he doesn’t actually mobilize large numbers of people to take to the streets. He couldn’t get a big crowd at his inauguration. He has some militia members and various people who sort of want to instigate fights on his behalf. But there isn’t a Trumpian equivalent to the March for Women or the Black Lives Matter protest, to begin with. Then I think the number of Americans who want to engage in violence against their fellow citizens is mercifully, incredibly low. I mean, the way you actually get civil wars in modern societies is you have a sort of breakdown in the monopoly on force, where some region or power center can offer a sort of alternative institution of force to the central government. I don’t see how that possibly happens in contemporary America. And yeah, I mean, in a world where the Supreme Court rules for Donald Trump at the end of two months of wrangling and Trump becomes president, I think you get a new wave of marches in the style of what we saw over the summer. I think you get all kinds of unpredictable things. I don’t think what you get would be called a civil war. I agree. The weaponry is — not many of us have ICBMs that we can wield in a civil war. So yeah, I think that’s not going to happen. But I mean, just to echo something that you said, I think if this all happens it is our duty as citizens to do what they’re doing in Belarus. Mmhmm. To be out on the streets. And I think if that happens, Ross is right.There won’t be competing crowds. But wait, David, but this is my question for you, right? This is why I sketched this out in multiple scenarios. I think your column made the case that you absolutely have to be on the street for a scenario where Trump is literally trying to do a coup. But in a scenario where it is actually totally ambiguous who won, the Supreme Court rules 6 to 3 that the Trumpian interpretation of ballot counting in Pennsylvania or something is the correct one, or that the Pennsylvania legislature has the right to appoint electors, or something that’s within reasonable interpretations of election law, I think in that scenario, Michele is in the streets. But are you? I’m in the streets if — I don’t think it’ll really be ambiguous. I think an objective observer will be able to say Biden won. But there’ll be enough ambiguity for a lot of Republicans who persuaded themselves that he didn’t win. In that case, you absolutely have to be in the streets. So I think you have to try to be an honest observer and just come to an honest opinion about what happened. But not everybody’s going to recognize that reality. That’s been the story of the last four or five years. One of the difficulties in talking about all of these nightmare scenarios is that, on the one hand, I do think people need to start making kind of mental preparations and even practical preparations to be out in the streets in the event of some of these worst case scenarios. Right? Like, I really did agree with David’s column with the Belarus comparison. And you can go to Protect The Vote and sort of sign up to see what sort of actions there are going to be. At the same time, I think that some of this can be immensely demobilizing. Right? It’s one reason that Donald Trump is constantly calling the election into question, constantly saying that the election is going to be fraudulent. Part of it is to excuse his own possible loss. But I think part of it is to make people feel powerless, to make them feel like they can’t just vote him out. And so I’m not overly worried about people not going to the polls. Because I think there’s so many people who are just desperate to get rid of this man. But I think the closing thing has to be is that people have some agency in this. That these nightmare scenarios await us if people don’t deliver a decisive result. But the ability to deliver a decisive result is in the hands of the American people right now. And that is a perfect place to rest. David, we wanted to do a recommendation at the end of the show, as we do. And the last time we had you on, if memory serves, you recommended Taylor Swift’s then new album, “Lover.” Right? And since you’ve been gone, if you will, [BROOKS LAUGHS] there’s been a new Taylor Swift album, released in the middle of the pandemic. So at the risk of presumption, I’m wondering if you would recommend that album as well. Yeah. It’s ironic I’m now being tagged as the Taylor Swift person. You have Thomas Aquinas. I have Taylor Swift. [LAUGHTER] But the new album is called “Folklore.” And I think it’s among her best albums. She’s an impressive lyricist. I think her best song on that album is called “Exile,” which is a very sad duet with Bon Iver. [MUSIC - TAYLOR SWIFT/BON IVER, “EXILE”] All this time we always walked a very thin line. You didn’t even hear me out. Didn’t even hear me out. It’s an album that’s endless. She wrote a lot of songs on it. And so I highly recommend that. I’ll throw in one, which is my core lifelong musical love, which is Bruce Springsteen has an album coming out in a few weeks. There’s a very good song that’s already been released called “Ghosts,” which is on YouTube or wherever you find your music. But I’ve heard a bit of that album. And it’s among his best, which is amazing, at 71, to be producing among your best. That is truly remarkable. You know, I had very little interest in Taylor Swift for most of her career. And first of all, I love this new album. It’s also the first album that my children have turned me on to. My children had heard the song “Exile,” actually, with their babysitter and were demanding that I play it in the car. Yeah. This is fascinating to me. Because my kids also really like “Exile,” which is not a kid’s song. But it is catchy, I guess. Yeah, but it’s incredibly melancholy. You know, and this album, she worked on it with a guy from one of my favorite bands, The National. You know, because my mind has been turned to poison by politics. and so I think about Taylor Swift much differently post-politicization. You know, right now that Taylor Swift has turned out to have vastly better politics than Kanye West. [LAUGHTER] But yeah, even without that, I would maybe quietly love the album if we still thought that she was a closet Republican. Now I openly love the album. So David, again, I guess it’s a dual recommendation. So what’s the dual recommendation again? “Folklore” is the name of the Taylor Swift album and “Letter To You” is the name of the Springsteen album coming out in weeks. Terrific. Thanks, David.

But with just weeks left in the 2020 campaign, what impact will his ill health — and subsequent spin — have on the election? Columnist David Brooks joins Michelle and Ross to talk about masculinity, sympathizing with someone you hate, and how the virus’s spread within Republican circles will play out among the electorate. Plus, Ross recites some medieval political theology. Then, what happens after Nov. 3? The columnists debate three possible outcomes for the election, ranging from dragging Trump out of the Oval Office with his “tail between his legs,” to secession and civil war. Finally, David is vindicated in a repeated recommendation of the lyricism of Taylor Swift, with some septuagenarian Springsteen on the side. Background Reading: David Brooks on what citizens should do if Trump does not leave, and the president’s moral chaos Ross on praying for Trump’s recovery, amid the tragedy Michelle on getting rid of Trump and a lie-infected White House Larry Diamond and Edward B.

I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they intersect. I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis, and decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have four small children, three girls and a boy, and live in New Haven with my wife. @DouthatNYT I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter. @michelleinbklyn “The Argument” is a production of the New York Times Opinion section.
