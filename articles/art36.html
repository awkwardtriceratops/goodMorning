Join us Friday for a conversation about what happened at President Trump’s convention and what’s ahead for 2020. It’s a momentous week: Unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. Hurricane Laura. The coronavirus death toll inching toward 180,000. And President Trump was formally renominated as his party’s presidential nominee at the Republican National Convention. On Friday,  Aug. 28 at 11 a.m. Eastern time we’ll be unpacking all of that and more. Join deputy politics editor Rachel Dry in conversation with John Eligon, a national correspondent who covers race; Annie Karni, a White House correspondent; and Jonathan Martin, a national political correspondent.
