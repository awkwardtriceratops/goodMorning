TRANSCRIPT “My father does not run away from challenges, even in the face of outright hatred, because fighting for America is something he will sacrifice anything for. He dreams big dreams for our country, and he is relentless at achieving them. You see, ‘Make America Great Again’ is not a slogan for my father. It is what drives him to keep his promise of doing what is right for American citizens.” “My father ran not because he needed the job, but because he knew hard-working people across this great country were being left behind. The media mocked these patriots in the ‘flyover states’ in which they lived. They ignored the Trump flags, they ignored the millions of MAGA banners and barns painted in red, white, and blue. The silent majority had no one fighting for them in either party. My father pledged to every American in every city, state, and town that he was going to make America great again. And so began the great American comeback.” “I think often about my ancestors who struggled for freedom. And as I think of those giants and their broad shoulders, I also think about Joe Biden, who says, ‘If you aren’t voting for me, you ain’t Black,’ who argued that Republicans would put us back in chains, who says there is no diversity of thought in the Black community. Mr. Vice President, look at me. I am Black. We are not all the same, sir. I am not in chains. My mind is my own. And you can’t tell me how to vote because of the color of my skin. I’m Mike Pompeo. I’m speaking to you from beautiful Jerusalem, looking out over the Old City. President Trump understands what my great fellow Kansan President Eisenhower said: For all that we cherish and justly desire for ourselves or for our children, the securing of peace is the first requisite. Indeed, the primary constitutional function of the national government is ensuring that your family and mine are safe and enjoy the freedom to live, to work, to learn and to worship as they choose.” “You are now fellow citizens of the greatest nation on the face of God’s Earth. Congratulations. Today you have also accepted the profound duties and responsibilities that come with American citizenship. By swearing the oath of allegiance, each of you has entered a sacred and unbreakable covenant with our nation. [music and applause] [cheering] I want to acknowledge the fact that since March our lives have changed drastically. The invisible enemy Covid-19 swept across our beautiful country and impacted all of us. My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one, and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering. I know many people are anxious, and some feel helpless. I want you to know you are not alone. I have reflected on the racial unrest in our country. It is a harsh reality that we are not proud of parts of our history. I encourage people to focus on our future while still learning from our past. Our diverse and storied history is what makes our country strong, and yet we still have so much to learn from one another. With that in mind, I’d like to call on the citizens of this country to take a moment, pause and look at things from all perspectives. I urge people to come together in a civil manner so we can work and live up to our standard American ideals. I don’t want to use this precious time attacking the other side, because as we saw last week, that kind of talk only serves to divide the country further. I’m here because we need my husband to be our president and commander in chief for four more years. He is what is best for our country. We all know Donald Trump makes no secrets about how he feels about things. Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president. Whether you like it or not, you always know what he’s thinking.” By Jennifer Medina and Adam Nagourney Adam: Jenny, I am exhausted. That was an overwhelming crush of stuff. It was like a mash-up of a reality show, a nonstop television advertisement and a convention. The stirring patriotic images, the rousing music, the heartfelt tributes and, of course, the slashing attacks. I’ve never seen so much of the inside of the White House. I feel like I traveled from Washington to Israel and back again in the course of two hours. Well, I guess we did. Most striking was how President Trump completely commandeered the White House — and the powers of the presidency — and put them to the service of his re-election campaign. He led a naturalization ceremony on the first floor of the White House. He pardoned Jon Ponder, a convicted bank robber who started a nonprofit to help former inmates. His wife, Melania Trump, spoke in the Rose Garden. I was left with one thought: What on earth will they do on Night 3? Jenny: I found myself searching for any historical analogy, wondering if I might have missed something. But no. There really isn’t another example of a president using the White House in such an obviously political way. He simply erased any line that might exist between government and politics. Even before tonight unfolded, there were questions whether the campaigning on government property violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits using federal posts for politics. Even the music — remember the pop hits Democrats featured last week? None of that tonight, replaced by instrumentals meant to evoke uniquely presidential power. Adam: Many government watchdogs have objected to what seems to be an egregious case of improper use of governmental resources to support a campaign. I’m not sure whether that hurts Mr. Trump in any way with voters. We’ll see. But the glitz and gimmicks (and the boundary breaking) should not come as a surprise for anyone who has watched him over the years, as a New York City developer, reality show host and now president of the United States. Jenny: Maybe. But when I saw five immigrants lined up in the White House while Mr. Trump walked in to “Hail to the Chief,” I wondered, who were those people being naturalized and how were they chosen? Of course, the president has railed against illegal immigration — but he has also made legal immigration enormously more difficult. There are large backlogs of people who have waited more than a decade for citizenship that have only been exacerbated by the pandemic. Adam: And symbolism aside, there was another night of brutal attacks on Joseph R. Biden Jr., to portray him as a career politician controlled by the far left. Abortion, taxes, Hunter Biden, China, “environmental extremists” — the hits kept coming, in a clear bid to energize the Republican base. Campaigns always exaggerate, but I think we should take note that many speakers completely misrepresented Mr. Biden’s positions in service of trying to make the case for Mr. Trump. To offer one example, Mr. Biden has explicitly said he opposes defunding the police, notwithstanding what Eric Trump said. Jenny: Absolutely. There were dozens of mentions of communism and socialism — which Mr. Biden is nowhere near embracing. And, worth noting, very little talk of the tens of thousands who have died from the coronavirus (which several speakers referred to as the “Chinese virus”) or the millions who have lost their jobs in the last six months. It was a night predicated on remembering the country before the pandemic. TRANSCRIPT I’m Cissie Graham Lynch, and I’m honored to speak to you tonight about something that is so important to all of us: our faith. As Americans, we know the first line of the First Amendment protects our freedom of religion. But what we often forget, the actual words are “free exercise of religion.” That means living out our faith in our daily lives, in our schools, in our jobs, and yes, even in the public square. Our founders did not envision a quiet, hidden faith. They fought to ensure that the voices of faith were always welcomed — not silenced, not bullied. So in the words of my grandfather Billy Graham, let us stand for political freedom, moral freedom, religious freedom and the rights of all Americans. And let’s never give in to those who would attempt to take it from us. Jenny: We heard a lot about God and faith tonight. White evangelicals, of course, remain some of the president’s most steadfast supporters. We heard from Cissie Graham Lynch, a granddaughter of the Rev. Billy Graham, the famed preacher. (In case you’ve forgotten: Late last year the editor of Christianity Today, which Mr. Graham founded, published a blistering essay calling for Mr. Trump’s removal from the White House.) We also heard from many other speakers who implicitly suggested that Mr. Trump is uniquely chosen to expand faith and religion in the country. Adam: Maybe even more than implicitly. That was done in direct ways — the repeated invocations of God — and in less direct ways, such as when Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, talked (from Jerusalem!) about Mr. Trump having moved the Israeli Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, an important goal for evangelicals. There was much discussion of abortion rights, a point of difference between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump. Religion has not been a major part of the president’s life, though I’m not sure that would be clear to anyone watching Night 2 of the convention. “God has blessed us,” his daughter Tiffany said in her speech. Jenny: When Melania Trump spoke, she claimed that her husband was the first to speak about religious freedom at the United Nations. But Barack Obama did so, too, as had other presidents before him. Adam: The timing of this was somewhat awkward: On the same day, Jerry Falwell Jr., one of Mr. Trump’s top evangelical supporters, resigned as president and chancellor of Liberty University. In a sex scandal. TRANSCRIPT My father has made me believe that America can truly be great again. If you care about living your life without restraints, about rebelling against those who would suppress your voice, and building your American dream, then the choice in this election is clear. A vote for my father, Donald J. Trump, is a vote to uphold our American ideals. Be true to yourself, and stay true to the dream of America. In closing, I’d like to speak directly to my father. I miss working alongside you every single day, but I’m damn proud to be on the front lines of this fight. I’m proud of what you are doing for this country. I’m proud to show my children what their grandfather is fighting for. Dad, let’s make Uncle Robert very proud this week. Let’s go get another four years. I love you very much. I’m here because we need my husband to be our president and commander in chief for four more years. He is what is best for our country. [music] [applause] Adam: One of the dominant themes of the night was Mr. Trump’s family: His wife, Melania, and two of his children, Tiffany and Eric, spoke. (Another son, Donald Jr., spoke yesterday.) The first lady spoke at a bells-and-whistles ceremony in the newly refurbished White House Rose Garden — which she refurbished — in front of an invited audience. (There were not many masks visible, if you were wondering.) It ended with Mr. Trump getting up, gazing at his wife and kissing her in front of the cameras as they exited stage right for the White House. This was clearly an effort to humanize the president. Donald Trump Jr. was not effusive in talking about his father on Monday, but Eric and Tiffany Trump certainly were. I don’t think most Americans have seen that. Do you think it worked? Jenny: Maybe, if we judge by exposure, but we didn’t hear any warm and fuzzy stories. Most Americans have rarely seen Tiffany, who spoke about graduating from law school this year in an I-feel-your-pain speech. A lot of it seemed to be about relating to regular people (perhaps a stretch for the family members of a self-proclaimed billionaire?). Melania talked about being just another mom struggling with how to teach her son about technology and bullying (but didn’t mention her husband’s penchant for aggressive tweeting). And Eric ended his speech with an impassioned declaration of adoration for his father. But in some ways, it was an acknowledgment of one of the president’s political weaknesses: an image of being aloof and uncaring. Adam: Be best! The speech from Donald Trump Jr. seemed more about Mr. Biden than his father (and keep in mind, he was thinking of his own political career as he presented himself to this Republican audience as the heir to the Trump political dynasty). The other children seemed to mix attacks on Democrats with love for their father. Jenny: That’s right. Eric and Tiffany Trump delivered the same kind of message about a looming dystopia under a Democratic administration, while the first lady focused on empathy (one of Mr. Biden’s primary selling points). Mrs. Trump, we should note, probably spoke more about the impact of the coronavirus than all the other speakers combined. TRANSCRIPT I don’t always agree with him. But our occasional policy differences are far outweighed by our significant agreements. But more important than simple agreement is accomplishment. President Trump gets things done. When some in Congress wanted a so-called revenue-neutral tax plan, Donald Trump and I worked together to make sure that it was a true tax cut. I’m supporting President Trump because he believes, as I do, that a strong America cannot fight endless wars. We must not continue to leave our blood and treasure in Middle East quagmires. Adam: You know what was striking about seeing Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky getting a spot on the convention stage (or whatever you want to call it)? It was a reminder of how few elected Republican leaders we have seen so far in this convention. I don’t think it’s a deliberate strategic exercise; instead, it is a reminder of how the Republican Party has been completely taken over by President Trump. Jenny: Didn’t Mr. Paul criticize Mr. Trump once or twice, way back when? I seem to recall the phrase “delusional narcissist and orange-faced windbag,” along with “fake conservative” and “bully.” Oh, but that was 2016, when Mr. Paul was trying to make his own way to the White House. Tonight, it was: “When I first met him, I recall being struck by how down to earth he was. He seemed like a normal guy.” Adam: Mr. Paul is one of the best examples of how Mr. Trump has vanquished his Republican enemies. As you noted, he was once one of Mr. Trump’s harshest critics. But he was all roses and wine tonight. And he did what the president wanted: He carried the brunt of the attacks against Mr. Biden. I think it’s fair to say that he has cemented his position in the Trump empire (as much as anyone is able to do that). But one word did not cross his lips. Can you guess what it is? Jenny: Pandemic? Adam. Close: Covid-19. And it’s particularly noteworthy because Mr. Paul learned he had the disease a little while back. I thought there was a chance he might talk about his experience and how he recovered, but I guess not. It looks like Monday was Covid night. TRANSCRIPT I’m Mike Pompeo. I’m speaking to you from beautiful Jerusalem, looking out over the Old City. I have a big job — as Susan’s husband and Nick’s dad. Susan and Nick are more safe and their freedoms more secure because President Trump has put his “America First” vision into action. It may not have made him popular in every foreign capital, but it’s worked. The president, too, moved the U.S. embassy to this very city of God, Jerusalem, the rightful capital of the Jewish homeland. And just two weeks ago, the president brokered a historic peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. This is the deal that our grandchildren will read about in their history books. You know, as a soldier, I saw firsthand people desperate to flee to freedom. The way each of us can best ensure our freedoms is by electing leaders who don’t just talk but who deliver. Jenny: Again, tell me if I slept through political history. But have we ever had a panoramic view of Jerusalem during a political convention? Or a sitting secretary of state speaking? Both? Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took the opportunity to boast about the Trump administration’s decision to move the American Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which was celebrated in the evangelical community. So we have a twofer: the erasing of government and political boundaries and a doubling down on religious faith as a voting imperative. Adam: Plus those nice views of the Holy City at dusk (or dawn?). On a night of line-crossing, that might have been — well, no. I don’t think anything takes the cake. But it was shocking. I’m looking at it and trying to imagine Henry Kissinger agreeing to that? James Baker? Thomas Jefferson? OK, I’ll stop. And with that, good night. In an abrupt swerve from the dire tone of the convention’s first night, President Trump was hailed by speakers on Tuesday as a friend to women and a champion of criminal justice reform.
