By Jill Cowan Good morning. If there’s one thing California’s electorate can teach us, it’s that — even in a deep blue state like ours — it’s unwise to make generalizations about voters from any community. Exhibit A: Latinos. My colleague Jennifer Medina has spent much of the past year talking to and writing about many of the 32 million eligible Latino voters across the country. Most recently, she explored why Hispanic evangelical voters have found themselves politically homeless and how, for some Latino men, the president has a macho appeal. (She also hosted this episode of The Daily about Arizona’s divided Latino vote.) I asked Jenny more about what she’s learned: What do you see as the most persistent misconceptions about Latino voters? First, and this can’t be overstated: Let’s get rid of the notion of the sleeping giant. What this cycle has made clear is that Latinos are very eager to engage with campaigns that are ready to engage with them. We saw this with the Sanders campaign during the primary, especially in California and Nevada, where Latinos helped fuel his victory. But we are also seeing evidence of that with the Trump campaign — more on that in a second.
