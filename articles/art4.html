Voters should focus on policy and character. By Charles M. Blow Opinion Columnist Donald Trump is the oldest person ever elected president. If Joe Biden wins in November he will break Trump’s record. Both men are in their seventies, and this week their health re-emerged in the presidential race in major ways. First, we learned from a forthcoming book by my colleague Michael Schmidt, that when Donald Trump made his mysterious, unscheduled visit to Walter Reed military hospital last fall, Vice President Mike Pence was put on standby to assume the presidency. As Schmidt wrote: “In reporting for this book, I learned that in the hours leading up to Trump’s trip to the hospital, word went out in the West Wing for the vice president to be on standby to take over the powers of the presidency temporarily if Trump had to undergo a procedure that would have required him to be anesthetized.” This was apparently not necessary, but we still don’t know the reason for the visit. At the time, the White House said that Trump was getting a head start on his annual physical, but that never made sense. Mike Pence said that he didn’t recall being put on standby on that particular day, as if that was a thing one would forget. He said he was always on standby to replace the boss. What medical need could the president have had that could not be handled by medics in the White House? CNN’s Sanjay Gupta said after Schmidt’s revelation was made public that such a hospital visit typically “comes down to two issues: Something to do with the brain or something to do with the heart.” This is particularly worrisome since Trump has recently displayed odd behavior like struggling to lift a glass of water, walking gingerly down a ramp and repeatedly slurring his words.
