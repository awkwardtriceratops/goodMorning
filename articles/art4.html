But cheaper flights are one benefit. By Bill Saporito Mr. Saporito is a contributor to the editorial board. The airline industry, as we have known it for decades, is over. A restructured industry will be landing soon, changing how we fly and what we fly. The summer travel season so crucial to the industry’s profits was largely erased, as new coronavirus hot spots spread to Southern and Western states. The best-case scenario now is that domestic airline traffic returns to 50 percent of its pre-pandemic level by 2021, according to Boyd Group, an industry consultant. On Oct. 1, the day funding and industry protections embedded in the CARES Act expired, the major airlines began to carry out the service changes and layoffs that they had signaled were coming all summer: Industrywide, direct layoffs passed 50,000 as Congress dithered over more economic relief. American Airlines let go of 19,000 employees; United another 13,000. The commuter airline ExpressJet shut down, causing a loss of 2,800 jobs, making it the third regional airline to fall victim to the pandemic. The decline in air travel has, unsurprisingly, had devastating effects on tourism. Just before the airline layoffs were announced, the Walt Disney Company cast off 28,000 cast members in its theme park division, mostly in Florida and California. Tourists are still reluctant to fly to Tomorrowland, or Las Vegas, despite expansive airline safety and cleaning protocols and assurances that passengers have less than a 1 percent chance of catching the virus on a commercial jet. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes on its website, “social distancing is difficult on crowded flights, and sitting within six feet of others, sometimes for hours, may increase your risk of getting Covid-19.” Have a nice flight, though. Airlines must now downsize, rationalize and spruce up every piece of their operations. What does this mean for us customers? A mixed bag, but once the industry shrinks to fit the current demand it will lose the ability to expand quickly again should an economic rebound take place. So expect a permanent reduction in the number of flights for the next year. On the plus side, jet fleets will get younger (with Wi-Fi and outlets on almost every plane), and we may benefit from less fee-grubbing and a more consumer friendly travel experience. Pricing should remain competitive because carriers will still have way more capacity than they do demand and they need to generate cash. Jet fleets are being drastically overhauled. Say goodbye to wide-bodies such as the famed Boeing 747s, which first made transoceanic flight affordable, and Airbus’s giant A380s. These jets are too expensive to run if they’re not full, and few people are eager to share airspace with 300 to 500 other passengers. It’s time to say hello again to the infamous Boeing 737 Max. With its initial flaws that led to two deadly crashes in 2019 now addressed — and the Federal Aviation Administration paying close attention to its re-certification — the 737 Max may be the safest jet in the skies when it returns later this year. For the airlines, the Max is too efficient, and expensive, to remain parked, and it offers a lower carbon footprint as well. In bad news, some airlines are eliminating service to smaller cities. American, for instance, is ending service to 15 cities, including Dubuque, Iowa, and Roswell, N.M., leaving some of these markets without direct air service, which will hurt them economically. In other places, carriers are reducing flights rather than eliminating the routes. In good news, the passenger pecking order has flipped. Airlines have traditionally catered to corporate passengers who fly often, pay higher average fares and benefit most from frequent flier programs. Those suits are now trapped in videoconferences, wishing they were in business class, going somewhere, anywhere. Winning over leisure travelers, who have long been treated like revenue extraction objects, has become a quarterly goal and one reason some carriers have dropped those infuriating change fees. (Maybe checked luggage fees will follow.) The carriers have also granted status extensions in their frequent flier programs and removed award travel fees. “We now think about a customer as a customer, not as a series of transactions,” said Vasu Raja, American’s chief revenue officer, in a recent presentation. (Well, thanks, Mr. Raja. I feel less like baggage already.) The shift to leisure customers also means more flights to vacation spots this winter. Jet Blue, for instance, added six new routes to the Caribbean. American just added Indianapolis to Cancun, Mexico. None of this will matter if consumers continue to lack confidence in their safety and governments continue to erect a barrage of ever-changing quarantine screens. The World Economic Forum, in conjunction with The Commons Project, a nonprofit, has proposed a Covid-19 “passport” of sorts called CommonPass — “a shared global framework to allow individuals to document their COVID-19 status electronically and present it when they board a plane or cross a border.” Heathrow Airport has begun a trial with several airlines. The initial goal is to create a Covid-tested corridor between London and New York to revive international travel. That’s no small challenge, since London-New York is the busiest air corridor on the planet. Speaking on a webcast for Travel Weekly, Heathrow’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, explained, “If we can’t make it work on that route, we’re not going to be able to make it work.” In the United States, where airlines struggled to get all passengers to wear masks, a mandatory preflight test might create more conflict, or even a disincentive for some. And the Federal Aviation Administration, which typically does everything it can to steer clear of controversy, is unlikely to push for a mandate. So the airlines themselves may have to undertake that mission themselves, to save some of the roughly 75 million global tourism jobs now at risk. Many of us may still remember the time when airline cabins were divided into smoking and nonsmoking sections, until we collectively realized how insane that was. If this industry is going to aspire toward virus-free flights, it may mean that removing your shoes, taking out your laptop and stepping into the X-ray machine may soon be followed by a cheek or nose swab. Surely, in the end, that’s a small price to pay. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.
