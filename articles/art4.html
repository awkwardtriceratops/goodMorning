Can we just get to 2021?” By Susan E. Rice Ms. Rice is a former national security adviser. Finishing up the dinner dishes one evening last week, I was jolted by a song on my teenage daughter’s playlist. In the radio-edited version of “F2020,” Avenue Beat delivers a captivating chorus, followed by: “I am kinda done. Can we just get to 2021?” Turning to my daughter, I joked, “Shouldn’t that be a sort of anthem for this year?” “For many in my generation, it already is,” she replied. It’s only October, and 2020 feels like the longest, most brutal year in memory. There are now almost 215,000 lives lost in the United States, vulnerable children missing months of education and tens of millions of people facing economic devastation. President Trump’s willful failure to confront Covid-19 has brutalized our country. If that is not enough, Mr. Trump continuously stokes division, fear and hatred in this moment of historic racial reckoning, while running roughshod over the rule of law, and our democratic norms and institutions. Almost every day, it seems something crazier happens than on the day before, further straining our collective credulity.
