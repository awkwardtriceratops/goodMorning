By Emily Cochrane, Hailey Fuchs, Kenneth P. Vogel and Jessica Silver-Greenberg WASHINGTON — Louis DeJoy’s move to halt changes that were viewed as a threat to mail-in voting did little to quell the outcry over his leadership as postmaster general, with lawmakers calling on Wednesday for his removal and one top Democrat demanding more answers about the secretive process that led to a major Trump donor running the Postal Service. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, called on the Postal Service board of governors to release information about the selection process that resulted in Mr. DeJoy’s appointment in May, saying that the changes made under his watch underscored the need for more details. In a separate letter to Mr. DeJoy, Mr. Schumer also requested more information about the changes that had been put in place and which ones would be suspended. Mr. DeJoy, who will face lawmakers at two separate hearings in the coming days, said on Tuesday that he would suspend cost-cutting and operational changes that have slowed mail delivery and fueled worries about mail-in voting in the November election. But Mr. DeJoy did not commit to reversing changes already put in place, including the removal of hundreds of mail-sorting machines, some of which have already been destroyed, according to union officials and postal workers. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who spoke with Mr. DeJoy on Wednesday, said in a statement that the postmaster general “frankly admitted that he had no intention of replacing the sorting machines, blue mailboxes and other key mail infrastructure that have been removed, and that plans for adequate overtime, which is critical for the timely delivery of mail, are not in the works.” Lawmakers plan to question Mr. DeJoy, who previously ran a logistics and transportation company, at a Senate committee hearing on Friday and at a House oversight hearing on Monday. House lawmakers are also expected to vote Saturday on legislation that would reverse the changes put into place by Mr. DeJoy, prevent any further changes before the end of the pandemic and provide $25 billion for the beleaguered agency, with $15 billion of that going to the Postal Service Office of Inspector General. Top House Republicans, who conferred on Wednesday by phone with Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, are formally urging members of the conference to vote against the measure, according to three people familiar with the discussions. Close to 100 Democrats called for Mr. DeJoy’s removal from the position of postmaster general, writing to the agency’s board of governors that Mr. DeJoy “has already done considerable damage to the institution, and we believe his conflicts of interest are insurmountable.” Mr. Schumer, along with other Democrats and some Republicans, have expressed concerns about the changes being put in place that have resulted in some Americans going days or weeks without receiving mail, including critical medications and Social Security checks. In a letter sent Wednesday to Robert M. Duncan, the chairman of the board of governors, Mr. Schumer demanded more details about Mr. DeJoy’s selection, saying that the board had repeatedly denied lawmakers’ requests to gain access to that information. Mr. Schumer said the postal board had blocked lawmakers from questioning the firm involved in the selection of Mr. DeJoy, Russell Reynolds, by refusing to release the firm from a nondisclosure agreement. Mr. Schumer said that his office had sought a briefing from Kimberly Archer, a leader of the firm’s global nonprofit practice, and information from the firm so “Congress could satisfy its oversight obligations to better understand the selection of Mr. DeJoy,” but that the postal board in July had deemed much of the information sought by lawmakers to be confidential. “This administration has repeatedly pointed to the role of Russell Reynolds to defend the selection of a Republican megadonor with no prior postal experience as postmaster general while at the same time blocking the ability of Congress to obtain briefings from the firm and concealing the role of Secretary Mnuchin and the White House in its search process,” Mr. Schumer wrote, referring to Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. A spokesman for the Postal Service directed inquiries about the search to a news release announcing Mr. DeJoy’s selection and to previous remarks by a Postal Service governor, John M. Barger, who has said candidates were extensively vetted. In an interview, Mr. Barger, who spearheaded the search, said that the board’s decision to select Mr. DeJoy was unanimous and included the board’s sole Democrat at the time, Ron A. Bloom. “Bloom was a strong yes,” Mr. Barger said. One Democratic member of the board, David C. Williams, resigned in April, shortly before the announcement of Mr. DeJoy’s selection, over concerns that the Postal Service was becoming increasingly politicized by the Trump administration, according to two people familiar with his thinking. Mr. Barger said he was “surprised” by the resignation and had “never heard an objection from David Williams about any of the candidates, other than the ones we did not hire.” “I don’t recall him ever having objected to anything,” Mr. Barger said, “or I would have asked him why. And it would have been considered.” Mr. Williams is expected to testify on Thursday before lawmakers from the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Mounting pressure prompted Mr. DeJoy to backpedal on many of his changes, saying post office hours would not be shortened, mail-processing equipment and mailboxes would remain, and overtime would continue to be approved, as needed. But state officials, postal workers and union representatives said some damage has already been done. Hundreds of sorting machines, union officials and workers said, have already been destroyed.
