By Hwaida Saad and Carlotta Gall BEIRUT, Lebanon — Russian war planes struck a camp of Turkish-backed rebel fighters in northwestern Syria on Monday, killing dozens of Syrian fighters as well as civilians harvesting olives nearby, according to a rebel spokesman, in the bloodiest surge in violence since a cease-fire came into effect seven months ago. The strike targeted the group Faylaq al-Sham, whose base is near several refugee camps in the heavily populated province of Idlib. Several million people live in the province, many of them displaced from other parts of Syria by the country’s nine-year civil war. Early reports put the toll at 34 dead and 70 wounded, but the death toll quickly rose to 60 with news of civilians killed outside the camp. Video footage from the scene showed the bodies of at least a dozen fighters wrapped in blankets on the floor of a clinic.
