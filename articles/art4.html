It is unclear which companies will ultimately secure a deal, though TikTok will likely make a decision in the coming days, they said. In a statement, Walmart said, “We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of U.S. TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of U.S. government regulators.”
