By Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman WASHINGTON — President Trump pressed Senate Republicans on Saturday to confirm his choice to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg “without delay,” setting up a momentous battle sure to inflame the campaign even as party leaders weighed whether they could force a confirmation vote before the election on Nov. 3. Mr. Trump appears likely to nominate a successor to Justice Ginsburg this coming week after her death on Friday, a selection that if confirmed would shift the Supreme Court to the right for years. But with some Republican senators balking, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader from Kentucky, was canvassing to figure out whether he had enough votes to rush a confirmation in the next six weeks. “We were put in this position of power and importance to make decisions for the people who so proudly elected us, the most important of which has long been considered to be the selection of United States Supreme Court Justices,” Mr. Trump wrote Saturday morning on Twitter. “We have this obligation, without delay!” He addressed the message to “@GOP” but did not define “without delay” or explicitly demand a Senate decision before voters cast their ballots. .@GOP We were put in this position of power and importance to make decisions for the people who so proudly elected us, the most important of which has long been considered to be the selection of United States Supreme Court Justices. We have this obligation, without delay! Mr. Trump spoke with Mr. McConnell on Friday night and identified his three top choices as Judges Amy Coney Barrett of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago, Barbara Lagoa of the 11th Circuit in Atlanta and Amul R. Thapar of the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, according to two people familiar with the discussion. The front-runner appeared to be Judge Barrett, a favorite of anti-abortion conservatives who was a finalist for a previous Supreme Court vacancy when the president reportedly said he was “saving her for Ginsburg.” Mr. McConnell moved to stave off defections in his conference by sending a letter late Friday night to Republican senators urging them to “keep your powder dry” and not “prematurely lock yourselves into a position you may later regret.” At least two Republicans have made clear that they would not support jamming through a nominee so close to a presidential election, meaning Mr. McConnell, with a 53-to-47 majority and Vice President Mike Pence as a tiebreaker, could afford to lose only one more. With 45 days until the election, some Republican strategists said that it would make more sense for the president to name a choice now but wait for a Senate vote until a lame-duck session afterward. That way, Republicans who have soured on Mr. Trump because of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 Americans or for other reasons would have an incentive to turn out to vote. Exit polls showed after the 2016 election that 26 percent of Mr. Trump’s voters considered the Supreme Court the most important issue that year, when there was also a vacant court seat, compared with just 18 percent of Hillary Clinton’s supporters. The president has long considered his record of conservative judicial appointments one of his strongest election arguments to motivate his base. But some Republicans like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas were agitating for a quick vote, arguing that a potentially messy pandemic election with the president already challenging the legitimacy of mail-in voting could wind up at the Supreme Court much as the 2000 election did. A short-handed eight-member court could deadlock at 4 to 4 if Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. sided with the three remaining liberals, as he has on a few occasions, whereas another Trump-appointed justice would cement the conservative hold on the bench. “We cannot have Election Day come and go with a 4-4 court,” Mr. Cruz said Friday night on Fox News. “A 4-4 court that is equally divided cannot decide anything. And I think we risk a constitutional crisis if we do not have a nine-justice Supreme Court, particularly when there is such a risk of a contested election.” An all-out Supreme Court confirmation fight in the middle of an election or even in a lame-duck session would fit in with a year of seismic events that have rocked the United States. The year started with only the third presidential impeachment trial in history, followed by a once-in-a-century pandemic, the most devastating economic collapse since the Great Depression and an eruption of racial strife that brought protesters into the streets and at times resulted in violent clashes.
