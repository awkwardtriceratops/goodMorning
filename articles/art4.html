Stretched Hard to Defend Trump on Race and Gender<br></h1><p id="artcont">Never before has a convention by a major party felt compelled to call such a diverse array of speakers to defend the character of a sitting president. By Adam Nagourney and Sydney Ember The Republican convention this week marked an extraordinary effort to recast President Trump’s image on issues of race and gender, with the party stretching to find African-Americans who would testify that Mr. Trump is not racist, and lining up women to describe him as sensitive and empathetic — qualities he rarely displays in public. This vouching for Mr. Trump, as he was nominated for a second term, was without precedent. Never before has a convention by either major party felt compelled to call such a diverse array of speakers to defend the character of a sitting president. And it was done with a crucial political goal in mind: making a divisive leader appear more palatable to white moderate voters, who have turned against the Trump-led G.O.P. in recent elections, while also trying to peel away some nonwhite voters from Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee. Some polls indicate that Mr. Trump has made slight gains among minority voters over the past three years. A shift of even a sliver of voters toward him — or a strategy that dampens minority turnout by demonizing Mr. Biden and presenting Mr. Trump as acceptable — could make a difference in critical states like North Carolina and Arizona. “Many on the other side love to incite division by claiming that President Trump is a racist,” Ben Carson, the housing secretary and the only African-American in the cabinet, said at the convention on Thursday night, shortly before Mr. Trump delivered his acceptance speech. “They could not be more wrong.” Herschel Walker, a former football star and longtime friend of the president’s, said he was offended that anyone might hold that negative view of Mr. Trump. “I take it as a personal insult that people would think I've had a 37-year friendship with a racist,” he said. The Republicans were so intent on finding people of color to appear onscreen that they seem to have put a number of them before convention cameras without their knowledge, including several immigrants participating in a naturalization ceremony and three New York public housing residents. And for a convention focused on race in America under Mr. Trump, there was strikingly little talk about the crises facing racial minorities in the nation. There were few mentions of Jacob Blake, the Black man shot by a police officer in Kenosha, Wis., or George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black victims of police violence, episodes that have sparked a summer of protests across the country. There was scant attention paid to the racial disparities in the pandemic, with death rates that are devastating minority families and communities across the United States. Mr. Trump’s own words at the convention were more hard-edge than empathetic, as he sought to rally his conservative base as well as reach out to moderates. He mentioned Kenosha only as part of a litany of “Democrat-run cities” that he claimed had been troubled by “rioting, looting, arson and violence.” His ominous warnings — “no one will be safe in Biden’s America” — recalled the appeals to blue-collar white voters used by Richard M. Nixon and George Wallace. “This week was symbolic gestures and hostile rhetoric,” said the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, the longtime civil rights leader. “There’s no African-American in the inner circle of the Republican Party,” Mr. Jackson said. “They keep referring to themselves as the party of Lincoln — that’s not true.” How Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden navigate issues of race and gender, and how voters respond, looms as a critical test of the coming 10-week general election campaign. The nationwide protests create a particularly polarizing backdrop for both candidates, as they struggle to accommodate demands from the ideological wings of their parties — defunding the police on the left, and a fierce crackdown on demonstrators on the right — while not alienating moderate voters. It will be  weeks before it is possible to judge how effective the Republican convention strategy was, and some Democrats argued that Mr. Trump is too defined in the American consciousness to succeed with this kind of reinvention, especially this late in the contest. According to a Pew Research poll released two weeks ago, Mr. Biden led Mr. Trump among Black voters by a margin of 89 percent to 8 percent. Among women, he led by 56 percent to 42 percent. “This is not reparable,” said Joel Benenson, a Democratic pollster who was a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump’s opponent in 2016. “No credible person who pays attention to these issues, and I include those people who spoke at the convention, can seriously believe that Donald Trump doesn’t harbor a series of racist attitudes.” Still, recent polling indicates that Mr. Trump is performing somewhat better than he was four years ago among African-Americans and Hispanics. He even maintained his gains after the death of Mr. Floyd, when national politics focused on issues that might have been expected to erode his support in Black and Hispanic communities, like the president’s handling of race, criminal justice and protesters. Instead, Mr. Trump appeared to lose ground among white voters. To that end, at the convention, Mr. Trump and other Republicans disparaged Mr. Biden’s record on racial justice and his sponsorship of the 1994 crime bill, and promoted the president’s support of school choice and federal funding for historically Black colleges, both issues that polled well among Black voters.
