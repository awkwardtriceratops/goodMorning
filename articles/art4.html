High Court<br></h1><p id="artcont">Fabiana Pierre-Louis, 39, would also be the only Black judge currently seated on the state’s Supreme Court. By Tracey Tully If approved on Monday by the State Senate, Fabiana Pierre-Louis will become the first Black woman on New Jersey’s highest court, serving at a time when the state and the country remain deeply divided over racial and economic injustice. She would also be the only Black judge currently seated on the New Jersey Supreme Court. Ms. Pierre-Louis, 39, a former assistant U.S. attorney in New Jersey, was nominated by Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, to the post in June, as protesters across the nation, outraged by the death of George Floyd while in police custody, were demanding criminal justice reform. The daughter of Haitian immigrants who grew up in working-class Irvington, N.J., Ms. Pierre-Louis said in an interview soon after her nomination that she was aware her background would play a role in the way she approached cases. “Having a perspective and understanding of what it is like to live in Irvington, or other places,” she added, “it just informs how you experience many things in life.” “It’s really important to represent the community from the top down,” she said. Ms. Pierre-Louis, a partner at a private law firm who lives with her husband and their two young sons in Mount Laurel, N.J., spoke Creole before she learned English. She moved as a child from Brooklyn to Irvington, a northern New Jersey township just west of Newark, where her family bought a house. Her father owned and drove a cab, she said, and her mother drove a van that shuttled patients to and from a New York City hospital. In the interview, she said that as a judge she would “look with a very critical eye at cases involving search warrants and whether there was probable cause.” When asked about the protests that followed Mr. Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis, she said, “I think that what people are seeking is a society where everyone is treated fairly and justly and equally under the law.” Her confirmation hearing began at 11 a.m. on Monday. Mr. Murphy has reappointed two sitting justices, but Ms. Pierre-Louis is his first nomination to the high court, which has not had a Black justice since former Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, refused in 2010 to extend the term of John E. Wallace Jr. As a young graduate of Rutgers Law School in Camden, N.J., Ms. Pierre-Louis worked as a law clerk for Justice Wallace. If approved, Ms. Pierre-Louis would replace Justice Walter F. Timpone, who will reach the mandatory retirement age of 70 later this year. It is not her first time breaking barriers. As an assistant federal prosecutor, she was the first woman of color to hold the posts of attorney-in-charge in both the Camden and Trenton offices of the United States attorney for New Jersey. She said her humble upbringing and immigrant roots had shaped her point of view. “It’s part of who I am,” she said. “It’s part of my identity.” Senator Nicholas P. Scutari, the Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he originally thought Ms. Pierre-Louis was too young for the position, being at least 20 years younger than the next youngest person on the bench. But, he said, interviews and a background check convinced him that she was more than ready. “I haven’t found one person to say one thing negative about this nominee,” Senator Scutari said, “and that is hard.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
