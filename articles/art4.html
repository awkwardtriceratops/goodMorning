RIGHT NOW The largest group of fires, called the L.N.U. Lightning Complex, has consumed more than 219,000 acres. TRANSCRIPT You know, just trying to make some fire breaks, do what we can. But with this wind and the hot spots, shoot this could all be for nothing. It just could be an exercise in futility because you know, all it takes is one spark to jump. I mean, that house wasn’t burning half an hour ago. Neither was that. Deep into its latest battle against ballooning wildfires, Northern California faces another day under siege, with the huge blazes ripping across the region still growing and still almost completely uncontained. Five deaths have been linked to the fires, which have forced more than 60,000 people out of their homes, filled the skies with thick smoke and consumed hundreds of homes. The fires, burning across more than 500,000 acres, were ignited by lightning during an extraordinary period of more than 10,800 lightning strikes over several days, which caused hundreds of fires, including nearly a dozen major ones. As flames raced toward homes this week, smoke worsened an already oppressive heat wave, lightning strikes sparked new fires, the electrical grid struggled to keep up with demand, and the coronavirus threatened illness in evacuation shelters. At least four bodies were recovered Thursday, the authorities said, including three from a burned house in a rural area in Napa County and a man found in Solano County. On Wednesday, a helicopter pilot on a water-dropping mission died in a crash in Fresno County. Firefighters have struggled to contain the largest fires. One group of fires, called the L.N.U. Lightning Complex, doubled in size Wednesday and nearly doubled again on Thursday, growing to 219,067 acres as it stretched across Napa and four surrounding counties. The fires in that grouping have destroyed nearly 500 homes and other buildings, many of them in Vacaville, and are responsible for the four civilian deaths as well as four injuries, according to Cal Fire, the state’s fire agency. Firefighters said those blazes are 7 percent contained. Maps showing the extents of the major fires in Northern California. A combination of fires known as the C.Z.U. Lightning Complex has forced more than 64,600 people in San Mateo and Santa Cruz Counties to evacuate, including the entire University of California, Santa Cruz campus, which was placed under a mandatory evacuation order on Thursday night. The fires have grown to 50,000 acres, consumed at least 50 buildings and are completely uncontained. East of Silicon Valley, the S.C.U. Lightning Complex, a group of about 20 fires, had spread across 229,968 acres — largely in less populous areas — and was 10 percent contained as of Friday morning, Cal Fire said. Its proximity to San Jose had led to some evacuation orders, and two emergency workers and two civilians have been injured. Gov. Gavin Newsom, in a video message for the Democratic National Convention on Thursday, called the state’s wildfires an “unprecedented challenge” and linked them to global warming. “If you are in denial about climate change, come to California,” he said.
