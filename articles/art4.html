By Austin Ramzy, Tiffany May and Elaine Yu HONG KONG — China moved on Wednesday to quash one of the last vestiges of democracy and dissent in Hong Kong, forcing the ouster of four pro-democracy lawmakers from their elected offices in a purge that prompted the rest of the opposition to vow to resign en masse. The departures will reshape the city’s political landscape, which has been upended since China imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong this summer that gave the authorities broad powers to crack down on any resistance. They mark the intensification of a campaign that has put Hong Kong’s global reputation as a bastion for laissez-faire regulation, freedom of speech and rule of law in jeopardy. The targeting of the democratically elected lawmakers comes at a time when the United States, which has recently protested China’s treatment of Hong Kong and imposed sanctions, is distracted by its own struggles over the American presidential election. In Hong Kong in recent months, the Beijing-backed authorities have arrested pro-democracy leaders and activists as they resolved to bring Hong Kong to heel and put an end to the protests that engulfed the semiautonomous Chinese territory for much of last year. They have challenged Hong Kong’s independent court system and put pressure on news outlets that strike a defiant tone. Their target on Wednesday was Hong Kong’s legislature, the Legislative Council, where a group of pro-democracy lawmakers have loudly argued that Beijing’s campaign threatens to erode Hong Kong’s status as a global, open city. Beijing officials moved on Wednesday to silence those voices, outlining broad powers that they had granted to their handpicked representatives in the Hong Kong government to remove lawmakers from office. City officials then ejected the four lawmakers — Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki, Kenneth Leung and Alvin Yeung — from the Legislative Council. Hours after their removal, the remaining 15 members of their bloc said they were stepping down in solidarity.
