Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Wednesday. Weather: Mixed sun and clouds, with a stray shower. High around 80. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Sept. 7 (Labor Day). Read about the amended regulations here. In mere weeks, New York City’s 1.1 million schoolchildren are set to return to classrooms part time. Reopening public schools on Sept. 10 would not only be crucial for vulnerable students but pivotal in helping to repair the pandemic-ravaged economy, as many parents would be able to return to work. Still, as we inch toward that date, principals, teachers and others are continuing to raise concerns about the threat of the coronavirus. Mayor Bill de Blasio may be the only big-city mayor attempting some in-person learning this fall, and now he’s facing mounting pressure to delay that plan. [Getting the virus under control in New York is only the first step to opening schools.] The city, no longer an epicenter of the pandemic, is planning a hybrid learning model, with students returning to school for a only few days each week to allow for social distancing. That plan has proved to be a logistical challenge. Principals, for instance, have said that they don’t know how many students will show up on Sept. 10 because there isn’t a deadline for families to opt in for some in-person classes or all-remote learning. So far, about 30 percent of families have said they would start the academic year remotely, but that number may change, making it almost impossible to plan class schedules and determine how many teachers schools will need. My colleague Eliza Shapiro, who covers education, wrote recently that the city’s biggest obstacle is time. Principals have only two work days in September to meet with teachers for staffing decisions, and questions about classroom ventilation and how to test students and faculty members for the coronavirus largely remain unanswered. “A delayed start to in-person classes is beginning to feel like more of a ‘when’ than an ‘if,’” she said. A school district outside of Phoenix temporarily canceled classes after teachers and staff members called out sick to protest in-person schooling. Near Oklahoma City, an infected student went to school before his 14-day quarantine was over, NBC News reported. Now, dozens of students there are in quarantine. In Cherokee County, Georgia, more than 2,000 students and staff members were ordered to quarantine because of large numbers of coronavirus cases. In Los Angeles — home to the nation’s second-largest school system, behind New York City — children started virtual classes on Monday. The district also has an ambitious program to test its 700,000 students and 75,000 employees for the virus. In New York, many out-of-state college students must quarantine in the state for 14 days before attending classes. That has left families scrambling to find arrangements to do so. Tanja Chevalier, whose daughter attends Syracuse University, was confused about what do when her home state, Illinois, was added to New York’s mandatory quarantine list. It was too late for her daughter to sign up for on-campus quarantine housing. “I don’t even know what moves to make,” Ms. Chevalier told my colleague Troy Closson. Elsewhere, The Times has identified more than 250 cases tied to Greek life at universities across the country. Fraternities have thrown parties, and sorority members at University of Alabama have filled bars. And at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, officials swiftly called off in-person classes because of outbreaks.
