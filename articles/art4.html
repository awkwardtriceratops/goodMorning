By Luke Broadwater and Hailey Fuchs WASHINGTON — She waited and waited for her mail-in ballot to arrive until — finally, maddeningly — she could wait no more. So this weekend, 25 days after election officials in Ohio say they mailed an absentee ballot that never arrived, Laura Ruch, 30, will leave her medical fellowship in Atlanta, board a plane against her better judgment and fly home to vote in person amid a pandemic. “It’s really frustrating,” said Ms. Ruch, who has called and emailed election officials repeatedly without receiving satisfying answers about what happened to her ballot. “If this is happening to me, it’s probably happening to lots of people.” In the final week of voting in the 2020 campaign, the worst fears about the Postal Service’s ability to handle the crush of election-season mail have not materialized, according to interviews this week with secretaries of state in battleground jurisdictions and election experts. “Generally speaking, we’re pleased with the service,” said Steve Simon, a Democrat who is the secretary of state in Minnesota, where he expects as many as 40 percent of voters to cast ballots by mail. But the Postal Service’s record in getting mail-in ballots to voters and then returning them to election authorities on time remains spotty and inconsistent enough to generate continuing concern and to leave some voters anxious and looking for last-minute ways to assure their votes will be counted. Figures reported by the service in court filings show that the nationwide figure for on-time delivery of mail ballots has bounced around this week, from 89 percent on Tuesday to 97 percent on Wednesday, amid wide variations in individual regions. The agency, which has cautioned against reading too much into daily fluctuations in performance, has designated election mail as its highest priority and defines on time as being delivered within one to three days. J. Remy Green, a lawyer who represents 17 mail-in voters in a lawsuit filed in federal court in New York, said that the Postal Service was performing much better than its low point this summer, but that figures showing more than 10 percent of ballots on a given day not being sorted in a timely way this week remained troublesome. “In that regard, 89 percent is quite shocking,” Mx. Green said. “You knew these were ballots and you only got them in 89 percent of the time? That’s wild.” Questions about whether mailed ballots will be received in time to be counted remain a flash point in the election and the subject of litigation that has repeatedly reached the Supreme Court this week. In the last several days, the justices have ruled that Wisconsin cannot extend its deadline for receiving absentee ballots but left in place for now Pennsylvania’s plan to allow an extra three days for ballots to come in and said North Carolina could provide up to nine extra days. The lingering concern about mail ballots also appears to have contributed to the surge in voters flocking to the polls to vote early and in person. More than 28 million people had already voted in person and more than 52 million mail ballots had been returned as of Thursday afternoon. Mail service in general in about 60 of 67 postal districts across the country remains consistently worse than it was before cost-cutting measures carried out in July by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy substantially slowed service. And in 10 districts — including ones crucial to the election’s outcome, such as Philadelphia, Detroit and northern Ohio — first-class mail performance is particularly slow, with more than 20 percent of mail delivered late. On Wednesday, the Postal Service reported that first-class mail in Philadelphia met the on-time delivery standard of one to three days for just 58 percent of deliveries, and in Detroit the number was even lower: 52 percent. Delivery rates dropped sharply in July after Mr. DeJoy, a Trump megadonor who was hired to bring in logistics expertise, pushed through the cost-cutting measures, including limiting overtime and late truck trips, to try to overhaul an agency suffering billion-dollar losses. Those changes prompted widespread complaints of medicine being delivered late and animals dying in packages amid a nationwide slowdown of mail. Mr. DeJoy’s orders came as Mr. Trump railed almost daily against the Postal Service and voting by mail, causing postal workers, voters and election experts alike to warn of a building crisis that could disenfranchise record numbers of Americans who will be casting ballots by mail in November because of the coronavirus outbreak. Delivery rates have rebounded some from their low in July but remain below on-time performance levels before Mr. DeJoy’s hiring. The improvement came after a series of court orders from judges across the country, in response to a dozen lawsuits filed against the Postal Service, forcing Mr. DeJoy to reverse his changes. One federal court ruling in New York, for instance, ordered the Postal Service to treat all election mail, including ballots, as first-class or priority mail; preapprove all overtime requested from Oct. 26 to Nov. 6, the peak times for election mail; and submit a plan to restore on-time delivery of mail to its highest level this year. The transition in leadership at the Postal Service prompted new “uncertainty” and “confusion” ahead of the election, said Michigan’s secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat. She added that the state installed drop boxes across municipalities, at least in part over concerns about sustained delays in mail delivery. Two weeks before Election Day, Ms. Benson began cautioning voters against returning their ballots by mail. In a separate suit against the Postal Service in Florida, lawyers representing the Service Employees International Union said they were particularly concerned about absentee voting in Miami-Dade County, where some 60 percent of mail ballots have yet to be returned before Tuesday’s deadline. Other battleground states, like North Carolina, have also reported that large numbers of mail ballots have yet to be returned. It was not clear whether the people who received those ballots had failed to send them back, left mailing them until the last minute or changed their plans and decided to vote in person.
