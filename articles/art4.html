By David Leonhardt Want to get The Morning by email? Here’s the sign-up. It really is possible to conduct a smooth election during a pandemic. The states that created a universal vote-by-mail system years ago, like Colorado and Oregon, have the easiest time doing so. But states without such a system can still avoid long voting lines, count ballots quickly and announce almost all results on election night, even when turnout is high and a virus is raging. That’s perhaps the most important lesson of this week’s primary in Massachusetts. Even though more than 1.5 million people voted, a record for a Democratic primary in the state, wait times at polling places were mostly short. And even though many people voted by mail, the results were available on election night. It was a contrast to the recent messes in Georgia (where lines lasted hours) and New York (where some results weren’t available for weeks). How did Massachusetts do so? Mostly by making an effort. In July, the state legislature passed an emergency bill that, among other things, mailed forms to all registered voters allowing them to request a mail-in ballot. Local officials set up dozens of ballot drop-off boxes, to reduce mail volume. The state loosened restrictions on who could serve as a poll worker — a particular problem since many existing workers are older and thus vulnerable to Covid-19. And the state allowed local officials to begin counting ballots as they arrived, rather than forcing them to wait until Election Day, as some states do. All of which indicates that states have the ability to let people vote safely and conveniently during a pandemic. Not every problem will be avoided. In very close races, for example, the outcome may not be known on election night, especially in states (unlike Massachusetts) that count all ballots postmarked by Election Day even if they arrive later. Of course, the closest races have always been uncertain for at least a few days, because of absentee ballots. In recent months, some states — like Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania  —  have made meaningful changes to their election rules to prepare for November. But many states have still not done enough, voting-rights experts say. And some politicians, including President Trump, have signaled that they are happy for voting to be difficult, so long as it helps them win. Those politicians are making a choice. Massachusetts — along with states that have universal vote-by-mail, like heavily Republican Utah, heavily Democratic Oregon and a few others — has shown what’s possible when public officials decide they want to protect Americans’ voting rights. In other campaign news: Joe Biden will travel to Kenosha, Wis., today to meet with the family of Jacob Blake, a Black man who was shot by a white police officer last month. Biden said yesterday that the officer should be charged with a crime. President Trump suggested that people in North Carolina stress-test the security of their elections systems by voting twice. Voting twice is illegal.
