By Richard Fausset DALTON, Ga. — On a recent Sunday morning in northwest Georgia, the Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, the South’s most prominent Black preacher and a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, was giving his stump speech, mixing a little laid-back pulpit humor with a searing, Jeremiah-like condemnation of Republicans in the age of Trump. He castigated them for neglecting “the poorest of the poor” while providing for “the richest of the rich.” He accused them of distracting the country with bigotry and division. He took care to poke fun at himself when he got carried away by emotion. (“Y’all be careful,” he said. “It’s Sunday.”) And he called, as he so often has, for the expansion of the Affordable Care Act. “I’ve read the Gospels a few times, and Jesus spent a lot of time healing the sick,” he said. “Even those with pre-existing conditions.” Polls show Dr. Warnock, 51, leading a crowded field in one of two Senate races in Georgia, running with the same playbook used by his close ally Stacey Abrams, who came tantalizingly close to an upset in the 2018 governor’s race by turning out minorities and younger voters in this demographically changing state. Dr. Warnock brings something else to the table. His position as the senior pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta gives him a direct connection to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who preached at the church, and, by extension, a central place in the nation’s ongoing civil rights conversation. But the Dr. King that animates Dr. Warnock’s campaign is not the anodyne figure sometimes portrayed in popular myth. Dr. Warnock considers himself a disciple of the flesh-and-blood Dr. King, who was not only an avatar of nonviolence, but also a rabble-rousing champion of the poor. And while Georgia, a state not too long removed from its Jim Crow past, may be ready to send a Black senator to Washington, is it willing to elect someone as unabashedly progressive as Dr. Warnock, even if he comes to politics as a man of God? So far, Dr. Warnock has benefited from the peculiar nature of his race, an open, multiparty contest that includes two Republicans who are currently splitting the conservative vote, Representative Doug Collins and Senator Kelly Loeffler. Matt Lieberman, a Democrat and the son of former Connecticut Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, has declined to drop out, despite pleas from numerous party leaders. All of this presents the possibility that no candidate will get a majority of the votes. That would trigger a January runoff, in which Dr. Warnock could face off against a single Republican, who would most likely consolidate conservative support. For now, though, Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Collins have been so busy attacking each other, and fighting to prove they are the more conservative candidate, that they have had little time to savage Dr. Warnock. That has left him free to define himself, emphasizing his up-from-poverty life story in  ads. In one early spot, he walks through the Savannah, Ga., housing project where he grew up with 11 brothers and sisters, and declares that children there today “have it harder now than I did back then. That’s got to change.” The ad also underscores his role at Ebenezer, part of his campaign’s full-on embrace of his life in the church — he calls his recent barnstorming campaign the “Rev Up the Vote” tour — and the leap he is trying to make from the pulpit to the Senate. “There is alway a distance between the ideals that we set and the reality of our lives,” he said in a brief interview after a campaign stop in Rome, Ga. “I think that’s the case of the church, and the covenant we have there, and that’s the case with respect to the American covenant.” Dr. Warnock found his religious calling early in life. Both of his parents were Pentecostal preachers — his father also worked salvaging abandoned cars — and his future vocation seemed so obvious in high school that his friends called him “Rev.” From there, he built a résumé that made his ascendance at Ebenezer seem preordained. He attended Morehouse College (Dr. King’s alma mater), then the Union Theological Seminary in New York City. There he earned advanced degrees and found a mentor in the Rev. Dr. James H. Cone, father of Black liberation theology, a system Dr. Cone once described as “an interpretation of the Christian Gospel from the experience and perspectives and lives of people who are at the bottom in society — the lowest economic and racial groups.”
