By Neil Gross Dr. Gross is a sociologist. In his speech last week in Pittsburgh, Joe Biden pushed back against Donald Trump’s mischaracterization of him as soft on crime and beholden to progressives intent on defunding or abolishing police departments. He pledged to work with mayors and governors to tamp down violence. He also vowed to make progress on police reform, invoking the names of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and Jacob Blake, and the cause of racial justice for which they have come to stand. Mr. Biden’s remarks were powerful. So far, however, he has not been very specific about his plans for reforming the police, beyond calling for federal oversight of troubled departments, stricter use-of-force standards and more money for community policing. While this no doubt reflects a political calculus that it is better to emphasize character than policy details, it also speaks to a sense of uncertainty in Democratic circles: How can the police be meaningfully reformed? There’s a substantial body of social science research that provides answers. Consider, as an example, research on how to reduce racial disparities in vehicle stops. Police officers in the United States pull over more than 19 million vehicles annually, making vehicle stops the No. 1 reason for contact between citizens and the police. Studies carried out over many years show that Black drivers are stopped disproportionately, a gap that cannot be accounted for by factors like differential driving behavior or greater poverty, which might translate into more cars on the road with equipment violations. Research also suggests that when Black drivers are pulled over, they tend to be treated less respectfully by the police and are given less leniency. The latest study to document these patterns comes from the computer scientist Emma Pierson and her colleagues at the Stanford Open Policing Project, who analyzed data on vehicle stops from 21 state patrol agencies and 35 city police departments from 2011 to 2018. The researchers found that Black drivers were stopped about 43 percent more often than their white counterparts, relative to their share of the population. To assess the role of police bias, the Stanford team compared stops that took place during daylight hours — when, at least in principle, it would be easier for officers to observe a driver’s skin color — to those that occurred at night. Stops of Black people were higher during the day. The study also found that Black and Latino drivers had their cars searched twice as often as white drivers, though Black and white drivers were about equally likely to be found with drugs or guns in their possession, and Latino drivers were less so. Frequent, intrusive vehicle stops aren’t just an inconvenience. Beyond being a source of legal and even physical peril, and something that can get in the way of economic opportunity (since many jobs require travel by car), such stops, according to other studies, are a potent reminder to Black Americans of all the ways in which the full rights of citizenship remain denied to them. A variety of “bias processes” influence the disproportional stops of Black drivers, according to research by the sociologist Patricia Warren and her colleagues. These include explicit racial profiling, implicit associations police officers may hold between blackness and criminality, and police deployment patterns in minority neighborhoods. But biases can be curbed through institutional redesign. One thing that would make a big difference would be to end “pretextual” traffic stops. These are stops where a police officer harbors some vague suspicion that a driver may be involved in criminal activity — a suspicion so vague that it wouldn’t hold up in court. The officer makes the stop anyway, using as a pretext that the driver has violated a minor rule of the road. In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled this practice constitutional. Police officers now routinely make pretextual stops of minority (as well as other) drivers. In the state of Washington, however, pretextual stops were banned in 1999 when the state Supreme Court ruled that such stops violated Washington’s constitution — before changing its mind in a 2012 case, State v. Arreola. This gave the legal scholar Stephen Rushin and the economist Griffin Edwards an opening. They compared stops made by the Washington State Patrol in the period when pretextual stops were disallowed to those made after the Arreola decision. Sure enough, racial disparities rose significantly when troopers were given the legal authority to stop drivers on pretext. Vague suspicions turn out to be a prime outlet for bias. If state legislatures and police departments nationwide were to prohibit pretextual vehicle stops, with the prohibition taken seriously in police training, organizational culture and disciplinary procedures, police officers would be blocked from acting on some of their worst instincts. Banning pretextual stops would free officers to focus their attention on serious traffic safety violations or on stops based on more than a hunch of criminality — a better use of police resources. Since random pretextual stops rarely turn up evidence of serious crime, the effect on crime rates would most likely be minimal, just as the end of “stop and frisk” in New York City did not increase crime there. A second strategy would be to require written consent when an officer asks permission to search a driver’s car. (If the officer has probable cause, no consent is needed.) Starting in 2012, three cities in North Carolina — Fayetteville, and later Durham and Chapel Hill — instituted policies, with varying degrees of commitment, requiring written rather than verbal consent. Three political scientists — Frank Baumgartner, Derek Epp and Kelsey Shoub — examined what happened as a result: The number of cars searched following a traffic stop dropped precipitously. The reason is simple. Written consent forms explain to motorists what their rights are, giving some of them the courage to tell the police no. This changes the incentive structure for police officers looking to stop cars as part of a fishing expedition for contraband. By themselves, written consent forms won’t eliminate racial disparities in traffic stops. The police department in Austin, Texas, for example, has used these forms since 2012 and continues to stop Black drivers disproportionately. But by reducing the frequency of vehicle searches, consent forms make the experience of being stopped less onerous. It’s one thing to be pulled over and ticketed, quite another to have your car rifled through. A third reform has even more potential. Police departments these days are under considerable pressure to track racial disparities in their operations. Yet little is done with this information. Research by the sociologist Emilio Castilla on how to achieve greater gender and racial equity in employee pay shows that if you want to move an organization away from biased practices, transparency and accountability are key. If everyone in a company knows how well each of its different units is faring on diversity and equity metrics, managers will be motivated to make sure that their own unit doesn’t fall behind. Though police unions might resist, police departments could leverage this same principle. On a monthly basis, they could generate statistics showing how officers on particular patrol shifts or in specific precincts are doing at stopping drivers proportional to their demographic representation in the community. Such statistics should be made available for everyone to see on a public-facing dashboard. Sergeants and other supervisors could then be evaluated by how well they manage the behavior of their officers to ensure equity. These three changes — banning pretextual stops, requiring written consent for searches and holding supervisors accountable for the inequitable behavior of their officers — could bring greater justice to our roads. They represent the kind of sensible, research-based policy fixes to policing that are long overdue. Neil Gross is a professor of sociology at Colby College.
