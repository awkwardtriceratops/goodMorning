By Phillip Atiba Goff Dr. Goff is a professor of African-American studies and psychology at Yale University and co-founder and C.E.O. of the Center for Policing Equity.

Since this spring, when Americans watched George Floyd take his last breaths as Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck, we’ve borne witness to the worst that this country’s criminal justice system has to offer: continued extrajudicial killings, failure to hold officers accountable and state-sponsored violence against those standing up for justice. It’s hard to imagine that things could get worse. But draft recommendations from a Trump-appointed policing commission prove that they could. In October 2019, President Trump signed an executive order to establish a commission that Attorney General William P. Barr explained was intended to make the police “trusted and effective guardians of our communities.” From the beginning, its membership — made up entirely of law enforcement — spoke volumes about its intentions. A lawsuit brought by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund argued that the commission makeup violated federal law and this month, a federal judge agreed. He ordered the commission to halt its proceedings, including the release of the report, until it can meet the Federal Advisory Committee Act’s requirement that demands “fairly balanced” viewpoints aired in publicly noticed, open meetings. But the recommendations drafted before this month’s ruling, first reported by Reuters, nonetheless provide a frightening window into the administration’s vision for law enforcement. I say this without exaggeration: The president’s commission was considering recommendations that could transform this nation into a dystopian police state. In May, my colleagues at the Center for Policing Equity and I were asked to give testimony to the commission. We wrote that a more equitable system of policing can be built only when the police are worthy of trust, not fear. We emphasized the need for more transparency and robust data, not less. And we explained why politicizing law enforcement is dangerous: If communities fear that their safety is contingent on their political beliefs, the trust required for public safety is irreparably harmed. To be clear, some live under those conditions now. But a federal push further in that direction would pour lighter fluid on those burning problems. The recommendations could not destroy public trust more efficiently if they were designed solely for that purpose. Reuters reports that they would limit prosecutors’ power to put in place bipartisan, long-needed reforms such as declining to charge low-level drug offenses and eliminating cash bail. Rolling back that progress would be bad enough. Worse still, hamstringing change-minded officials would curtail the power of voters who cast ballots for them. The recommendations would also make the avenues to accountability for law enforcement so narrow that even the most egregious cases of police violence would have a harder time finding their way to just resolutions. Officers accused of wrongdoing would be granted access to body camera footage before speaking to internal investigators, allowing them to shape legally valid explanations for otherwise incriminating actions. Even more ominously, the U.S. Department of Justice would support “qualified immunity,” a legal precedent that protects officers from civil lawsuits. That would turn the federal agency charged with maintaining the rule of law into a personal defense firm for officers accused of violating it.
