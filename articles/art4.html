The United States must win his release before it withdraws from Afghanistan. By Charlene Cakora Mrs. Cakora is the sister of the American hostage Mark Frerichs. LOMBARD, ILL. — When my family and I watched the Republican National Convention last week, we saw six former hostages meeting with President Trump, who boasted of his success at bringing them home. While we are happy for these former hostages, we had hoped that the president would have mentioned my brother, Mark Frerichs. Mark, a Navy veteran, was a commercial contractor in Afghanistan when he was captured on Jan. 31 by the Haqqani network, a wing of the Taliban. On Wednesday, the government offered a reward of up to $5 million for information about Mark and another American hostage in Afghanistan, Paul Edwin Overby. My family and I fully support the president, whom we all voted for in 2016. But we worry that Mark is going to be left behind as President Trump moves forward with a peace accord with the Taliban. Under the tentative accord, signed on Feb. 29, the United States agreed to withdraw all American and allied forces from Afghanistan within 14 months, provided certain conditions are met. News reports suggest that Mr. Trump may want to announce that withdrawal sooner, before his first term ends. The administration is negotiating the final stages of the accord with some of the same people who are responsible for holding Mark — the head of the Haqqani network is the deputy emir of the Taliban. Once any pullout is announced, the Trump administration has little leverage to pressure the Haqqani network to release Mark. As it is, the government lost its best leverage when it signed the deal nearly a month after he was captured. We have asked to meet with the president. We have asked him to call Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the political chief of the Taliban. We have asked if neighboring Pakistan could find out what the Haqqani network wants in exchange for Mark. We have made our case on TV.
