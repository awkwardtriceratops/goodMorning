A suspect was in custody, but information on a motive was not immediately available. By Kwame Opam, Yonette Joseph and Yan Zhuang The police in San Jose, Calif., said they had arrested a suspect in connection with a stabbing attack at a Baptist church on Sunday night in which two people died and three others were wounded. No services were being held at the time of the attack, which was reported at 7:54 p.m. local time, the authorities said. The police said that “unhoused individuals” had been taken to the church to get them out of the cold. The Rev. David Robinson, the pastor of Grace Baptist Church, where the attack took place, said on Monday that the victims and the suspect were among a group of homeless people who had been sheltering there. Each victim had at least one stab wound, the police said. A man was pronounced dead at the scene, they said, and a woman later died at a hospital. Three other victims, all men, were hospitalized in serious condition, the authorities said. The name of the suspect, a man, was not immediately made public on Monday. The church, which is near the campus of San Jose State University, runs a winter shelter program to house homeless people when the temperature drops, and accommodates up to 50 men and women at a time, according to its website. The program usually runs from January to April but was extended this year to help people during the coronavirus pandemic, the website said. “The people who were injured were all part of this community shelter,” Mr. Robinson, the pastor, said in a phone interview. “We know them. It’s painful.” Mr. Robinson said that he worried that the attack would make people more reluctant to use the church’s services, but that his goal was to find a way to reopen. “This kind of violence re-traumatizes people,” he said. “I never thought that this would be part of the deal, but things go sideways and we can’t let that dissuade us. We’ll figure out a way to deal with this. We stand in solidarity with them.” “Our hearts are torn for the victims and their loved ones in last night’s horrific stabbing at Grace Baptist Church on 10th Street,” the San Jose mayor, Sam Liccardo, said in a statement on Monday. “We have lost two community members, and we pray for the recovery of the three others seriously injured in that attack.” San Jose, a city of a little more than one million people, is in Silicon Valley, a major tech hub in the Bay Area. The man and woman who died brought San Jose’s homicide tally for 2020 to 41, the police said, and it was the city’s fourth fatal stabbing episode in four months. Three men were killed in separate attacks in August, September and October. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
