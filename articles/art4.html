By Bill Morlin and Mike Baker MALDEN, Wash. — The wildfire arrived with such ferocity that deputies drove through the streets of Malden, Wash., screaming for people to leave. By the time the blaze passed, not even the fire station was spared — the town’s only fire truck was still trapped inside, turned into an ashen hulk. The devastation in Washington State was repeated up and down the parched West Coast on Wednesday as a wildfire season of unrivaled destruction continued to spread, destroying not only much of Malden but several other communities in the Northwest, while belching enough smoke to blot out the sun in San Francisco. At least six people were killed in the recent blazes. In California, fires have now charred some 2.5 million acres — a modern record and nearly 20 times what had burned at this time last year. In Washington, a wildfire pushed into suburban communities near Tacoma. And in Oregon, officials said hundreds and perhaps more than a thousand homes had already been destroyed. Maps showing the major fires are burning in the western states. Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon called the fires in her state an “unprecedented” situation. She cited several communities that appeared to have been “substantially destroyed”: Blue River, Detroit, Phoenix, Talent, Vida. “We expect to see a great deal of loss, both in structures and in human lives,” Ms. Brown said. “This could be the greatest loss of human lives and property due to wildfire in our state’s history.” Ms. Brown said that teams were fighting 35 wildfires across more than 300,000 acres, and that smaller fires were still erupting. Mass evacuations were continuing, she said, and some people had been rescued from rivers. At least six victims were discovered on Wednesday, and officials feared that they could find more once rescue crews reach some of the areas hardest hit by the fires. In Oregon, Sheriff Joe Kast of Marion County said crews had found two people dead in a vehicle from the Santiam Canyon wildfire east of Salem. Three people were discovered dead because of the Bear Fire in Butte County, Calif., according to Sheriff Kory L. Honea. At the scene of the Cold Springs Fire, in northern Washington, authorities said a 1-year-old boy died and his parents were in critical condition after they attempted to flee their property in Okanogan County. Deputies found the family along the bank of the Columbia River, and the parents were flown to Seattle for treatment. In Malden, which had not confirmed any deaths, Royle Hehr was one of the people who returned to find his home and the surrounding community largely wiped out. Mr. Hehr used to run a flood and fire restoration business in Arizona, becoming witness to the disastrous loss and heartbreak caused by dozens of fires. But all that firsthand experience was not enough to prepare him for the rush of flames that moved into his new community of Malden, an old railroad town in eastern Washington’s Palouse grain country. On Wednesday, he stood outside the ash-filled foundation of what was once his home, wearing cutoffs and a shirt — the only items he escaped with when sheriff’s deputies raced through town on Monday, using loudspeakers to urge everyone to evacuate. “I’ve seen this kind of loss before, dozens of times,” Mr. Hehr, 59, said. “I’ve worked with people who lost everything. I can’t believe this devastation.” The fire consumed not only most homes in Malden, but also City Hall, the post office, the library and the fire station. On Wednesday, volunteers handed out doughnuts and bottled water. Portable toilets and hand-washing stations were set up as wispy tails of smoke from smoldering debris — homes, outbuildings, trees, vegetation and power poles — corkscrewed into the late-summer skies. Four miles down the two-lane county road, three or four large grain bins, filled with recently harvested wheat, continued to burn. One had split open, its commodity ablaze on the ground like sawdust logs. Scott Hokonson, a member of the Town Council and a volunteer firefighter, said the fire had spread “like a bomb went off.” His home was among those destroyed. This wildfire season has been devastating all along the West Coast, fueled by an unusual summer wind event in the Northwest, a record-breaking heat wave followed by wind in California and the early signals of climate change, as warmer average temperatures leave lands parched and vulnerable to a fire started by a spark.
