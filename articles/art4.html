Trump Creates a New Headache for Election Officials<br></h1><p id="artcont">They say he is sowing confusion about systems that already have robust checks against fraud. By Stephanie Saul and Nick Corasaniti By encouraging North Carolina voters to test the integrity of the elections system by casting both mail and in-person ballots, and repeating some of the same claims in a series of tweets on Thursday, President Trump seemed to mimic a cynical slogan originating in 20th Century machine politics: Vote early and often. Indeed, Mr. Trump’s repeated statements suggesting that the nation’s elections system is riddled with fraud fit a historical pattern — politicians in the Jim Crow South, for example, spread the myth of widespread voter fraud to encourage tighter restrictions on voting. His comments have now created a new headache for state election officials, who are already dealing with the formidable task of holding an election during a pandemic. They insist that the type of double voting once suspected of tipping elections in big cities is virtually impossible today, citing robust systems to prevent a person from voting twice. Douglas A. Kellner, co-chairman of the New York State Board of Elections, accused Mr. Trump of fueling concern in the minds of voters and, in doing so, adding more work to county elections boards already “stretched to the limit” by a presidential election and coronavirus. “It’s hard to imagine how we could add any more stress to the system,” said Mr. Kellner, a Democrat. In North Carolina, the election board released a statement on Thursday, saying that “it is illegal to vote twice in an election” and that state law “makes it a Class 1 felony.” Similar laws against intentionally voting more than once exist throughout the country, and it is also prohibited by federal law. Elections officials in North Carolina also hinted that the president himself could have committed a crime, stating that “attempting to vote twice in an election or soliciting someone to do so also is a violation of North Carolina law.” The state’s Democratic attorney general, Josh Stein, said it was outrageous for the president to suggest that people “break the law in order to help him sow chaos in our election.” And Jena Griswold, Colorado’s Democratic secretary of state, said, “2020 has been unprecedented in so many ways, but I never imagined that as secretary of state I would have to inform both the president and the U.S. attorney general that it is illegal to vote twice.” That was after Attorney General William P. Barr suggested during an interview with CNN that he was not sure whether voting twice in North Carolina was illegal. Speaking to reporters in Wilmington, N.C., on Wednesday, Mr. Trump had suggested that people who vote by mail also “then go and vote” in person as well. “They are going to have to check their vote by going to the poll and voting that way because if it tabulates, then they won’t be able to do that,” Mr. Trump said, responding to a reporter’s question on election integrity. “So let them send it in, and let them go vote. And if their system is as good as they say it is, then obviously they won’t be able to vote. If it isn’t tabulated, they will be able to vote.” On Thursday, after Facebook said it would remove video shares of Mr. Trump’s comments, suggesting they had encouraged voter fraud, Mr. Trump seemed to try to walk back those comments in a series of tweets. “Go to your polling place to see whether or not your Mail In Vote has been tabulated (Counted.) If it has you will not be able to Vote & the Mail In System worked properly,” Mr. Trump wrote.
