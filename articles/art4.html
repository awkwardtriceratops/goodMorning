Also: A history-making nomination to the California Supreme Court. By Jill Cowan Good morning. If you haven’t already gotten your ballot, you will soon. And if you live in Los Angeles County, it will ask you to weigh in on one of the most consequential races in the country. No, again, I’m not talking about the presidential race. Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey, elected in 2012 as the first woman and the first African-American to run the nation’s biggest prosecutor’s office, is facing a major challenge from George Gascón, who, until recently, was San Francisco’s district attorney. [Read more from last year about the candidates’ opposing views of criminal justice.] Mr. Gascón, who worked as a police officer in Los Angeles early in his career, pitched himself as a progressive reformer — someone who would help keep people out of jail and prison, rather than continue Ms. Lacey’s tough-on-crime approach. In March, Ms. Lacey narrowly failed to win the majority of primary votes she needed to avoid a runoff. And over the weekend, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles withdrew his endorsement of Ms. Lacey, the incumbent, and became the latest leader to throw his support behind the challenger. “He knows how to promote public safety through partnerships with and beyond law enforcement,” Mr. Garcetti said in a statement. “He will help our county shift the burden from the criminal justice system and jails toward diversion, intervention, and re-entry programs that save money and save lives.” Of course, a lot happened during the months in between. As protests erupted in cities across the country following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, movements for broad criminal justice reform in California picked up speed.
