Though SZA is one of those artists who works at her own pace, plenty of fans have been clamoring over the past few years for a follow-up to her beloved 2017 debut, “Ctrl.” “Hit Different,” her new song with Ty Dolla Sign, suggests that she’s been cooking something up in secret. The Neptunes-produced “Hit Different” is certainly a promising return: Ty anchors the song with a catchy, rhythmic hook, freeing SZA up to unfurl mixed emotions and signature cool throughout the rest of the track: “All that I know is mirrors inside me/They recognize you, please don’t deny me” she croons. The stylish, SZA-directed video, too, is striking: Prepare to never look at a pommel horse the same way again. LINDSAY ZOLADZ
