Colleges Try but Often Fail<br></h1><p id="artcont">Coronavirus outbreaks at colleges reopening for fall classes underscore the difficulties of policing student behavior. By Shawn Hubler and Anemona Hartocollis At Cornell University, students started arriving over the past week hoping for a safe and socially distanced fall semester. Jason Chang already has doubts. A 24-year-old doctoral student, Mr. Chang oversees undergraduates in the dorm where he lives. As the first wave of residents checked in, he caught one student out wandering the halls three times when she was supposed to be quarantining. Another student worker got a phone call from an undergraduate who, from the background noise, appeared to be at an unauthorized party. Another caught two students in supposed isolation hanging out together in a single dorm room. “Constant insanity and madness,” said Mr. Chang, who this fall will share supervision of up to 300 dorm residents with seven other graduate and undergraduate students, all while working on his own Ph.D. in biomedical engineering. “That’s been my life this week.” Struggling to salvage some normalcy — and revenue — from a crippling pandemic, many colleges and universities are inviting students into dorms and classrooms. The limited openings, being tried by more than a third of the country’s 5,000 campuses, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education, have come with strict rules: No parties. Mandated coronavirus tests or routine self-checks for symptoms. No setting foot into public spaces without masks. But early outbreaks at dozens of colleges have underscored the yawning gap between policy and enforcement — and the limitations of any college to control the behavior of young people who are paying for the privilege to attend classes. On-campus restrictions are being undermined by off-campus partying. Student codes of conduct are being signed and promptly forgotten. Day-to-day policing is often falling to teaching assistants and residential advisers who have mixed feelings about confronting scofflaw undergraduates sitting in the front row or living in the next dorm room. Recent videos from several campuses — such as the University of North Georgia — have shown scores or hundreds of students gathering without masks or social distance. On Thursday, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill moved undergraduates to remote instruction when at least 177 students tested positive, largely in clusters linked to dormitories, sororities and fraternities. The University of Notre Dame suspended in-person classes after positive tests by 147 students, most of them seniors living off campus who were infected at gatherings where masks were not worn and social distancing recommendations were not followed. On Tuesday, the school issued a strongly worded statement, urging students to “call one another to accountability.” “University authorities cannot be in all spaces at all times,” the email from student affairs and campus safety officers said. Paul J. Browne, a spokesman for Notre Dame, said the first sign that the outbreak might be contained appeared after classes were temporarily moved online and students living on campus were told not to mix with those living off campus. Students had been surprisingly helpful with contact tracing. “If anything,” he said, “they want the university to be more aggressive.” Indeed, many university officials seem to be relying on students to report one another to enforce coronavirus restrictions. Some colleges are advertising hotlines where students can anonymously report unsafe behavior. (The University of Kentucky’s line is 859-218-SAFE.) A recent TikTok video that has more than 3.4 million views captured the spirit of self-enforcement. In the video, two young men warn that they would rather tell on their classmates than be sent home from their unnamed college. “I will rat you out,” one emphatically warns, adding: “I’m not doing Khan Academy from home. I refuse. And I hate the cops.” A few schools have begun imposing tough penalties to send a message. Purdue University’s president, Mitch Daniels, suspended 36 students in the past week after a cooperative house was caught partying less than 24 hours after he had specifically outlawed off-campus parties. At the University of Connecticut, a mask-free dorm bash got several students evicted from campus housing. At least 14 Drake University students were banned from the Des Moines campus for two weeks for allegedly flouting the school’s no-party edict. “I want to be crystal clear: We are serious and we will not hesitate to take the necessary actions to mitigate the potential spread of Covid-19, jeopardizing the health and safety of others,” the dean of students, Jerry Parker, wrote in a campus email.
