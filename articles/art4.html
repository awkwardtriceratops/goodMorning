By Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns HORN LAKE, Miss. — Mike Espy and Jaime Harrison, two of the five Black Senate candidates in the South this year, may belong to different political generations, but they both came up in a Democratic Party where African-American politicians didn’t talk directly about race in campaigns against white opponents. But there was Mr. Harrison this month, speaking before more than 250 cars at a drive-in rally in South Carolina’s Lowcountry, explicitly urging a mix of white and Black supporters to right the wrongs of the state’s past.“The very first state to secede from the union,” Mr. Harrison said to a cacophony of blaring horns, “because we will be the very first state in this great country of ours that has two African-American senators serving at the very same time — and you will make that happen.” A day later, speaking to an equally diverse audience in northern Mississippi, Mr. Espy called his Republican opponent, Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, “an anachronism.” “She is someone who believes in going back to the old days,” he said, lashing his Republican rival for hailing the Civil War-era South and refusing to take a stand in the debate over Mississippi’s state flag, which until this summer included the Confederate battle emblem. “We need a Mississippi that’s more inclusive, that’s more diverse, more welcoming.” While it has been overshadowed by the presidential race, a political shift is underway in the South that could have a lasting impact well past this election. Democrats have nominated several Black Senate candidates in a region where they’ve often preferred to elevate moderate whites, these contenders are running competitively in conservative states, and they’re doing so by talking explicitly about race. Mr. Harrison, a onetime lobbyist and state party chair; Mr. Espy, the former agriculture secretary; and the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock, the pastor of the storied Ebenezer Baptist Church and a Democratic Senate candidate in Georgia, are each making Republicans nervous about seats that have not been competitive in decades. In Tennessee, where Marquita Bradshaw is competing for an open seat, and Louisiana, where Mayor Adrian Perkins of Shreveport entered late in the race, Black Democratic Senate candidates have also emerged. With two Black Republicans vying for seats, in Michigan and Rhode Island, there are a record seven major-party Black candidates running for the Senate this year. It’s a remarkable roster, particularly in the South, a region that has both the highest concentration of African-American voters and a history of hostility to Black candidates running statewide — a resistance so strong that national Democrats for decades treated Black recruits as an afterthought at best. While Black lawmakers have won House seats in majority-minority districts for decades across the region, they have a harder time capturing contested nominations and then winning white voters statewide. Of the six Black senators elected since Reconstruction, only one has come from the South: Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, a Republican, who was initially appointed to fill a vacancy. In the same period, just one Black governor has been elected in the South. In the most promising Southern races, Democrats have largely supported white candidates, including this year in North Carolina, where the party recruited Cal Cunningham, a moderate former state legislator and military veteran, to challenge Senator Thom Tillis, a vulnerable Republican. “There’s still this Northern perception that this is the South,” said Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who for months has joined Mr. Espy in lobbying Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate minority leader, about the Mississippi race. “And I make the case you have to put in an investment if you want change. You can’t just say, ‘When y’all change we’ll come help you.’ That’s not how you build the party.” Black Southerners say they’ve suffered from a political Catch-22, owing in part to trepidation from risk-averse national Democratic leaders. Until candidates were able to demonstrate that they could prevail, they found it difficult to raise the money necessary to be competitive. Money has scarcely been a problem this year for Mr. Harrison, 44, who broke the record for most cash raised in a quarter. But until recently Mr. Espy, 66, and Mr. Warnock, 51, were not drawing near the fund-raising of Mr. Harrison, illustrating the enduring challenges Black candidates face when they are not running against Republican boogeymen like Senator Lindsey Graham. Should any of them win, though, it would have a catalyzing effect, with more African-American candidates inspired to run beyond the confines of a predominantly Black district and party leaders facing pressure to get behind them instead of trying to clear the field for white candidates who may be perceived as safer bets. “Success breeds success,” said Stacey Abrams, a likely candidate for Georgia governor in 2022 whose competitive race for that office two years ago illustrated both the promise and lingering challenges in the region. Black Democrats are taking notice, said Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes of Wisconsin. “I think more people are going to step up,” said Mr. Barnes, who may run for the Senate in two years, lamenting how many Black politicians had been “relegated to favorable quote-unquote congressional or legislative districts.” More strikingly, the willingness of Black candidates to highlight racial issues and their own history-making potential reflects significant shifts in the region’s politics: the more tolerant racial views of white Southerners, particularly those who are younger, and the expectation among progressive white and Black people alike that politicians will align themselves with social justice at such a tense time. “Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, the flag,” said Mr. Espy, referring to three Black people whose killings this year galvanized nationwide protests. “It’s all around us, so you might as well meet the moment.” Mr. Espy also made clear that, in a state whose white voters are heavily Republican, his political calculus depended on it. He can win only with robust turnout among young Black voters in America’s most heavily Black state per capita, and they are more likely to vote if they know he is an ally. For Mr. Harrison, who’s running in a state with fewer Black people than Mississippi but where white voters are more moderate, the goal is to inspire voters of all races to demonstrate that South Carolina has changed.
