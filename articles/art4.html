The scale of the wildfires is dizzying — millions of acres have burned, 30 different blazes are raging and thousands of people have been displaced. Dry conditions, exacerbated by climate change and combined with a windstorm, created the deadly tinderbox. The disaster has proved a fertile ground for misinformation: Widely discredited rumors spread on social media claiming that antifa activists were setting fires and looting. Today, we hear from people living in the fire’s path. On today’s episode: Jack Healy, a national correspondent for The New York Times. Background reading: “The long-term recovery is going to last years,” an emergency management director said as the fires left a humanitarian disaster in their wake. The fearmongering and false rumors that accompanied a tumultuous summer of protests in Oregon have become a volatile complication in the disaster. Tune in, and tell us what you think.
