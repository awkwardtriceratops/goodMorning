By Shane Goldmacher and Rachel Shorey Long before Joseph R. Biden Jr. was smashing online fund-raising records, long before it was clear he would become the Democratic nominee, his campaign was facing a serious cash crisis. It was late summer 2019 and Mr. Biden’s online fund-raising had slowed to such a trickle that his team basically had to shut down its digital advertising program. They knew the choice was self-defeating: No more online ads meant no more finding new donors. The campaign bottomed out in early September 2019 when Mr. Biden raised just $24,124.17 online in a day. Now? On one recent day, Mr. Biden was raising more than that every two minutes. The unlikely transformation of Mr. Biden, a 77-year-old whose seemingly limited appeal to small donors left him financially outflanked in the primaries, into perhaps the greatest magnet for online money in American political history is a testament to the ferocity of Democratic opposition to President Trump. In a little over a year, the former vice president’s online fund-raising had increased 1,000-fold, to $24.1 million on Sept. 30. Mr. Biden now has a once-unimaginable cash edge over Mr. Trump, and since Sept. 1 he has reserved about $140 million more in television advertising than the president. Money alone does not determine presidential winners — Hillary Clinton vastly outspent Mr. Trump in 2016 — but the cash has provided Mr. Biden enviable flexibility to engineer the electoral map to his advantage. “There was always going to be a large amount of money coming into the nominee,” said Michael Whitney, a Democratic digital fund-raising specialist who worked for Senator Bernie Sanders in the primary. “I’m sure they never dreamed it would be this big.” To chart Mr. Biden’s consequential financial turnabout, The New York Times analyzed the flow of nearly 11 million online contributions from the first nearly 500 days of his campaign. The analysis looked at $436 million given through August to Mr. Biden and his shared committee with the Democratic National Committee via ActBlue, the donation-processing platform. Checks, merchandise sales and other offline giving were not included. The Times analysis shows four inflection points in Mr. Biden’s fund-raising metamorphosis, beginning with one unwittingly provided last fall by Mr. Trump, whose presidency has been rocket fuel for Democratic fund-raising. The other three points — all linked in different ways to race — emerge from the 2020 data: Mr. Biden’s sweeping victories delivered by Black voters in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, the protests following the police killing of George Floyd and, especially, the selection of Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. Ms. Harris, in particular, turbocharged his fund-raising. Mr. Biden’s previous high for online donations in a day had been 102,143 contributions. On Aug. 11, the day he picked Ms. Harris, he received 252,982. The day after, he topped 300,000. Mr. Biden’s committees raised a record-shattering $364.5 million in August, including $205 million online. Then he bested that total in September, officials said. Teddy Goff, a top digital strategist for Mrs. Clinton in 2016 and President Barack Obama in 2012, called those sums “shocking amounts.” “It wasn’t at all clear that a candidate who didn’t spend the last decade building an email fund-raising list, and who isn’t associated with the movement wing of the party, would have such flabbergasting success,” he said. This is how it happened. The first event that reversed Mr. Biden’s financial trajectory came not long after he had scrapped his ad budget: the September 2019 news that Mr. Trump had pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden’s son. That act eventually spurred the president’s impeachment. For many Democratic primary voters, it also was a blunt reminder of Mr. Biden’s polling strength against Mr. Trump. In the 40 days before the call burst into view, on Sept. 20, 2019, Mr. Biden had raised about $62,500 online per day, on average; in the 40 days that followed, he averaged over $159,000. It was something of a financial lifeboat. Over the previous three months, Mr. Biden had been spending more than he raised, depleting his cash reserves. The extra $100,000 a day helped keep the campaign afloat, officials said. Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, said that Mr. Trump’s seeking help from Ukraine “made it clear to the whole world which candidate he feared facing most.” “And we capitalized on that in a way that produced real results,” she said. Mr. Biden’s average daily haul would never again dip below the six-figure mark. Still, Mr. Biden mostly plodded along financially the rest of the pre-primary season. He averaged raising $169,059 per day online last October, $136,518 in November, $128,912 in December and $168,674 in January. In other words, there was no growth. At the same time, donations to his rivals ballooned. By late February, Mr. Biden was teetering politically and had spent only the sixth most of the Democratic field. Then came South Carolina. With Mr. Sanders threatening to seize control of the primary, Black voters gave Mr. Biden a decisive victory — and online money rained down: more than $5 million on Feb. 29 and $5 million the next day. Days later, Mr. Biden swept through Super Tuesday to amass a delegate lead he would never relinquish. Mr. Biden would raise $25.3 million online over seven days — more than he had in the previous four months.
