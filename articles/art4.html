By Remy Tumin and Karen Cetinkaya (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Judge Amy Coney Barrett refused to commit to recusing herself from any legal disputes arising from the Nov. 3 election during her Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Appearing before a deeply divided Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge Barrett insisted that she could be trusted to act as a just arbiter on any matter before the court, and said she would not “allow myself to be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people.” On the topic of the Affordable Care Act, Judge Barrett, who has criticized a past Supreme Court decision that declined to strike down a key part of the health care law, said she was “not here on a mission to destroy” the legislation. Frustrated Democrats dismissed her assurances. She invoked her predecessors and refused to say how she would rule in potential cases on abortion, the election and same-sex marriage. Quoting Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, she said, “No hints, no forecasts, no previews.” Questioning is expected to go late into the night. Follow live updates here. Also out of Washington: The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to shut down the census count early, a move that could allow the Census Bureau to submit tabulations excluding unauthorized immigrants by the end of the year. 2. There are two new setbacks in the fight against the coronavirus. Eli Lilly paused a clinical trial into an antibody treatment because of a “potential safety concern,” a day after Johnson & Johnson announced the pause of its coronavirus vaccine trial because of a sick clinical trial participant. Such pauses are not unusual, and illness in volunteers is not necessarily a result of the experimental drug or vaccine being assessed. As the trials edge forward, about 450,000 Americans have been hospitalized with Covid-19. Even for those covered by robust health insurance, hospitalization can generate costs. We spoke to virus patients who are battling surprise medical bills after a congressional effort to ban them failed before the pandemic. One staggering price: a $52,000 helicopter transport. 3. South Carolina is changing. Is it enough to put Jaime Harrison over the top? Mr. Harrison, the unexpectedly competitive Democratic challenger in the U.S. Senate race against Senator Lindsey Graham, is betting that immigration and growing support from women will push him over the top. The state hasn’t had a Democratic senator in decades. But Mr. Harrison has something previous South Carolina Democrats did not: a record-setting fund-raising haul.
