By Michael M. Grynbaum President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. will debate with a single moderator at each of their three matchups, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced on Wednesday. The first debate of the general election, on Sept. 29, will be moderated by the “Fox News Sunday” anchor Chris Wallace. Mr. Wallace received high marks for his debut debate in 2016 and is known for his sharp interviewing style. He is also frequently a target of needling tweets by Mr. Trump. The second debate, on Oct. 15, will be moderated by Steve Scully, the political editor at C-SPAN and a figure well-known in the Washington media community. Mr. Scully has served as an alternate moderator in past years but has never taken charge of a debate. Kristen Welker, a White House correspondent for NBC News and a co-anchor of the weekend “Today” program, will moderate the third debate on Oct. 22. This will be her first time moderating a general-election debate. The debate commission turned to a print journalist, Susan Page, the Washington bureau chief of USA Today, to moderate the vice-presidential debate between Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris on Oct. 7.
