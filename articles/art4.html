The Moderator’<br></h1><p id="artcont">Readers share their thoughts on the final presidential debate. By Rachel L. Harris and Lisa Tarchak Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants. Did Thursday’s debate — the final for this election — change anyone’s mind about who should lead the country? Opinion’s political writers have shared their thoughts and we’ve asked readers to do the same. On the whole, they found the evening’s proceedings far more palatable than the first matchup between President Trump and Joe Biden: “This debate was almost watchable,” wrote Emily Smith, a reader in Seattle. “Who won? The moderator.” But there was disagreement as to who was the more persuasive orator. “Trump’s attack on Biden’s statement about oil and gas was the first effective outreach to traditional conservatives that I have seen during the election,” wrote Robby O’Neil in Austin, Texas. On the other hand, Simeon Atha in Columbus, Ohio, found Biden’s promise to wind down the oil industry inspiring. “As a young person, it’s really encouraging to hear that there’s hope I’ll have a healthy planet to live on,” he wrote.
