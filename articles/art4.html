By Alex Marshall LONDON — Debut novelists dominated the shortlist for this year’s Booker Prize, one of the world’s most prestigious literary awards, the judges announced on Tuesday, while star authors like Hilary Mantel and Anne Tyler did not make the list. Four of the six shortlisted books are from first-time writers, three of whom are American, while the fourth holds dual Scottish and American nationality. Four of the shortlisted books are by women. The nominated debuts include Douglas Stuart’s “Shuggie Bain,” a violent tale of a child growing up in 1980s Scotland; and Brandon Taylor’s “Real Life,” about a Black gay graduate student navigating campus life. Diane Cook’s “The New Wilderness,” set in a dystopian future in which almost all of the natural world has been destroyed; and Avni Doshi’s “Burnt Sugar,” about an artist’s struggles to cope with her aging mother, are the other two debuts on the list. The number of debuts “was a surprise” said Sameer Rahim, an author and one of the judges, in a news conference in London announcing the shortlist. But he said it was “a red herring” to focus on that issue, because lots of the authors had previous writing experience. The judges also read the majority of the submitted books on PDFs, few of which contained biographical information, Rahim added, so they didn’t know which were by debut novelists. “You don’t have time to Google the authors,” he said. In previous years, the Booker shortlist has been dominated by literary heavyweights, with works by Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie and Elif Shafak all appearing on last year’s list. In 2018, a group of high profile authors demanded — unsuccessfully — that the Man Booker Foundation bar American authors from being eligible for the prize. The longlist for this year’s prize, revealed in July, had included Hilary Mantel’s “The Mirror and the Light,” the conclusion to her acclaimed trilogy about Thomas Cromwell; and Anne Tyler’s “Redhead by the Side of the Road.” But neither book made the cut. “As good as it was, there were six that were better,” said the author Lee Child, one of the judges, when asked about Mantel’s omission in the news conference.
