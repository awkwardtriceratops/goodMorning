By Ana Swanson, David McCabe and Lauren Hirsch WASHINGTON — Even as negotiations continued on Wednesday over a proposal that would allow the Chinese-owned social media app TikTok to continue operating in the United States, a backlash was forming in Washington to the deal. Over the weekend, TikTok had offered a proposal to the Treasury Department that aimed to address the Trump administration’s concerns that the app could give the Chinese government access to sensitive data. The proposal included bringing on Oracle, the Silicon Valley business software company, as a technology partner to TikTok. But Oracle would not own TikTok outright and the app would not transfer ownership of its valuable recommendation algorithm to Oracle. That proposal is now under review by a secretive, multi-agency national security panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is expected to submit its recommendation to President Trump for a final decision on Thursday. But while the proposal winds its way through the review process, some lawmakers are increasingly up in arms about it. In a letter on Wednesday, Republican senators including Marco Rubio of Florida, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and John Cornyn of Texas criticized the proposal, saying that any deal that left a Chinese company — in this case, TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance — in control of the code or algorithms that run the app would fail to address national security concerns. In their letter, the Senate Republicans said the prospective arrangement with Oracle raised “significant concerns,” arguing that a partial sale or “trusted partnership deal” would be “insufficient in achieving the goals of protecting Americans and U.S. interests.” The letter was just the latest sign of discontent about the Oracle-related proposal for TikTok. On Monday, Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, a Republican, said in a separate letter that the Trump administration should reject the proposal. He said that “perhaps, given constraints imposed by Chinese law, the only feasible way to maintain Americans’ security is to effectively ban the TikTok app in the United States altogether.” The congressional objections raise the question of whether Mr. Trump could face criticism for the Oracle-TikTok proposal on the campaign trail. Mr. Trump, who had made positive comments about a deal on Tuesday, appeared to be aware of the growing debate. “I’m not prepared to sign off on anything. I have to see the deal,” he said at a news conference on Wednesday. “They’re going to be reporting to me tomorrow morning.” He added that he was “not going to be happy” if TikTok remained largely owned by a Chinese company. A day earlier, when asked about his thinking on an Oracle partnership with TikTok, Mr. Trump had said he would be making a decision “soon.” He added that he had “high respect” for Larry Ellison, Oracle’s founder. “He’s somebody I know,” Mr. Trump said. “He’s been, really, a terrific guy for a long time. So we’re going to take a look.” The backlash from lawmakers adds another twist to the drama over TikTok, which is hugely popular among teenagers and influencers and has seeped into popular culture. The app has been under scrutiny by the Trump administration for national security concerns for months, with critics saying it could provide a conduit for the Chinese government to gather data on American citizens. Chinese law requires that Chinese citizens share data with their government if asked.
