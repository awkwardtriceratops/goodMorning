By Lisa Lerer For much of the summer, President Trump argued that Joseph R. Biden Jr. was scared to debate him, reliant on performance-enhancing drugs and barely able to remain upright for 90 minutes because of his purportedly failing health. That was then. Now, Mr. Trump is receiving medication to treat a case of a virus he has failed to control, and he has become the candidate casting doubt on his participation in the next debate. After the Commission on Presidential Debates announced plans to hold next week’s town hall virtually, Mr. Trump threatened to skip the event entirely, plunging the two campaigns into a daylong debate over debates. The president’s central concern: the possibility of a mute button. “I’m not going to waste my time on a virtual debate,” he told Fox News. “You sit behind a computer and do a debate — it’s ridiculous, and then they cut you off whenever they want.” The White House’s approach to avoiding accountability for its record is becoming clearer than ever: to distract, interrupt and even blow up debates that might focus attention on Mr. Trump’s handling of the virus and other issues. The strategy was on vivid display Wednesday night, when Vice President Mike Pence repeatedly interrupted Senator Kamala Harris and talked over the moderator, Susan Page, ignoring rules about speaking time. While Mr. Pence’s behavior paled in comparison to the barrage of hectoring from Mr. Trump during the first presidential debate, it was a notable deviation from the norm. Mr. Pence, a soft-spoken former governor, frequently takes on the role of the polite neighbor minding his own business amid the leaf-blowing din of the Trump administration. The president’s threatened refusal to debate virtually is in keeping with the disorder that Mr. Pence generally sidesteps. But it may be little more than a negotiating tactic. Mr. Biden has said he plans to take questions from voters next week — with or without Mr. Trump present. For the president to forgo the opportunity to make his case before one of the biggest audiences of the campaign would be strikingly out of character for the former reality television host. “If you think Trump is going to refuse an audience of 80 million people, I got a gold tower on Fifth Avenue to sell you,” said Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist. “This is a negotiating mechanism.” The president has been known to engage in projection, accusing his political opponents of the same charges they make against him. The debate may be no different. After the first debate, Mr. Trump accused Mr. Biden of not wanting to face off against him for a second time. “I hear he doesn’t want to go forward,” he told reporters, hours after Mr. Biden had said in an appearance that he was looking forward to the next debate. “That’s up to him. I don’t mind debating him.” Yet, at a time when American life is defined by the singular political force of the pandemic, the president is grasping for opportunities to change the topic. Months of effort by Mr. Trump to dismiss the disease or shift attention to other issues, like racial justice protests or the Supreme Court, have largely failed. Now, with Mr. Trump infected and the virus ravaging his White House, his last option may be simply not to let anyone else get a word in. “You could list a thousand things in the world that they would rather talk about than coronavirus and how they’ve dealt with it,” said Robert Gibbs, a Democratic strategist who helped prepare former President Barack Obama for debates. “It goes back to this idea that if you can’t control the narrative, then flood the zone and muddy the waters.” On Wednesday, Mr. Pence’s attempt to control the narrative was evident primarily in the questions he sidestepped and the time limits he ignored. Four years ago, Senator Tim Kaine came across more as the aggressor, often interrupting a more restrained Mr. Pence in their vice-presidential debate. Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist who helped prepare Mr. Kaine, said her team had expected Mr. Pence to stick with his talking points with a respectful smile — a tactic he largely adopted. Wednesday night, he took a far more assertive approach. According to a CBS News tally of the debate, Mr. Pence interrupted Ms. Harris twice as often as the reverse, though the two got nearly the same amount of speaking time.
