By Azi Paybarah and Christina Morales Three police officers were in stable condition after being shot as they responded to a call at a home in Cedar Park, Texas, north of Austin, the police said. A person remained barricaded inside the house after the gunfire, the Cedar Park Police said on Twitter. Police, fire and medical emergency vehicles lined the street, according to live video from the scene broadcast on Facebook by local reporters. “Just left the hospital and all 3 ofc’s are in stable condition,” Mike Harmon, interim chief of Cedar Park said on Twitter Sunday evening. “Thank you to everyone who has expressed their concern.” We are on scene of a shooting where multiple Cedar Park Police Officers have been shot while responding to a call at a home off Natalie Cove.

Neighbors described a burst of gunfire erupting on a quiet afternoon in the residential community near Heritage Park. About seven houses away from where the shooting took place, Andrew Thompson, 30, said he went to his front yard when he heard sirens approaching a nearby cul-de-sac and saw at least three police cars. “They were getting really close, and I went outside to see what was going on,” Mr. Thompson said. About five minutes after going outside, Mr. Thompson said, he heard about 20 rounds of gunfire. He said he saw officers running down the road asking other officers for help and noticed several were injured. He said a female officer rendered aid and that he saw two male officers bleeding, one from the head, and one from the arm. Norma Howell, 44, said she saw two male officers enter ambulances, one walking with help, and another who was carried into an ambulance. Another neighbor recalled seeing police vehicles rushing to the scene before hearing several rounds of gunshots. “You don’t think gunshots around here,” Christine Muat, who lives a block from the scene of the shooting, said in an  interview. Ms. Muat said she was in her home when she and her husband noticed police vehicles speeding down the street. Soon they heard “four or five very faint muffled shots,” she said. Ms. Muat and her husband looked at each other “and then we heard probably three more,” she said. As Ms. Muat and her neighbors huddled to make sense of what was happening, more gunfire erupted.
