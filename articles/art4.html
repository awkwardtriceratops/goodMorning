By Dan Bilefsky MONTREAL — The police in Quebec City said on Sunday that they had arrested a man dressed in medieval garb and brandishing a sword after a series of stabbings on Halloween night left at least two people dead and five others wounded. The attacks occurred late Saturday in a historic district of Quebec City near the building that houses the provincial Parliament. “It has all the ingredients of a horror film, a man disguised who goes out on Halloween and kills people,” said Hadi Hassin, a local journalist who lives in the area. “I go out every night in the district and will be spooked for a while.” The police chief of Quebec City, Robert Pigeon, said the suspect was not known to be associated with any terrorist organization, and the mayor suggested that mental illness might have been a factor. Chief Pigeon said that the suspect was 24 and that the attack appeared to have been premeditated and motivated by personal reasons. He said the suspect came from the suburbs north of Montreal, adding that medical records showed that five years ago he had threatened an act of violence. Chief Pigeon said the attacker had used a Japanese-style sword and had lunged at his victims, appearing to choose them randomly. He said the attacker had acted “with the intention of doing the most damage possible” and noted that officers were investigating 25 crime scenes. The suspect was expected to appear in court on Sunday via video conference, he added. The police identified the two people killed as François Duchesne, 56, and Suzanne Clermont, 61. Le Soleil, a Quebec City newspaper, said Ms. Clermont was a jovial hairdresser who enjoyed cooking for her neighbors. The chief said that some of the five wounded people, who were all residents of Quebec City, had been severely cut but that their injuries did not appear to be life-threatening. “All the citizens of our city are in mourning,” he added.
