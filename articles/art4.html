By Kathleen Gray WEST BLOOMFIELD, Mich. — When Gov. Gretchen Whitmer joined Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign in early March as a national co-chair, she was prepared to help him in the rigorous search for a running mate. Then, after gaining national recognition for her deft leadership in her state of Michigan during the coronavirus crisis, as well as her frequent criticism of the president’s pandemic response, she got a call from Mr. Biden and underwent the rigors of being vetted herself. Her turn in the spotlight would flash and fade over the next four months, as she faced attacks for her coronavirus policies from President Trump, right-wing protesters and Michigan Republican lawmakers. But early this month, Ms. Whitmer shot to the top tier of candidates once again as word leaked that she had flown to Delaware to meet personally with the Bidens. While Mr. Biden eventually chose Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, Ms. Whitmer will still play an outsize role in the campaign as the Democratic leader of a key battleground state crucial to Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016. With a margin of 10,704 votes over Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate since 1988 to win Michigan.
