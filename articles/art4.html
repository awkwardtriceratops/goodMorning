As part of the agreement, the league committed to a new series of social justice efforts. By Sopan Deb The N.B.A. announced a plan to convert some of its arenas into polling locations for the November election as part of an agreement with its players’ union to resume the playoffs on Saturday, union and league officials said in a joint statement Friday. “We had a candid, impassioned and productive conversation yesterday between N.B.A. players, coaches and team governors regarding next steps to further our collective efforts and actions in support of social justice and racial equality,” said the statement signed by N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver and Michele Roberts, the executive director of the players’ union. The announcement came two days after N.B.A. players staged a dramatic work stoppage in response to the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis., on Sunday. Oklahoma City Thunder guard Chris Paul, the players’ union president, told reporters Friday that he had never experienced anything like this in his 15 years in the league. “We’re all tired of seeing the same thing over and over again, and everybody just expects us to be OK just because we get paid great money,” Paul said. “You know, we’re human. We have real feelings. And I’m glad that we got the chance to get in a room together to talk with one another.” The Milwaukee Bucks will face the Orlando Magic at 3:30 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday for the first game back. It was this matchup — the fifth game of their first-round playoff series — that the Bucks walked out of, spurring a wave of work stoppages across sports leagues, including the W.N.B.A., Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer. W.N.B.A. teams also did not play on Thursday. Nneka Ogwumike, the W.N.B.A. players union president, said in a statement that the action was not a strike or a boycott, but instead a “day of reflection.” Ogwumike said the players’ union was calling for the arrests of the police officers who shot Blake and who killed Breonna Taylor, a Black woman in Kentucky. Ogwumike’s statement concluded with: “DO SOMETHING. TODAY.” The W.N.B.A. resumed playing on Friday. At least 100 staffers who work for the N.B.A. league office also chose not to work Friday to instead focus on social causes. “I am virtually walking out of the office in opposition to systemic racism and police brutality in this country in solidarity with our N.B.A. and W.N.B.A. players,” an automatic email response from one of those employees said. “I will not be responding to any work emails. Instead, I will be taking the day to contact state and local officials to demand justice for Jacob Blake and for the police officers involved to be held accountable.” The N.B.A. and its union’s plan also includes, according to the announcement, the creation of “a social justice coalition, with representatives from players, coaches and governors, that will be focused on a broad range of issues, including increasing access to voting, promoting civic engagement, and advocating for meaningful police and criminal justice reform.”
