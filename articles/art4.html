By Annalee Newitz Contributing Opinion Writer During the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States, Americans were bombarded with contradictory information. Don’t wear masks!

Confused, afraid and desperate to survive, we turned to one of our favorite pastimes: public shaming. Angry people posted pictures on social media of maskless crowds frolicking in parks without any social distancing. Politicians responded quickly, blaming the spread of the virus on summer holiday revelers, and local authorities shut down beaches across the nation. The message was clear. If you don’t obey the ever-changing guidelines, your neighbors will shame you on Instagram, and your government will punish you with park closings, fines, or worse.
