By Richard Fausset DALTON, Ga. — On a recent Sunday morning in northwest Georgia, the Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, the South’s most prominent Black preacher and a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, was giving his stump speech, mixing a little laid-back pulpit humor with a searing, Jeremiah-like condemnation of Republicans in the age of Trump. He castigated them for neglecting “the poorest of the poor” while providing for “the richest of the rich.” He accused them of distracting the country with bigotry and division. He took care to poke fun at himself when he got carried away by emotion. (“Y’all be careful,” he said. “It’s Sunday.”) And he called, as he so often has, for the expansion of the Affordable Care Act. “I’ve read the Gospels a few times, and Jesus spent a lot of time healing the sick,” he said. “Even those with pre-existing conditions.” Polls show Dr. Warnock, 51, leading a crowded field in one of two Senate races in Georgia, running with the same playbook used by his close ally Stacey Abrams, who came tantalizingly close to an upset in the 2018 governor’s race by turning out minorities and younger voters in this demographically changing state. Dr. Warnock brings something else to the table. His position as the senior pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta gives him a direct connection to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who preached at the church, and, by extension, a central place in the nation’s ongoing civil rights conversation. But the Dr. King that animates Dr. Warnock’s campaign is not the anodyne figure sometimes portrayed in popular myth. Dr. Warnock considers himself a disciple of the flesh-and-blood Dr. King, who was not only an avatar of nonviolence, but also a rabble-rousing champion of the poor. And while Georgia, a state not too long removed from its Jim Crow past, may be ready to send a Black senator to Washington, is it willing to elect someone as unabashedly progressive as Dr. Warnock, even if he comes to politics as a man of God? So far, Dr. Warnock has benefited from the peculiar nature of his race, an open, multiparty contest that includes two Republicans who are currently splitting the conservative vote, Representative Doug Collins and Senator Kelly Loeffler. Matt Lieberman, a Democrat and the son of former Connecticut Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, has declined to drop out, despite pleas from numerous party leaders. All of this presents the possibility that no candidate will get a majority of the votes. That would trigger a January runoff, in which Dr. Warnock could face off against a single Republican, who would most likely consolidate conservative support. For now, though, Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Collins have been so busy attacking each other, and fighting to prove they are the more conservative candidate, that they have had little time to savage Dr. Warnock. That has left him free to define himself, emphasizing his up-from-poverty life story in  ads. In one early spot, he walks through the Savannah, Ga., housing project where he grew up with 11 brothers and sisters, and declares that children there today “have it harder now than I did back then. That’s got to change.” The ad also underscores his role at Ebenezer, part of his campaign’s full-on embrace of his life in the church — he calls his recent barnstorming campaign the “Rev Up the Vote” tour — and the leap he is trying to make from the pulpit to the Senate. “There is alway a distance between the ideals that we set and the reality of our lives,” he said in a brief interview after a campaign stop in Rome, Ga. “I think that’s the case of the church, and the covenant we have there, and that’s the case with respect to the American covenant.” Dr. Warnock found his religious calling early in life. Both of his parents were Pentecostal preachers — his father also worked salvaging abandoned cars — and his future vocation seemed so obvious in high school that his friends called him “Rev.” From there, he built a résumé that made his ascendance at Ebenezer seem preordained. He attended Morehouse College (Dr. King’s alma mater), then the Union Theological Seminary in New York City. There he earned advanced degrees and found a mentor in the Rev. Dr. James H. Cone, father of Black liberation theology, a system Dr. Cone once described as “an interpretation of the Christian Gospel from the experience and perspectives and lives of people who are at the bottom in society — the lowest economic and racial groups.” In the 1990s Dr. Warnock worked as an assistant pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church, a spiritual pillar of Harlem, where he spoke out against the work requirements that were central to then-mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani’s welfare reform efforts. Dr. Warnock called the program a “hoax” that used welfare recipients “to displace other workers who receive respectable compensation.” He also took a stand against the emerging genre of gangster rap (“I’ve had to endure that ugly ‘N-word’ for some 400 years now, and enough is enough!” he said), although later, in Atlanta, he would team up on social justice initiatives with rappers like T.I. and 2 Chainz. He continued his social reform work as senior pastor at Douglas Memorial Community Church in Baltimore, where he urged his flock to take H.I.V. tests in an effort to stem an AIDS crisis among African-Americans. In 2005, he moved to Atlanta, becoming only the fifth senior pastor in the storied history of Ebenezer Baptist. It is a job like no other. Ebenezer is a working Black church, with pews filled on Sundays with everyday people engaged in worship and fellowship, showing off the wares of the city’s best tailors and haberdashers. But it is also part of a loose complex of King-related tourist destinations, some run by the National Park Service, in Atlanta’s historic Old Fourth Ward, and it regularly hosts some of the nation’s best-known politicians, both Republican and Democrat, who come to honor and bask in the King legacy. When Dr. Warnock first arrived at Ebenezer, that legacy had rivals. In Atlanta, as elsewhere in the United States, the religious movement known as the “prosperity gospel” was on the rise, with African-American preachers like Bishop Eddie L. Long and Rev. Creflo A. Dollar Jr. telling followers that their faith would deliver them material riches. Dr. Warnock was a critic from the beginning. “King didn’t preach to garbage collectors” that “they should ‘name it and claim it,’” he said in a 2005 interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “He spoke to the social structure that was oppressing the garbage collectors. And for that, he gave his life. To me, that’s what Christian ministry is all about.” Like Dr. King, he sometimes landed in jail. In 2014, he was arrested at the state capitol while protesting Republicans’ refusal to expand Medicaid under Obamacare. In 2017, he was arrested in Washington for protesting proposed budget cuts to social services. He supports abortion rights and gay marriage, and he has publicly defended the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., who was once the pastor of former President Barack Obama. Mr. Wright’s sermon outlining the nation’s past oppression of minorities included the phrase “God damn America,” creating problems in 2008 for Mr. Obama during his first presidential campaign. (Dr. Warnock has suggested the sermon squared with the “truth-telling tradition of the Black church.”) Dr. Warnock has already come in for criticism from conservative media for comments critical of the police. “We shouldn’t be surprised when we see police officers act like bullies on the street,” he said, in one of a series of clips highlighted by the Fox News host Tucker Carlson. All of these positions place him firmly on the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, something Republicans are already planning to focus on should he make it to the runoff. “Raphael Warnock has defended radical Jeremiah Wright while trashing police officers,” Stewart Bragg, executive director of the Georgia Republican Party, said on Thursday. Republicans have signaled that they plan to make an issue of his private life, too. Before finalizing his divorce this year, Dr. Warnock was accused by his now ex-wife of running over her foot with his car during an argument, an allegation he has denied. The incident with Dr. Warnock’s ex-wife, Mr. Bragg said, “is merely the tip of the iceberg of what voters will find out” about him. Still, Dr. Warnock believes he can make converts of some white evangelical voters, given their common faith. He had originally envisioned going to Bible studies on Wednesday nights “with people who don’t share my politics, but we read the same book.” Those plans were stymied by the coronavirus pandemic, but Mr. Warnock remains optimistic. “I would hope they would give me a hearing,” he said. He is also banking on the idea that people of all races will be receptive to his position that Georgia should expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Georgia is one of a handful of states that have declined to fully expand Medicaid coverage. A partial expansion will roll out in 2021, but advocates for a full expansion, which is opposed by many Republicans, say it would bring coverage to hundreds of thousands of low-income people, and help revive the state’s ailing rural health care system. The mask-wearing crowd that came to hear Dr. Warnock’s Oct. 25 speech outside of a Dalton recreation center numbered about 200, mostly Black but not exclusively so. The pastor’s mix of policy, bonhomie and righteous anger left them electrified. In church terms, they were moved by the spirit. But not everyone can be so easily moved. As Mr. Warnock’s big campaign bus drove out of town, it roared by a few dozen white anti-abortion protesters strung out along a sidewalk near a Chick-fil-A restaurant. Daniel Hocker, 42, a budget analyst for a real-estate investment company, held up a sign calling for the defunding of Planned Parenthood. He said he could never vote for a candidate who did not oppose abortion. “I have to vote my conscience,” he said. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
