Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Wednesday. Weather: Dense fog and drizzle early, then gradually clearing clouds. High in the low to mid-70s. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Nov. 1 (All Saints Day). New Yorkers first began to receive census questionnaires in March. Then the pandemic hit. As wealthy residents fled the city for second homes, census officials like Julie Menin, the director of NYC Census 2020, began to worry. Widespread noncompliance could mean New York’s losing out on millions of dollars in federal aid to low-income residents, and even congressional seats. But on Tuesday, the results were in: New York City announced a self-response rate of nearly 62 percent. (Self-response means people respond on their own, either through the mail, telephone or via internet; people who respond to census takers who canvass neighborhoods aren’t included in this number.) The self-response number was “essentially identical as the rate in 2010, but with so many more challenges in the way,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference on Tuesday. Here are four takeaways from the census announcement: The Census Bureau initially expected a self-response rate of 58 percent in New York City. The virus then made prospects bleaker. Instead, the city exceeded predictions and outperformed a number of other major cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami. In particular, Brooklyn, Staten Island and Queens made significant gains compared with the self-response rates in 2010, Ms. Menin said. The Bronx made marginal gains this year, but Manhattan’s rate went down by nearly 5 percentage points. As my colleague Dana Rubinstein reported over the summer, many affluent residents fled Manhattan at the height of the pandemic. That meant questionnaires were going unanswered in neighborhoods like Murray Hill, TriBeCa and the Upper East Side, Ms. Menin said. Across the city, the pandemic also put a halt on plans to open over 300 census centers to reach New Yorkers who lack broadband internet; the questionnaire, while mailed to households, can also be completed online. NYC Census 2020, an initiative of the city government, soon launched a $40 million outreach campaign. It sent seven million texts and made four million calls to residents, urging them to take part in the count. Most recently, the efforts were cut short when the Trump administration ended the census count two weeks early. The census affects the nationwide distribution of more than $1.5 trillion in federal aid, money that is crucial for schools, public housing, health care and other programs at a time when New York City is strapped for cash. The count is taken every 10 years. Ms. Menin said that a single New Yorker who isn’t counted is equivalent to a loss of $2,700 per year in federal funding. If the city is undercounted by just 1 percentage point, schools could lose nearly $7.3 million — the equivalent of all the textbooks that 29,000 students would need in a school year, according to a congressional report. There could be electoral repercussions, too. An undercount coupled with New York’s declining population could possibly cost the state two congressional seats. Is a Second Wave Starting?
