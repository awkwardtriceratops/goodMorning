By Laura Rosenberger Ms. Rosenberger is the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy. Americans have heard a lot about threats to the 2020 election. But one of the greatest threats may be a loss of faith in our electoral system itself. The director of the F.B.I., Christopher Wray, told Congress in September that his greatest concern about the election was the erosion of voter confidence — and “a perception of futility” fueled in part by disinformation and cyberattacks. That’s because the overarching goal of our adversaries is not to elect any one candidate, but to cast doubt on the integrity of our institutions. Americans must play a powerful role ensuring they don’t succeed. Be prepared for the days ahead with credible information, realistic expectations — and a lot of patience. Here are some ways to defend our democracy: 1. Don’t overstate the risks. The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA, has not identified any cyber incidents thus far that are capable of preventing Americans from voting. Federal, state and local officials have taken significant steps to secure election systems. Federal agencies charged with leading the effort to protect the election have released statements and a video on potential threats, and on the response, along with tangible steps voters can take. It’s important to note that about 92 percent of votes cast this election will have a paper record (up from roughly 80 percent four years ago). These paper records will enable postelection audits, helping confirm that votes are tallied accurately. More can and should be done, but some experts have argued that 2020 could be the most secure election the United States has ever known. 2. Know what’s real and not. President Trump has spread baseless claims of mail-in ballot fraud, and his attempts to sow confusion and doubt leave many voters unsure of what information is credible. Federal officials have warned that foreign rivals could spread disinformation about the election results or supposedly compromised voting systems, hoping to cast doubt on the outcome.
