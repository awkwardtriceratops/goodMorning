By Brooks Barnes and Nicole Sperling LOS ANGELES — For four decades, even as other moguls came and went, Ron Meyer remained a Hollywood power player of the first order, a combination of amiable mayor and string-pulling godfather. But his career came to an apparent end on Tuesday in a way that has become numbingly routine in the entertainment business: He was ensnared in a tawdry scandal. Mr. Meyer, 75, stepped down from NBCUniversal, where he was lately the executive vice chairman, claiming he was the victim of an attempt to “extort” him that was related to a past extramarital affair. “I recently disclosed to my family and the company that I made a settlement, under threat, with a woman outside the company who had made false accusations against me,” Mr. Meyer said in a statement. He did not identify the woman. According to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private details, she is Charlotte Kirk, 28, a British actress. She was in the news last year, when her involvement with another Hollywood executive, Kevin Tsujihara, became public and led to his resignation from his job as the chairman of Warner Bros. Ms. Kirk had a sexual relationship with Mr. Tsujihara in 2013, around the time she was involved with Mr. Meyer. Ms. Kirk did not respond to a request for comment. Her manager, Shannon Pierce, asked whether payment in return for an interview with Ms. Kirk was possible. The New York Times does not pay for interviews. In his statement, Mr. Meyer added: “Admittedly, this is a woman I had a very brief and consensual affair with many years ago. I made this disclosure because other parties learned of the settlement and have continuously attempted to extort me into paying them money or else they intended to falsely implicate NBCUniversal, which had nothing to do with this matter, and to publish false allegations about me.” After the settlement, a male acquaintance of Ms. Kirk’s had made the repeated requests for more money from Mr. Meyer, according to the people briefed on the matter. A police report does not appear to have been filed. Mr. Meyer led the Universal film studio from 1995 to 2013, when he was replaced by Jeff Shell, who was named the chief executive officer of NBCUniversal in January. Since 2013, Mr. Meyer had served the company as a kind of statesman. He had no daily role in the studio’s movie operation and oversaw the company’s unglamorous theme park business. But he maintained substantial influence in Hollywood, where he has deeper relationships than almost any other executive and people reverentially refer to him as Ronnie. Mr. Shell informed NBCUniversal employees of what he called the “unfortunate news” in an email on Tuesday. “Late last week Ron Meyer informed NBCUniversal that he had acted in a manner which we believe is not consistent with our company policies or values,” Mr. Shell wrote. “Based on Ron’s disclosure of these actions, we have mutually concluded that Ron should leave the company, effective immediately. We thank Ron for his 25 years of service, and for his significant contributions to NBCUniversal.” NBCUniversal decided to part ways with Mr. Meyer because he had settled with Ms. Kirk without informing anyone at the company, potentially exposing it to liability, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The settlement with Ms. Kirk took place a few years ago, long after their sexual relationship ended, these people said. Last year, Mr. Tsujihara, the Warner Bros. executive who was involved with Ms. Kirk, stepped down from his job after The Hollywood Reporter revealed accusations that, at her request, he had pushed for her to be considered for film and television roles. Ms. Kirk’s credits include bit parts in two Warner films: “Ocean’s 8,” which was released in 2018, and “How to Be Single,” released in 2016. Mr. Tsujihara has denied having anything to do with her casting. It is unknown whether Ms. Kirk sought casting help from Mr. Meyer. Nothing on her résumé was made by NBCUniversal.
