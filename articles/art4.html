In an interview, Michaels, the show’s creator, talks about pandemic preparations and why “a little danger” can be good for comedy. By Dave Itzkoff Lorne Michaels doesn’t usually spend six months away from his office, but this year he had no choice. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, he and his colleagues at “Saturday Night Live” had to leave behind the show’s home at Studio 8H in NBC’s Rockefeller Plaza headquarters in March, and its live broadcasts came to an abrupt halt. Though “S.N.L.” was able to close out its previous season with three remotely produced episodes, the show only recently announced that its live episodes would resume when its new season begins on Oct. 3. Michaels, the creator and longtime executive producer of “S.N.L.”, went back to work shortly after Labor Day and has been making preparations for what will likely be one of the most challenging years in the show’s history. As the presidential election approaches, he has tapped Jim Carrey to play former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee. And on Thursday, NBC planned to announce that the Oct. 3 season premiere will be hosted by Chris Rock, the comedian, actor and “S.N.L.” alumnus, and will feature musical performances by Megan Thee Stallion. There are, of course, countless other considerations that Michaels and his colleagues are currently reckoning with as they prepare to bring the show back. They are acclimating to new realities of frequent testing and potential risk, and, as Michaels explained in a phone interview on Wednesday afternoon, the success of their efforts is in no way assured. “We don’t know that we’re going to be able to pull it off,” he said. “We’re going to be as surprised as everyone else when it actually goes on.” Michaels spoke further about how “S.N.L.” was getting ready for its first live episodes since the spring and the measures the show was taking to continue during the pandemic. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. What is it like to be back in your offices after all these months? Things have changed. There’s heat sensors at the revolving doors and then you go for your rapid [Covid] test. You wait 15 minutes and then you’re in the building. The Monday night meetings in my office on the 17th floor, which once had 40 people, now has a capacity of three. It’s me plus two. In the same way that we tried to figure out the at-home shows, we’ve had to rethink every part of the show. Did you contemplate the possibility of starting the new season with more remotely produced episodes, rather than resuming with live broadcasts? No, we just had to go back. It’s an election year. It’s what we do. There are four [presidential and vice-presidential] debates in the month of October, and I was trying to figure out how to take a week off, but it didn’t work out. So we’ll do five shows in a row, which we’ve never done, and under these circumstances. Everybody has just thrown themselves into it. It’s difficult, but we’ve done difficult a lot of times. Comedy, when there’s a little danger involved, it doesn’t necessarily suffer. Obviously, I take my responsibility for people’s health and lives very seriously. But we did a show with anthrax in the building. We did a show after 9/11. That’s what we’ve always done. To our audience, it’s really important we show up. What has been different about the day-to-day process of making the show so far? I had a meeting with the writing staff. I had a meeting with the cast. I had a meeting with production. The room that we were in was the size of an airplane hangar and people were six feet apart and everyone wears their masks. We can’t go in with as many pieces. We don’t have as much time between dress [rehearsal] and air. We’re doing our first read-throughs on Tuesdays as opposed to Wednesdays. Will cast members have to wear masks in the sketches? They will wear masks until the moment the red light goes on, at which point the Velcro back will be taken off. Are there limitations as to how many people can be in a sketch? No, but there are restrictions on how many people you can have on the studio floor. So, if a camera’s not in use in that sketch, the operator would leave. When sets have to be changed and the stagehands come in to do it, others will leave. We have a finite number of people and that’s being closely monitored. What happens if someone at the show tests positive? Everyone goes into quarantine for two weeks if you test positive. So right now, everyone at the show — performers, writers, behind-the-scenes staff — is getting the rapid Covid test? Absolutely. And eventually audience. Will you be able to draw your studio audience from the general public, or is that going to be restricted to NBC colleagues and family members? That’s all still being sorted out.
