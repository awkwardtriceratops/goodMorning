Agency Says<br></h1><p id="artcont">About 200 migrants were aboard a boat that caught fire and capsized on Saturday, hours after it had left Senegal for the Canary Islands, according to the International Organization for Migration. By Michael Levenson At least 140 people drowned when a boat carrying migrants sank off the Senegalese coast over the weekend in the deadliest shipwreck this year, the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations agency, said on Thursday. The boat had left Mbour, a coastal town in western Senegal, on Saturday with about 200 migrants, bound for the Canary Islands. But it caught fire a few hours later and capsized in the Atlantic Ocean near St.-Louis, on Senegal’s northwest coast, the agency said. The Senegalese and Spanish navies, as well as nearby fishermen, managed to rescue 59 people and recover the remains of 20 others, according to the International Organization for Migration, which cited news reports. The organization said it was deeply saddened by the shipwreck, which came after four ships carrying migrants sank in the Central Mediterranean last week and one other sank in the English Channel. “We call for unity between governments, partners and the international community to dismantle trafficking and smuggling networks that take advantage of desperate youth,” Bakary Doumbia, the agency’s chief of mission in Senegal, said in a statement. “It is also important that we advocate for enhanced legal channels to undermine the traffickers’ business model and prevent loss of life,” he said. The shipwreck came as the number of migrants making the dangerous sea crossing from West Africa to the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago, has increased significantly in recent weeks, according to the International Organization for Migration. About 11,000 migrants have reached the Canary Islands this year, compared with 2,557 during the same period last year, the agency said. At least 414 people have died along the route, up from 210 last year, the organization said.
