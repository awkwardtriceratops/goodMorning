Here are two programs, thousands of miles apart, that have helped get them involved. By Tina Rosenberg Ms. Rosenberg is a co-founder of the Solutions Journalism Network, which supports rigorous reporting about responses to social problems. If schools across the United States return to “normal” in January, the average student will have lost nearly seven months of learning. But the low-income students among them will have lost more than a year. Parents must be part of the solution. But the yawning gap between rich and poor that existed even before the pandemic also affects parental involvement. The conventional wisdom in schools is that low-income parents don’t get involved. Now, they need to be super-involved. “There is no going around parents anymore,” said Alejandro Gibes de Gac, founder and chief executive of Springboard Collaborative, a Philadelphia-based organization that trains parents to be reading coaches. To make sure students continue to learn, he said, “we’ve got to work with and through them.” That’s even more true in low-income countries, many of which have no instruction during the pandemic at all. Globally, Covid-19 could cost students $10 trillion in earnings over the course of their lifetimes, according to the World Bank. Here, we’ll look at two approaches to engaging parents — one used here in the United States by Springboard and one used in Botswana — that can help children learn in a few weeks what normally takes months or years of schooling. Springboard’s premise is that all parents are eager to help their children. But they need skills and confidence. “About a third of families can’t read the book their child is holding — either because of language or literacy,” Mr. Gibes de Gac said. So how can they teach their child? One strategy for young children that Springboard uses doesn’t require literacy from the parents; it’s called the book walk. First, choose an illustrated book and look at the pictures with your child, then ask (in any language) “What do you think is happening?” As the child reads the text, ask her about what’s going on. Afterward, ask her what happened, and if her ideas were right. Using these and other strategies, Springboard’s five-week summer program helps parents coach their children to reading gains that normally take more than three months. When Covid-19 hit, Springboard ramped up. The group trained 3,000 incoming Teach for America members. Freed from geographical constraints, Springboard went from working in 62 schools to 667. For families outside those schools, Springboard created an app and a four-week home plan with free e-books. Springboard can’t assess its virtual programs until schools resume testing kids. But they know families attend workshops. Turnout averages 91 percent — and in some places, such as Washington, D.C., attendance has been 99 percent, Mr. Gibes de Gac said. Among the families Springboard works with now, Gibes de Gac said that parents read more with their children than did parents in the in-person program: 26 minutes per day, as opposed to 22. The longer a child reads with a parent, the more she learns. Barbara Mosley, who cares for her 7-year-old granddaughter, Cutora Bright, uses the app to supplement the Springboard program in Cutora’s school, Detroit Leadership Academy. Cutora got a laptop from the school, and Springboard gave her access to an online library. Her teacher met with students remotely three times a week. Ms. Mosley got a daily text with tips — for example, “Have your child make facial expressions relating to what she reads.” “I’m not computer savvy. They just made the steps pretty simple,” Ms. Mosley said. She said the best tip was asking Cutora to describe different characters in the book.
