Here’s What We Know<br></h1><p id="artcont">A man was shot and killed after supporters of President Trump clashed with counterprotesters. By Bryan Pietsch Portland, Ore., has had nightly protests since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. On Saturday night, a caravan of supporters of President Trump traveled through the city, clashing with counterprotesters. A man was shot and killed during the unrest. Here’s what we know so far. What happened in Portland? Supporters of the president gathered on Saturday at a shopping center a few miles southeast of Portland. The caravan of hundreds of trucks then traveled into the city. Most were flying “Trump 2020” or thin blue line flags, which are commonly associated with support for the police and often seen as antithetical to the Black Lives Matter movement. The caravan clashed with counterprotesters at times. People shot paintball guns from trucks and protesters threw objects at them. Some conflicts devolved into fistfights in the streets. A video showed a small group in the street, where gunfire erupts and a man collapses. Police Chief Chuck Lovell said the caravan stretched for miles and there were pockets of violence. The police tried to take precautionary measures to prevent vehicles from making their way downtown. “We have limited resources,” Chief Lovell said at a news conference on Sunday. “We can’t be everywhere at the same time.” Portland police officers heard reports of gunfire shortly before 9 p.m. local time and found a man with a gunshot wound to the chest, the police said. Medical responders determined that the man was dead, the police said. Officials asked people to not jump to conclusions about what happened and to stay away from Portland as some have expressed a desire to seek retribution.
