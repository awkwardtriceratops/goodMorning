By Carl Slater Mr. Slater is a delegate to the Navajo Nation Council. On Aug. 26, the federal government plans to execute Lezmond Mitchell, 38, the only American Indian under a federal death sentence. This a profound insult to Navajo sovereignty. I am a leader of the Navajo Nation, and along with its president, vice president and legislative branch, I call on President Trump to commute his sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of release.
