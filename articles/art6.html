By Gail Collins and Bret Stephens Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every week. Bret Stephens: Well, Gail, it was another slow news week. Donald Trump and Joe Biden had a televised conversation and then the president caught some sort of cold. We’ll have to stick to boring subjects. The 25th Amendment, anyone? Gail Collins: We obviously want to begin by expressing heartfelt wishes for the president’s recovery. One of the goals of this election is reminding the world that this is not a country that believes a politician who’s terrible at his job should suffer physically. Bret: One hundred percent. Get well, Mr. President: We sincerely wish you good health, long life and the full use of your taste buds in order to savor electoral defeat. Gail: Last night, as I was trying to send positive thoughts toward the presidential sickroom, America’s most famous patient got in a car and rode around waving to supporters. I’m sure it cheered him up. But once again, not a great example to give everybody else. Of course it’s important for us all to wish him good health, but it’s impossible to ignore for one minute the fact that he spent the fall — and the debate a mere week ago — making fun of people who wear masks.
