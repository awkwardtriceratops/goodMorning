By Alan Blinder Nick Saban, the football coach at the University of Alabama and one of the most powerful figures in college sports, said Wednesday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, deepening the pandemic’s turmoil throughout the Southeastern Conference. Saban, whose second-ranked team is scheduled to host No. 3 Georgia on Saturday, said in a statement that he was asymptomatic and isolating at his home in Tuscaloosa. Alabama’s athletic director, Greg Byrne, also tested positive, the university said. “Both immediately left the facility and went to their homes to self-isolate after receiving that information,” Dr. Jimmy Robinson, Alabama’s team doctor, and Jeff Allen, the football team’s head athletic trainer, said in a statement. “At this point in time, the positive tests are limited to those two individuals. All individuals who are considered high risk contacts have been notified and will follow quarantine guidelines.” During a news conference conducted via Zoom on Wednesday night, Saban, seemingly alone and wearing a face mask around his neck, said that he had been “very surprised” by the positive result, which Alabama detected during its daily testing for its football program. “I personally think I did a really good job of trying to manage my personal space,” Saban said. “And that would be what I’ve informed our players to try to do because you have to respect this disease and the spread of this disease.” Saban, who is 68, suggested that he could have contracted the virus when Alabama visited Mississippi last weekend, echoing concerns from others in college football that travel may pose some of the greatest risks to the season. Still, the announcement from Alabama, which had spent months saying vanishingly little about the spread of the pathogen within its athletic department, was a fresh shock to a league grappling with its most perilous week of virus-related crises. On Wednesday, the conference postponed Saturday’s game between Florida and Louisiana State after at least 21 Florida players and two assistant coaches tested positive for the virus. Florida said it would have had fewer than 50 scholarship players available for the game in Gainesville, Fla., which was below the league’s minimum of 53. Earlier in the week, the SEC said a contest between Missouri and Vanderbilt would be delayed until December because of an outbreak at Vanderbilt. But word that Saban, who has been an active public proponent of wearing masks and enforcing social distancing, tested positive may have far greater reverberations on the sport and the perceptions of playing it during the pandemic, in part because of the renown he has cultivated during his 14 seasons at Alabama.
