By Edgar Sandoval Derek Trucios was still a high school student, just 17, but he already was talking about going to medical school. He had finished his online courses on Wednesday afternoon and was strolling with a 16-year-old friend down a residential Brooklyn street when a man in a black ski mask came up to them. The man had a gun. The teenagers refused to hand over their belongings, the police said. The man shot Mr. Trucios in the head and chest. His friend was hit in the hands and back. Mr. Trucios died at a nearby hospital. “He had just started discussing his dreams of studying medicine,” said his father, Emmanuel Trucios, 39, an immigrant from Puebla, Mexico, who works in construction. “He wanted to help people. I wanted to see him do great things, like any father.” The teenager had celebrated his 17th birthday last week. “That man doesn’t know what he took from us,” Emmanuel Trucios said in Spanish. “He took the best son we could have ever asked for.” A day after the seemingly random attack, investigators were still trying to determine if robbery was the motive or there was some other cause, said a law enforcement official who was briefed on the case. The shooting — at 2:33 p.m. outside 436 East 26th Street in Flatbush — was one of the latest incidents in a rising tide of gun violence in the nation’s largest city that has taken a heavy toll on young New Yorkers.
