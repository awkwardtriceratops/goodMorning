It’s a metaphor for what is happening to much of this country. By Maria Antonova Ms. Antonova is a journalist and science writer. BALASHIKHA, Russia — Take any of the many highways out of the Russian capital and you can dissect the country’s strata like rings on a tree. Sentinel apartment towers replace the bustling illuminated center, then the belt of auto dealerships and box stores drifts by. Gradually, the landscape becomes sparse, with villages and towns sporadically punctuating the stretch of meadows and forests for thousands of miles in every direction. Russia is the biggest country on Earth and both the state and the people take pride in the size of its territory — “from the southern seas to the polar fringes,” as the current national anthem goes. That quiet emptiness, the enormity of Russia, has been infiltrated in recent decades by an alien force: the giant hogweed. This invader, an exceptionally tall plant with a toxic sap that can cause third-degree burns and blindness, has come to symbolize the fate of rural Russia: malign neglect by the government. While Russia may be vast, most economic activity — and much of life in general — is concentrated in a handful of cities. And after various Soviet-era attempts to develop land through centralized planning, there is evidence that the current government is doing the exact opposite. Enter the hogweed. In the summer, the giant hogweed assumes the look of dill on steroids; its coffee-table sized leaves create thickets impossible to pass without a hazmat suit. In the winter, it desiccates into a brown skeleton. Outside Moscow, the hogweeds are often the only visible landmarks over white fields, ominous umbrellas standing in the snow like War of the Worlds troops poised to march. Officials have begun to refer to overgrown areas as “contaminated.” Giant hogweeds grow naturally in the Caucasus Mountains. Evolving to thrive on shifting soils, they compete with other high-altitude herbage by yielding extraordinary seed counts — up to 100,000 per plant. The plant’s Latin name, Heracleum, hints at its extraordinary strength. In Central Russia, where typical meadow grasses are much shorter, it quickly overpowers all local species. “Our plants cannot compete with it,” Dmitry Geltman, the director of the Komarov Botanical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told me. “It takes over deserted fields because it likes unstable soil. For any alien species, it is easier to infiltrate a fluctuating community.” Mr. Geltman speaks in botanical terms, but he could be talking about life in rural Russia, which has experienced a relentless population exodus since the 1990s. Russia has some 222 million hectares of agricultural land, nearly 100 million of which are unused, according to a 2016 census. Much of this vast territory — 386,000 square miles, about twice the size of Spain — was abandoned after the breakup of the Soviet Union because it was unprofitable to farm. As humans left, the hogweed advanced. It seems the government doesn’t know what to do with the land, or the people on it: Rural Russians are twice as poor and jobless as those living in urban areas. Research has shown that the number of farms in the country halved between 2006 and 2016. The top 1 percent of all agricultural companies receive two-thirds of all investment — just 61 companies collectively own over 14 million hectares of farmland and prefer to use seasonal migrant labor. Rural Russians are shut out of economic opportunity.
