By Ruth Maclean DAKAR, Senegal — Mali’s military staged a coup and arrested the country’s president on Tuesday, after weeks of unrest that convulsed the West African nation, diplomats said. President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta and his prime minister, Boubou Cissé, were arrested along with other government officials, according to Moussa Faki, chairman of the African Union Commission, who called for them to be freed immediately. The turmoil came amid a growing protest movement driven by charges that the government of President Keita had stolen a Parliamentary election in March and installed his own candidates. Demonstrators have also been angered by the government’s failure to address corruption and the bloodshed that has plagued the country for eight years. Hundreds of protesters gathered at Bamako’s Independence Square, blowing vuvuzelas and revving motorcycles in what appeared to be a spontaneous demonstration. “Goodbye, I.B.K.,” read a placard, using Mr. Keita’s nickname. “Long live Mali.” Mali has been in crisis since 2012, when rebels and jihadists took control of the country’s north. Despite the intervention of foreign forces and United Nations peacekeepers, the unrest has spread. Led by a coalition of politicians, civil society leaders and a popular imam, Mahmoud Dicko, Malians have risen up to demand Mr. Keita’s resignation, descending by the thousands onto Bamako’s streets. In mid June, security forces shot and killed at least 11 protesters in violence that further convulsed the protest movement. The turmoil represents a sharp change in fortunes for the once-popular president, who won a landslide election in 2013 in the wake of a military coup. Attempts at mediation by regional leaders, led by the former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan, had failed to dampen the protest movement. The prime minister, Mr. Cissé, had released a statement earlier on Tuesday calling for “reason and patriotism, and for the guns to be silenced.” There was no problem that could not be solved by dialogue, he said, taking a conciliatory tone. “The government calls for appeasement and is available to engage in fraternal dialogue in order to dispel any misunderstandings,” the statement read. A government official said that he saw soldiers arrive in pickup trucks and arrest the finance minister in his office on Tuesday morning, and local media reported that the president of the national assembly was taken from his home. Ecowas, the union of West African countries, confirmed that the mutiny had taken place and called for the soldiers to “return to barracks,” saying it was opposed to any unconstitutional political change. The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, also condemned the mutiny in a statement. Early on Tuesday, the Norwegian ambassador sent out a message saying there had been warnings of a mutiny in the armed forces, and the French Embassy posted a message on Twitter warning people to stay at home. “Given the tensions reported this morning, August 18, in Kati and Bamako, we urgently recommend that you stay at home,” read the post. Peter Pham, U.S. special envoy for the Sahel region, said in a post on Twitter: “The US opposes any extra-constitutional change of government, whether by those on the streets or by the defense and security forces.” Cheick Amadou Diouara contributed reporting from Gao, Mali. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
