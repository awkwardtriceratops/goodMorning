By Jennifer Weiner Contributing Opinion Writer PHILADELPHIA — On Tuesday afternoon, it was Karla texting my husband. On Saturday, it was Carin and Britney. Mara got in touch the next day. Susan and Debra reached out last week. Normally, I would look askance at strange ladies blowing up my husband’s phone. But I know these women don’t want his time or his affections. They (and Julia, and Debra No. 2) want his vote. Our phones aren’t the only things that have been crammed with election-year come-ons. An average day’s mail brings at least two pieces of campaign literature, plus a guide or two on how to correctly complete a mail-in ballot. On the digital front, Trump and Biden ads have invaded my YouTube feed and colonized my husband’s Scrabble app. I try to do yoga: There’s Joe Biden. He wants to watch football: There’s Donald Trump. The real world offers no respite. In Center City, my neighborhood, people walk the streets wearing “Bad Things Happen in Philadelphia” T-shirts, an ironic appropriation of President Trump’s statement from the first debate. The lampposts bristle with “MAKE A PLAN: VOTE” placards. In Limerick, a suburb an hour to the northwest, one voter told me, “It seems the Trump supporters feel the need to show who loves him the most by having the biggest and ‘most tremendous’ signs.” She says it’s the profanity that really gets to her, like the truck emblazoned with the slogan “Trump 2020 — [expletive] Your Feelings” in the pickup line at school. The candidates and their surrogates are pouring in: Cory Booker and Andrew Yang on Sunday, Mike Pence on Monday, Mr. Trump and Donald Jr. on Tuesday, Barack Obama on Wednesday. So is the money: Since the beginning of the election, the campaigns have lavished close to $200 million on Pennsylvania — $121.5 million from Team Biden, $74.2 million from Team Trump. Welcome to life in a swing state, with less than two weeks until the election. If you’ve ever felt starved for attention, ignored by the good and the great, come sit by me in Pennsylvania. “It’s like being the most popular kid in high school,” a political ad maker, J.J. Balaban, said in an interview. “Everyone wants to talk to you.” As political junkies know, Mr. Trump won the Keystone State by a mere 44,000 votes. But that tiny handful of voters, and similar handfuls in Michigan and Wisconsin were enough to eke out an Electoral College victory. Current polls show Mr. Trump is trailing in Pennsylvania. And Pennsylvania matters, as he might say, bigly. Right now, according to the political analysis website FiveThirtyEight’s presidential forecast, Pennsylvania is by far the likeliest state to provide either President Trump or Joe Biden with enough votes to carry the Electoral College. So who’s it going to be? When I stay happily in my bubble in Center City, where the Biden posters are rivaled only by the “Black Lives Matter” signs, it’s hard not to be lulled into a sense of security, to think that the polls are right and that the Democrats have it in the bag. Then I drive my teenager to the D.M.V. in Dublin, an hour north, and find the roads lined with cheering, honking, whooping Trump supporters, and I remember that there is another Pennsylvania. Back in 1986, the political consultant James Carville famously said (to paraphrase slightly) that Pennsylvania is Philadelphia to the east, Pittsburgh to the west and Alabama in between. That certainly felt like the case in the early 1990s, when I worked at a small newspaper in central Pennsylvania. The local schools closed on the first day of deer hunting season, and subscribers were invited to drive by and pose for a picture with their kill. For days, I got used to seeing cars and pickup trucks swing into the parking lot with camouflage-clad folks behind the wheel and dead deer draped over their roofs. It felt like a different world than the one I’d grown up in, where nobody hunted and no one I knew had guns. My state is no longer that simple (if it ever was). Not all hunters vote Republican. Not all city dwellers vote Democratic. There are Biden signs on the lawns of a few brave Democrats in red neighborhoods. There are, undoubtedly, some quiet Trump voters, even in bluer-than-blue Center City. Which is perhaps why even my house — with two registered Democrats! — is receiving Trump literature in the mail and why even my 12-year-old daughter’s getting “make sure you have a plan to vote!” texts. As Election Day draws closer, both campaigns are desperately, frantically trying to woo us, with both sides rallying the base, shaking the trees for new voters and hoping that mail-in voters cast their ballots correctly. It is all, frankly, exhausting. Or as Larry Ceisler, a head of a statewide public affairs consulting firm and longtime observer of Pennsylvania politics, told me, “Part of me just wants to go to sleep for the next two weeks.” I’ve already sent in my ballot, and per the state’s website (not that I was obsessively checking or anything), it has been received. My husband is still waiting for his ballot to arrive. He’s placing frequent calls to the Board of Elections, which is telling him that his ballot’s in the mail, and he’s now half-convinced that his ballot will never arrive. I’m having nightmares that I screwed up my envelopes. That’s when I’m not regretting my decision to forgo in-person voting and fretting about a “red mirage” scenario. We are both kind of freaking out. I can’t wait until it’s over. When I can go back to worrying about my kids instead of my ballot. When the texts will taper off, the signs will come down, the phone calls will cease, and Pennsylvanians won’t matter any more or less than anyone else. It’s what no one tells you about being the popular kid — when everyone wants you, the thing you end up wanting most is just to be left alone.
