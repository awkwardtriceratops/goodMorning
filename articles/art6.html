By Ruth Graham Jerry Falwell Jr. is out as president and chancellor of Liberty University, the influential evangelical institution founded by his father in 1971. The departure was the culmination of a chaotic 48 hours that began Sunday night, when Mr. Falwell issued a statement claiming that his wife, Becki, had a sexual relationship with a man who later tried to extort the couple in exchange for silence. The statement appeared to anticipate an interview with Reuters that appeared the next day, in which the man, Giancarlo Granda, claimed he met Ms. Falwell regularly for sexual liaisons, with Mr. Falwell looking on. Mr. Granda denied the claim of extortion. The sordid details resulted in swift action from the Christian university’s conservative board of trustees, handpicked for their loyalty to Mr. Falwell and his father, Jerry Falwell Sr., though Mr. Falwell’s departure was as rocky as his recent tenure at the school. On Monday afternoon, he told the board and reporters that he was resigning but then abruptly reversed course, before eventually sending a resignation letter late in the evening. The board’s executive committee met on Tuesday morning and voted to accept Mr. Falwell’s resignation immediately. The full board then convened an emergency conference call and unanimously confirmed Mr. Falwell’s departure. He will receive severance as dictated by his employment agreement, according to the board’s statement, which did not specify the amount. He also resigned from his seat on the board. Mr. Falwell suggested he was happy to move on. “The quote that keeps going through my mind this morning is Martin Luther King Jr: ‘Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty I’m free at last,’” he told a Lynchburg newspaper reporter on Tuesday afternoon. Mr. Falwell did not respond to requests for comment from The New York Times. On campus in Lynchburg, Va., and beyond, many Liberty students and others with ties to the school greeted the departure with similar relief. “I think everybody has been waiting for this,” Brooke Smoke, a senior English major, said. “Thank God, the witch is dead.” Mr. Falwell turned Liberty into a hugely influential institution with a national profile and a $1.6 billion endowment. But he also found himself at the center of a constant flow of controversies. In the wake of a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., in 2015, he told students at an all-campus gathering that if more people had concealed-carry gun permits, “we could end those Muslims before they walked in.” He depicted himself as a provocateur on Twitter, where he often insulted other Christian leaders. And his brickbats attracted increasing media attention after his surprise endorsement of Donald J. Trump for president in early 2016. Monday was the first day of classes for the fall semester at Liberty. On a campus where class sessions often open in prayer, some professors referred to the uncertainty of the moment, and encouraged students to pray for both the institution’s future and the Falwell family. The campus pastor, David Nasser, posted a tweet to remind students that the campus chapel was open 24 hours a day for prayer and counsel. Mr. Nasser was to address students directly at a worship service on Wednesday evening. Mr. Falwell had been on leave since Aug. 7, following backlash to a photograph he posted to Instagram in which he posed with his pants partially unzipped and his arm around a young woman he later said was his wife’s assistant. He was holding a glass of dark liquid that he joked in the caption was “just black water.” Students and faculty at Liberty are forbidden from consuming alcohol, and the student honor code encourages students to follow “common-sense guidelines to avoid the appearance of impropriety.” In their statement announcing Mr. Falwell’s departure, board members emphasized their spiritual responsibilities. “I am so encouraged by the unity of Christ that I saw exemplified by our board today,” said Allen McFarland, the board’s acting chair. “Liberty University’s future is very bright and in capable hands of leaders who are committed to being good stewards of what the Lord has entrusted.” Jerry Prevo, a retired pastor who has been serving as acting president during Mr. Falwell’s leave of absence, said he intended to nurture students’ “spiritual side.” Mr. Prevo will remain in the role of acting president indefinitely. Mr. Granda has said he met the Falwells in 2012 while he was a 20-year-old in Miami Beach. The Falwell family later entered into an unusual business arrangement with Mr. Granda, making him a partner when they invested nearly $2 million in a Miami youth hostel. The tawdry details of the latest scandal involving Mr. Granda ensured that the news spread quickly on the campus of 15,000 residential students. John Sharp Jr., a sophomore majoring in business administration, said he and colleagues on campus had listened to a 2018 audio clip, published by Reuters, purported to be of a conversation between Mr. Falwell, his wife and Mr. Granda. In it, someone identified as Mr. Falwell jokingly said that Mr. Granda’s relationships with other women might make Ms. Falwell jealous. “We just listened with our jaws open,” Mr. Sharp said. “We’ve heard Jerry and Becki’s voices many times in Convo,” he said, referring to the university’s twice-weekly gatherings of students. “It was unmistakably their voices.” Several students said it was time for a change in the leadership at the university. “We almost had a monarchy, but you don’t see that at any other university, where presidents are chosen based on their skills and abilities,” said Tavia Bruxellas, a senior who is president of the student government Senate. “Everybody just sees Liberty as this big Republican university, and students are really tired of that.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
