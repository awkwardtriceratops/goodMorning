By Marie Tae McDermott Good morning. Record-setting wildfires in California have leveled entire communities and displaced thousands of residents. As the fires continue to burn, relief organizations are on the ground providing support for victims and emergency workers. For those looking to help people affected by the wildfires, we’ve compiled a list of organizations operating in the state. Remember, unsolicited donations of items like food can actually overwhelm relief organizations, so it’s best to check what is needed before giving.

You can also consult GuideStar or Charity Navigator for a list of trustworthy organizations that are working to provide aid to wildfire victims.
