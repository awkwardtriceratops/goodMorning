By Charles M. Blow Opinion Columnist We are now entering the homestretch. Voters will finally have a say in whether Donald Trump’s reign of terror and idiocy continues or ends. Tens of millions of Americans have already made their choices known by voting early. For many of us, this day could not come soon enough. For many of us, we quite literally weren’t sure if we, or the country, or the world even, could survive four years of a Donald Trump presidency. I can still remember election night 2016. I was in my office at The New York Times on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. I was prepared to write something about the results, as I had done in 2008 after Barack Obama’s first victory.

I walked down Eighth Avenue and then Seventh. Occasionally I’d stop at a restaurant or a bar that had televisions turned to the channels tracking the results. Every time a state was called in Trump’s favor, people reacted in horror. I ended up settling in at a familiar restaurant and ordering dinner at the bar so that I could follow the rest of the results on the television that hung just above it.
