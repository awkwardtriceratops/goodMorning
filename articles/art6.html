By Elisabeth Rosenthal Contributing Opinion Writer I was a reporter in Rome in 2005 when Italy banned smoking in restaurants. I was skeptical. For many Italians, having a cigarette with after-dinner coffee was simply part of the meal, like dessert. Also, Italians are famously lax about following rules: They dodge their taxes and park on sidewalks. As I wrote in these pages: “Smokers declared — basta! — they would never comply.” But to my shock (and ease-of-breathing, since I have asthma), very quickly everyone did. If the Italians could do it with cigarettes, how come so many people in the United States aren’t following relatively simple mandates to prevent the spread of Covid-19, which has killed more than 200,000 Americans? Thirty-four states and Washington, D.C., have some sort of mask mandate, but many citizens and law enforcement agencies are blatantly ignoring them. Earlier this month, President Trump held an indoor rally with thousands of mostly unmasked supporters in Henderson, Nev., in violation of a state mandate that prohibits gatherings of more than 50 people. Last week, Mr. Trump held a rally in an airport hangar outside Pittsburgh, where thousands of mostly maskless people were crammed, cheering, cheek-to-jowl — even though the governor had asked the campaign to follow the state’s Covid-19 rules on mask use and social distancing. An infectious disease doctor in Florida told me she felt safest when she was in the hospital because, she estimated, fewer than a fifth of the people in her community were masking or social distancing in stores, despite a mask mandate. Some right-wing groups have challenged governors’ broad authority to order Covid-19 prevention measures. Last week, a judge appointed by Mr. Trump overturned Pennsylvania’s limits on gatherings. But the legal standing is relatively clear. “Governors absolutely have the authority during a public health emergency to make laws — to force people to wear masks, to limit gatherings,” said Jaime King, an expert on health law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law. “So I’m perplexed at why people say, ‘You can’t force me.’” People who act as if these rules are optional might point to a double standard, asking why they should have to obey when others — like the protesters against racial injustice this summer — didn’t. But at the protests I observed in Washington and New York City, everyone was wearing masks and mostly kept at least three feet apart, outdoors and moving. Yes, some people broke curfews, but there were very visible attempts at enforcement. Mark Hall, a professor of law and public health at Wake Forest University, noted that there are what he calls “hortatory laws” — laws that are more about encouraging social norms rather than mandating behavior. But, he said, those involve “trivial” trespasses. “This does seem like a law that has much more serious consequences,” he said about the masking measures. “It’s not J-walking or loitering or pooper scooping.” Maybe people just don’t like masks. But we routinely obey — and police officers routinely enforce — laws with which we don’t entirely agree.
