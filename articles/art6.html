The shooting took place in the early-morning hours of Nov. 23 at the Stratford Inn in Ashland, Ore., about 180 miles south of Eugene, the police said. A guest at the inn, Robert Paul Keegan, 47, left his room because he thought someone was playing music too loudly in the lot outside, according to the police. After an argument, Mr. Keegan, who is white, “pulled a gun from his coat and fired a single shot” into the victim’s chest, the police said in a statement. “Ashland Fire and Rescue responded to the scene to attempt to render aid, however the man was beyond help,” the police said. Chief Tighe O’Meara of the Ashland Police Department identified the victim as Aiden Ellison, 19, though a friend and a woman who answered the phone at Ashland High School, where Mr. Ellison was a student, said his first name was Aidan, with two A’s.
