Is Set to Execute Native American Prisoner<br></h1><p id="artcont">Lezmond Mitchell faces the death penalty for his part in the 2001 murder of a Navajo woman and her 9-year-old granddaughter, a case that has raised issues about tribal sovereignty. By Hailey Fuchs WASHINGTON — The Justice Department intends on Wednesday to execute the only Native American man on federal death row, despite urgent pleas from more than a dozen tribes to respect Navajo culture and spare his life. The inmate, Lezmond Mitchell, 38, faces the death penalty for his part in the 2001 murder of a Navajo woman, Alyce Slim, and her 9-year-old granddaughter, Tiffany Lee. Barring any last-minute stays, his execution would be the first time a Native American man has been put to death by the federal government for a crime committed against another Native American on a reservation. Tribal activists have argued that Mr. Mitchell’s case exemplifies the fraught relationship between tribes and federal law enforcement, which often disregards protections for tribal sovereignty. Members of the Navajo Nation say that their teachings condemn murder as a means for vengeance and emphasize the sanctity of human life, and that the family of Mr. Mitchell’s victims initially opposed the death penalty before changing their position to support executing him. The Justice Department secured Mr. Mitchell’s conviction through a loophole that allowed it to ignore Navajo preferences. The Justice Department has carried out three executions this summer, after a nearly two decade-long informal moratorium on federal capital punishment. The move echoed one of President Trump’s early campaign promises, to be “tough on crime,” language he has deployed again in his re-election bid. Hundreds of Native American citizens have called for the administration to spare Mr. Mitchell. Jonathan Nez, the president of the Navajo Nation, pleaded with the Office of the Pardon Attorney in a closed oral presentation this month to commute Mr. Mitchell’s sentence. In a letter to the president, Mr. Nez and Myron Lizer, the vice president of the Navajo Nation, called on the White House to convert Mr. Mitchell’s sentence to life without the possibility of parole and to respect the tribe’s traditional beliefs. Marlene Slim, the mother and daughter of the victims, initially testified against the death penalty. However, she has since walked back that position. Lawyers for the family said in a statement, “Mr. Mitchell’s attorneys or advocates and the Navajo Nation do not speak for these victims.” The effort to impose the federal criminal justice system on reservations dates to at least the 1880s, when a man named Crow Dog was convicted in both tribal and federal courts of killing a fellow member of his tribe. The two systems clashed: In tribal court, Crow Dog was sentenced to pay restitution; in federal court, he was sentenced to death.
