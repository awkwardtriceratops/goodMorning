Others felt like they were living inside a pressure cooker. By Taylor Trudon It started with a yoga class, a stroll through a secondhand bookstore in Berkeley, Calif., and a rapidly accelerating pandemic. After just eight dates — just over a month after they met — Scott Lucas, a deputy editor at BuzzFeed News, and Lyz Keating, a public health professional, decided to move in together. They went to Target, purchased a large coffee maker and stocked up on laundry detergent. For the next six months, they split time between their two apartments. “A couple weeks into it, we kind of looked up and were like, ‘We’re living together?’” said Ms. Keating, 34. Today, the couple shares a one-bedroom in Oakland, Calif., with Ms. Keating’s dog and a newly adopted kitten. “It was a big decision, and in some ways, the big decisions are easy decisions,” said Mr. Lucas, also 34. (Mr. Lucas and Ms. Keating recently purchased an engagement ring.) Whirlwind domestic bliss hasn’t been the case for everyone this year. Life has been tough. A new Pew Research Center survey found that 1 in 4 American adults are struggling to pay their bills. Guides on how to survive cohabiting in close quarters with romantic partners (and parents, and kids) proliferate online. Divorce rates skyrocketed in China in March after couples emerged from lockdown. But some relationships, confined to tight quarters, have had room to bloom. Sarah Corley, a 33-year-old digital marketer, and Adam Emma, a 33-year-old project architect, went on five dates before Chicago issued a stay-at-home order. They decided to trade off extended weekends at each other’s places until lockdown lifted. “It was kind of an incubator for this beautiful thing we had started to develop,” Ms. Corley said, referring to the “safe haven” she and Mr. Emma built for themselves. “We got to know each other very deeply, very quickly.” Shelley Sather, 46, was used to an independent lifestyle, living alone since she was 19. But that changed when she met her boyfriend at an ethnography conference in Rhode Island last November. The two learned they lived 11 minutes from each other in Brooklyn.
