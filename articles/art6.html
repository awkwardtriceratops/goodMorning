A suspect was in custody, but information on a motive was not immediately available. By Yonette Joseph and Yan Zhuang Two people were stabbed to death and others injured on Sunday night at a church in San Jose, Calif., the police said. There were “multiple stabbing victims,” the San Jose police said on Twitter. No services were being held at the time of the attack at Grace Baptist Church, which was first reported at 7:53 p.m., reports said. The police added that “unhoused individuals” had been taken to the church to get them out of the cold. The police said on Twitter on Monday morning that they had a suspect in custody and promised to release more details soon. The church is near the campus of San Jose State University, according to local news reports. It runs a winter shelter program to get homeless people shelter when the temperature drops, and houses up to 50 men and women at a time, according to its website. The program usually runs from January to April but was extended this year to help people during the coronavirus pandemic, the website said. It is unclear whether this is the same program referred to by the police. It was 52 degrees Fahrenheit at the time of the first report of the attack, according to the National Weather Service. “Our hearts are torn for the victims and their loved ones in last night’s horrific stabbing at Grace Baptist Church on 10th Street,” the San Jose mayor, Sam Liccardo, said in a statement on Monday. “We have lost two community members, and we pray for the recovery of the three others seriously injured in that attack.” The police later said they had made no arrests, and would release a statement on Monday morning. No further information on a motive or a suspect was immediately available. San Jose, a city of a little more than one million people, is in Silicon Valley, a major tech hub in the Bay Area of California. This is the fourth fatal stabbing in four months in San Jose. Three men were killed in three separate attacks in August, September and October. Kwame Opam contributed reporting. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
