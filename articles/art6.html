Get over it. Move on.”), and worry about the threat of a coup or replacing electors. To the Editor: Re “Trump Marshals Federal Power to Overturn His Election Defeat” (front page, Nov. 11): President Trump’s outrageous refusal to accept the election results — and the appalling lack of integrity shown by most Republicans, who are apparently willing to risk what’s left of this country’s democratic traditions by once again failing to stand up to Mr. Trump — is even more troubling when viewed in a historical context. Until now, all presidential hopefuls have put the country’s institutions, values and stability before their own ambitions. Four years ago, despite winning three million more votes than Mr. Trump, Hillary Clinton graciously conceded. In 2000, Al Gore accepted the ruling by the Supreme Court that installed George W. Bush as president. It’s bad enough that Mr. Trump won’t concede — no one really expected he would suddenly set aside his autocratic leanings, megalomania and vanity for the good of the nation — but the craven absence of integrity on the part of other Republicans is inexcusable.

Twisp, Wash. To the Editor: It appears that the Republican political hierarchy is waiting for President Trump to go through the five stages of grief before acknowledging Joe Biden’s victory. In other words, they are allowing democratic processes to be put on hold so that Mr. Trump can work through his personal trauma. This is perverse! The coddling of Mr. Trump should not take priority over continuity of government. His damaged psyche should be his problem, not the country’s. Those Republicans may have a long wait. Based on what we’ve seen of Mr. Trump’s emotional range, he is likely to be caught in a loop between denial and anger and never advance any further. In the meantime, the rest of us must move forward, even if it means that there isn’t a single Republican Party leader at Mr. Biden’s inauguration. Robyn Livermore
Sioux Falls, S.D. To the Editor: Since the election, about one million new coronavirus cases were diagnosed in the United States. During that time, other than contesting the election on baseless grounds, President Trump spent a lot of time golfing. Meanwhile, Joe Biden got to work assembling a top-of-the-line task force to fight that virus. Could there be a better comparison of the president-elect versus the president-neglect? Norman L. Bender
Woodbridge, Conn. To the Editor: Re “The Courts Won’t Decide the Election,” by Richard H. Pildes (Op-Ed, Nov. 6): I fear that this election is not at all over, despite the pronouncements of the media and the commentators. Mr. Pildes is surely right that a legal attack on the vote counts per se will not be successful in the courts. He misses the real possibility, however, that in some key swing states with close outcomes in Joe Biden’s favor, the Republican-dominated legislatures may well declare that in view of the controversies over the propriety of the counts, they will have to intervene, resulting in designation of Trump electors. The Supreme Court could well declare that such actions are legal pursuant to the constitutional provision authorizing state legislatures to determine the mode of selecting electors, and the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which seems to give the legislatures considerable discretion in the resolution of such disputes.
