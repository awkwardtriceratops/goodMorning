By John Williams PEN America on Tuesday announced that the playwright and novelist Ayad Akhtar would serve as its next president, succeeding the novelist Jennifer Egan. Mr. Akhtar, who has been on the board of trustees for the nonprofit literary and human rights organization for five years, won the Pulitzer for his play “Disgraced” in 2013, and is publishing a highly anticipated new novel, “Homeland Elegies,” on Sept. 15. He will officially take over the president’s role at PEN America on Dec. 2. I spoke to him about the current debates around free speech and so-called cancel culture, the organization’s new branches across the country, its future priorities and more. These are edited and condensed excerpts from the conversation. There’s been a pivot toward a more domestic focus for the organization since the 2016 election. What do you think of that, and will it continue? I got more involved, in part, because it started to make more sense to me in the wake of Trump’s election, coming from the heartland myself and feeling the pull of making PEN less of a New York-centric organization and more of a national one. There’s been so much focus on writers abroad, but after 2016 we recognized the ways that what we do abroad could work here. What are some of the initiatives you’ve been most involved with at PEN? PEN Across America. In 2016, where I came from, in Milwaukee and the surrounding suburbs, I couldn’t find a single Clinton-Kaine sign anywhere. A lot of folks I grew up with — good folks, smart folks — had a very different idea of what was going on. I think dialogue is a very important thing for us to be engaged in as an organization, and to support communities where there are writers who want to get involved. We’ve opened six satellite chapters that were all started by membership in those communities who wanted to take on that role: Dallas, Austin, Tulsa, Detroit, Birmingham and Greenville, N.C. We’re going to continue to start more chapters across the country. We also had a report about local news that I was involved with — the collapse of local news and the importance of it in the ecosystem. We become prey to disinformation in part because of the lack of locality.
