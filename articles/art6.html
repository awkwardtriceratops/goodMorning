Or check out a beautiful new six-part series about child development. By Margaret Lyons Every Monday and Friday, Margaret offers hyper-specific viewing recommendations in our Watching newsletter. Read her latest picks below, and sign up for the Watching newsletter here. ‘Inside Pixar’
When to watch: Starting Friday, on Disney+. Oh, the enriching joy of behind-the-scenes stories, of seeing the rough drafts of polished gems, of putting voices and faces to names from the credits. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the self-mythologizing that comes out of Pixar is tender and expressive, and these shorts are warmly informative and gently inspiring. Let us all collaborate, express our truest visions, reject “failure” as a concept and grapple with the role high-waisted pants ought to have in our society. There are four episodes, and each contains five vignettes. ‘Becoming You’
When to watch: Starting Friday, on Apple TV+. Prepare to cry a lot during this six-part series about child development; it’s beautiful, but it’s also scientifically engineered to send you into a “they grow up so fast” spiral. Narrated by Olivia Colman, “Becoming You” focuses on the first 2,000 days of children’s lives, and it uses footage of hundreds of kids from across the world as they hit various milestones. Watching all these babies learn to walk, talk, think and interact in all their different ways filled me with so much hope and wonder I felt like a remote and minor but happy god, marveling at all these extraordinary and glorious little beings. ‘Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath’
When to watch: Now, on Netflix or Hulu. The actress Leah Remini was a prominent Scientologist before breaking with the organization in 2013; her book about her experiences came out in 2015, and this fascinating series premiered on A&E in 2016 and won an Emmy in 2017. Now all three seasons are streaming. If you recently watched either of the NXIVM documentaries, or if you’re spending time right now thinking about how people wake from collective delusions, what deprogramming from cults of disinformation might entail, or how people seek and receive forgiveness for abuses enacted at the behest of a charlatan, watch this. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
