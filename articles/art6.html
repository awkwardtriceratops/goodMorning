And Now It Has a Font<br></h1><p id="artcont">The custom-made Goldman Sans is ‘neutral, with a wink’ — or boring and derivative, according to fontheads. By Josh Wagner and Joel Stein There are so few ways to express yourself when you’re Goldman Sachs. Sure, you can commission a 10-part documentary series about your company’s history, and your chief executive can moonlight as a D.J. in the Hamptons. But how do you let the masses know what it’s like to really be you, the bank, in your everyday functions, processing financial spreadsheets and taking companies public? You design your own font. In early June, Goldman Sachs introduced Goldman Sans, a typeface it describes as “approachable without being whimsical” and “neutral, with a wink.” It’s free for anyone to download, and it would appear to be part of a continuing effort by the bank to seem more digital and open: In recent years, Goldman has relaxed its dress code, collaborated with Apple on a credit card and opened an online consumer bank called Marcus. (Technically, Goldman Sans is a typeface, while its component forms — Goldman Sans italic, for example — constitute fonts. But many people use the terms interchangeably.) Bespoke typefaces are an increasingly common corporate flex. Other companies that have recently commissioned them include Toyota, Duolingo, Southwest Airlines and CNN. Google has created several, from the minimalist Open Sans, to the playful YouTube Sans, to the ever-so asymmetric Scope One. Goldman intends to phase the font into its branding and marketing needs across its website, apps and even YouTube videos. “Corporate fonts provide a consumer’s first impression,” said Sarah Hyndman, the author of “Why Fonts Matter” and the owner of Type Tasting, which offers multisensory font workshops. ““It sets a tone. It creates trust. It’s a flavor.” To create its typeface, Goldman hired Dalton Maag, a stately 29-year-old British design firm that crafted Bookerly, used on Amazon’s Kindle e-readers, and the BBC’s BBC Reith, which is distinctly British, with subtle hints of calligraphy. Goldman’s brief was clear: The bank wanted something that was so legible you could read strings of numbers on a phone screen or a smartwatch but that would still look good on 50-foot billboards. To accomplish this, each character of Goldman Sans is sculpted to be identifiable at a glance. The tops of p, q, n and g all taper into what marketing materials call “slight chamfered spurs” to create more white space. The i and j, hard to differentiate in some fonts, feature unique crowns. The x-height (that is, the height of a lowercase x) is noticeably tall — more than three-quarters of the height of a capital letter. The interior shapes of rounded forms — o, b, d — differ from the external shapes to make them distinct. Perhaps most challengingly, Goldman Sachs wanted all numbers, from a skinny 1 to an obese 8, to line up perfectly in a financial table. Users can even apply italic, bold or light styling to letters and numbers without changing their alignment on spreadsheets. Some type obsessives were impressed. In Reddit’s main fonts forum, r/fonts, a user named “me3peeoh” called the feature “a gamechanger.” Goldman Sans had to be more than just practical. It had to have just the right amount of personality. “The design challenge was to make something distinctive enough to be worthy of existing without being so quirky that it got annoying over time,” said Andrew Williams, Goldman’s director of communications. The typeface gets funky in characters less likely to show up on a spreadsheet: The & and @ characters are almost obscenely curvy, and an alternate lowercase g is a wacky, double-story affair.
