Breonna Taylor and Kenneth Walker went out for a date on the evening of March 12, opting for dinner at a steakhouse. Ms. Taylor, who was employed at a hospital, had worked four back-to-back overnight shifts, so they decided to let off some steam. “It was a great day, and it was a normal day,” Mr. Walker said. The Louisville police raided Ms. Taylor’s home in the early hours of March 13. They were executing a warrant — the department linked her address to Jamarcus Glover, a convicted drug dealer with whom Ms. Taylor had romantic ties. At 12:40 a.m., the police began banging on her door and eventually rammed it down. The couple’s shouted pleas for those at the door to identify themselves, Mr. Walker said, went unanswered. Afraid and confused, he fired a single shot. The police discharged a hail of bullets into the apartment, killing Ms. Taylor. “So there’s just shooting, like we’re both on the ground,” Mr. Walker said of the raid. “I don’t know where these shots are coming from, and I’m scared.” As part of an investigation for The New York Times, our correspondent Rukmini Callimachi and the filmmaker Yoruba Richen spoke to neighbors and trawled through legal documents, police records and call logs to understand what happened that night and why. In the second and final part of the series, Rukmini talks about her findings. On today’s episode: Rukmini Callimachi, a correspondent for The New York Times. Background reading:
