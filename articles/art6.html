By Alan Feuer and Sean Piccoli Five people, including a 6-year-old boy and his mother, were shot early Monday at an unofficial celebration of J’Ouvert, a daybreak event in Brooklyn that typically marks the start of Carnival in Caribbean cultures, but was canceled this year because of the coronavirus. The gunfire erupted shortly before 3 a.m. at the crowded intersection of Nostrand Avenue and Crown Street in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, according to the police. The boy was shot in his left leg and taken to Kings County Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, the police said. The mother, 47, and three men — all adults — were also shot in either their feet or legs and were hospitalized. Investigators remained uncertain on Monday about how many shooters were involved. Terence A. Monahan, chief of detectives of the New York Police Department, said on Twitter on Monday morning that two men had been arrested in connection with the shootings and that two guns had been recovered. Chief Monahan added that the investigation was “in its early stages and is ongoing.” Video obtained by The New York Post shows scores of people marching through the streets, some playing musical instruments, when shots rang out. The video then shows people fleeing or taking cover behind lampposts. One person can be seen collapsing against a fence, presumably wounded, aided by the police and passers-by. J’Ouvert is traditionally held in the early morning hours before Brooklyn’s West Indian American Day Parade, a pageant of colorful Caribbean costumes and food that goes up and down Eastern Parkway. This year, however, both the pre-dawn festival and the parade itself were canceled because of safety measures banning groups of more than 50 people during the pandemic. The shootings came amid a citywide spike in gun violence that has concerned the police and City Hall officials and has been seized upon by President Trump as part of his law-and-disorder re-election campaign. In August, according to police statistics, shootings in New York more than doubled over the same period last year and murders rose by nearly 50 percent.
