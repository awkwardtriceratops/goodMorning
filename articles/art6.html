By Azi Paybarah and Christina Morales A standoff continued early Monday between the police and a man barricaded inside a house in Cedar Park, Texas, the police said, after three officers were shot and injured there the day before. After the gunfire, the man barricaded himself inside the house, in a suburb north of Austin, along with his mother and two other relatives, said Mike Harmon, the interim chief of the Cedar Park Police Department. Speaking to reporters near the house on Sunday evening, Chief Harmon pleaded for a nonviolent ending to the standoff. “We don’t want to see anybody else get hurt, but we do have a message for the suspect inside, and please take this to heart,” Mr. Harmon said. “We want to end this peacefully for everybody involved.” The three officers who were shot were treated at a nearby hospital, officials said. Mr. Harmon said that he had visited them and that “all are in stable condition and doing well.” A spokesman for the department said that as of 6 a.m. Monday, the standoff had not ended. On Twitter, the police urged neighbors to stay inside their homes. “It’s still unsafe to leave as we are working an active scene,” the department said. The episode began around 3 p.m. Sunday, when the police received a phone call from a woman who said her son, in his mid-20s, had kicked in the door of their home on Natalie Cove and was acting aggressively, Chief Harmon said. When officers arrived and entered the home, he said, “they were met with gunfire.”
