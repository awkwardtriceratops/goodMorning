Until a few years ago, when his cousin tried to kill him. On today’s Sunday Read, listen to Wil’s wide-ranging exploration of masculinity — that of his cousin’s as well as his own. “My attraction to my cousin and my detachment as a husband both reside in the pantheon of male tropes,” he wrote. “Masculinity is a religion. It’s a compendium of saints: the vaunted patriarch, the taciturn cowboy, the errant knight, the reluctant hero, the gentle giant and omniscient father.” This story was written by Wil S. Hylton.
