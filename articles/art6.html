By Megan Specia Law enforcement agents in Washington State killed a suspect on Thursday night in the shooting death of a right-wing activist in Portland, Ore., last week, the latest development in the protests and counterdemonstrations that have escalated tensions in the city and drawn the nation’s attention. The suspect, Michael Forest Reinoehl, 48, was shot by officers in Lacey, Wash., as they tried to arrest him, law enforcement officials said. The right-wing activist, Aaron J. Danielson, 39, had been shot five days earlier in Portland, and an arrest warrant for murder had been issued for Mr. Reinoehl earlier on Thursday. Mr. Reinoehl’s death is also playing out during a broader confrontation between opposing visions for the nation, as protesters demanding racial justice clash with right-wing activists on the streets in events that have become increasingly politicized ahead of the presidential election. Mr. Reinoehl was shot on Thursday night by officers from a federally led fugitive task force, the U.S. Marshals Service said.
