But Not Milwaukee’s.<br></h1><p id="artcont">The predominantly white neighborhoods outside Wisconsin’s largest city, among the nation’s most racially segregated suburbs, could be a key part of President Trump’s narrowing path to re-election. By Trip Gabriel CEDARBURG, Wis. — When Michael Hicks and his daughter chalked “Black Lives Matter” on the pavement outside their suburban home, someone scrubbed it away within hours. Then Mr. Hicks put up a Black Lives Matter sign on his cul-de-sac, only to find it tossed in a dumpster. He finally tried sticking signs in his garden, but a neighbor complained, and he removed them to avoid harassment. “They just seem to want to silence you in these suburbs,” said Mr. Hicks, who commutes from a condo in Grafton, Wis., to a Milwaukee school, where he teaches health and physical education. “They’re so happy in their comfortable bubble.” As many suburban Americans reject President Trump, threatening his re-election like no other bloc of voters, the suburbs outside Milwaukee, among the most racially segregated in the country, remain a bulwark of support. The well-educated, affluent counties north and west of the city have for decades delivered Republican landslides, defying a Democratic shift in suburbia in other Northern states. Voters such as Mr. Hicks’s neighbors seem to cleave to the president even more tightly as he has stoked fears of “anarchists” and “looters” imperiling the suburbs, including after the unrest in nearby Kenosha. Their enduring support is one reason Wisconsin offers Mr. Trump a still-open path to re-election, even as his opportunities in other battlegrounds have dwindled. For at least two decades, demographic changes in most American suburbs — an influx of nonwhite, well-educated and younger voters moving out of cities or immigrating from abroad — have pushed former Republican strongholds to become Democratic-trending regions. In Pennsylvania, the president is trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr. by double digits in the vote-rich suburbs of Philadelphia. In Michigan, the decisive swing to Democrats by suburbanites in Oakland County, outside Detroit, gives Mr. Biden a statewide edge. In Arizona, the Phoenix suburbs helped Democrats win a Senate seat in 2018 and are the knife edge on which the state is balanced. But around Wisconsin’s largest city, the suburbs’ prevailing whiteness tells a different story: In the region outside Milwaukee, including both inner suburbs and exurbs, Mr. Trump led Mr. Biden by 48 percent to 38 percent in a recent Marquette Law School Poll. “The WOW counties are key,” said Scott Walker, the former Republican governor of Wisconsin, using the nickname for the three Milwaukee suburban counties of Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington. Mr. Walker said in an interview that the president’s warnings, usually in lurid terms, of civil unrest that would ensue under a Democratic White House were working to solidify wavering suburban Republicans, who four years ago were lukewarm to Mr. Trump. He described a group of five couples that he and his wife, Tonette, have known since they were young parents in Wauwatosa, a Milwaukee suburb. Mr. Trump’s tone and personality repulsed the wives, he said, adding that his wife “would say to me, ‘He’s in trouble.’” But that is no longer the case. “A number have completely changed their minds since Kenosha,” Mr. Walker said. For their part, Wisconsin Democrats point to how they have cut into Republican margins in the suburbs in elections since 2016. They may not be persuading many Republicans to vote for Mr. Biden, but they are turning out supporters and volunteers who are new residents or were less active voters. Mr. Biden led in Wisconsin by five percentage points in a recent New York Times/Siena College Poll. By some measures, greater Milwaukee is the most racially segregated metropolitan region in the country. Waukesha County, the most populous of the three suburban counties, is 92.5 percent white and less than 2 percent Black, figures that have not budged in the last decade, according to the census. “If you had to find a part of the country that is an example of white flight, Milwaukee would be a poster child,” said Barry Burden, the director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. During the Great Migration, Black residents arrived later to the city than to Cleveland or Detroit, Dr. Burden said, and newly built interstate highways in the 1960s made it easier for higher-income white people to move out of the city and commute to work.
