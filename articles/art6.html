The New York Times Opinion section has been exploring how the United States can emerge from our current crises fairer and more resilient. One chapter of “The America We Need” series focused on the type of cities we need to live up to our nation’s founding ideals. Join us for a free virtual event at 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, Sept. 1, to hear from contributors to the series and other experts, and put your questions to them directly. Farhad Manjoo, a New York Times Opinion columnist, is hosting a conversation with Julián Castro, former secretary of housing and urban development and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate; Raj Chetty, professor of economics at Harvard University; and Sonja Trauss, a San Francisco Bay Area housing activist. They will discuss how cities can once again be engines of opportunity, places where Americans know they will find economic mobility. To do that, how will public education need to change? Should real estate developers’ plans for denser housing prevail over residents’ defense of the “character” of their neighborhoods? Can cities ever become less vulnerable to pandemics? You can R.S.V.P. for this event here.
