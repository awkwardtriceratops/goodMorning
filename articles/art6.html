Did It Work This Time?<br></h1><p id="artcont">The Trump team’s approach to the task of pigeonholing the challenger looked less focused than those used in 2004 and 2012. By Nate Cohn The last two presidential re-election campaigns followed a similar playbook: define the opposition early on the most important issue, emphasize a few cultural wedge issues to rally the base while appealing to a few swing voters, and reinvigorate supporters at the convention. It was enough for George W. Bush in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2012 to flip their approval ratings from negative to positive, and to win re-election. With that history in mind, this week’s Republican convention was one of the last, best opportunities for the president to revitalize his political standing. We’ll have to wait until mid-September — when polls stabilize after any convention bumps — before it’s clear whether Mr. Trump has succeeded like Mr. Obama or Mr. Bush. But judged against its predecessors, this year’s Republican National Convention differed from the traditional playbook in ways that raise doubts about whether Mr. Trump should be expected to make a breakthrough. The 2004 and 2012 re-election campaigns are probably best remembered for their success in defining the opposition. In each case, the convention offered a clear and simple answer to the question: “Who is the opponent?” And the answer reflected poorly on the ability of that opponent to address the central challenge facing the country. Mitt Romney was depicted as a rapacious plutocrat who personally embodied the policies that were eroding middle-class industrial jobs in the Midwest. John Kerry was depicted as a flip-flopper and a phony, who tried to have it every way on the Iraq war and whose indecision would threaten national security.
