By Zach Montague WASHINGTON — With just a week to go before the election on Nov. 3, the window is rapidly closing for many people who still plan to cast an absentee ballot through the mail. The Postal Service has reported that on-time delivery rates for first-class mail are far below its target throughout October, and a growing chorus of experts and election officials is warning voters in many parts of the country not to rely on the mail to cast their ballots, and instead to deliver ballots directly to election officials or collection points themselves. According to a news release on Friday, during the week of Oct. 10, the most recent for which data is available, the Postal Service saw on-time first-class mail delivery dip to 85.6 percent, near a low of 83 percent it reported during the summer peak of the pandemic in July. Normally, the agency reports on-time delivery, defined as within two days, at rates above 95 percent. Data compiled by The New York Times tracking on-time delivery rates reveals stubbornly persistent multiday delays throughout October, with key battleground states, including Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, all facing continuing troubles. “I would not mail in a ballot in this circumstance, and I think for anybody who can, either vote in person or drop it off at a box,” said Paul F. Steidler, a senior fellow who studies Postal Service operations and policies at the Lexington Institute, a research group. Anticipating pressure to get ballots to elections boards as fast and efficiently as possible, the Postal Service has put in place measures to sort out and expedite election-specific mail, which is often labeled and bar coded, making it easier to track and prioritize. According to data in court filings the agency provided during a lawsuit over operational changes that caused delays in September, the Postal Service stated that on-time delivery of election mail was as high as 97.2 percent at the time, even though overall on-time delivery for first-class mail was only 84.2 percent then. “It is being treated differently,” said Michael Plunkett, the president of the Association for Postal Commerce. “They’re doing things to identify it and isolate it in the network and devoting resources to make sure that the plants are cleared of election mail on a daily basis.” Kristin Seaver, the Postal Service’s chief retail and delivery officer, said the agency was “taking the steps necessary to devote extra resources to advancing ballot mail to increase the speed of delivery over all other mail.” “This will remain our No. 1 priority through the election,” she said. But experts have warned that not all ballots flowing back and forth from local election authorities and voters across disparate parts of the country are being identified, and that a significant portion is likely still being lumped in with first-class mail. Critics add that the lack of real-time data about where slowdowns may be worst also makes it impossible for voters to know how significantly the area they live in may be affected.
