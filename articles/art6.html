Parliament Swore Him In Anyway.<br></h1><p id="artcont">He may have been convicted of killing an opposition activist, but a member of Sri Lanka’s Parliament is keeping his day job. By Maria Abi-Habib A Sri Lankan politician sentenced to death on murder charges was sworn in as a member of the country’s Parliament on Tuesday, escorted out of prison to take his oath amid jeers from opposition legislators. The lawmaker, Premalal Jayasekara, was convicted in late July of opening fire on an election rally in 2015, killing an opposition activist. But the conviction and death sentence were handed down just days after Mr. Jayasekara had filed papers to run for re-election. Then his party swept to victory. The decision to allow Mr. Jayasekara to conduct his parliamentary duties as a member of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna party is the latest episode to unnerve opposition politicians and activists since Gotabaya Rajapaksa won the presidential election last November. The president is part of the Rajapaksa political dynasty, which is mired in scandal, accused of numerous human rights abuses and corruption charges when it ruled Sri Lanka from 2005 until 2015. The family has dismissed the accusations as false, and part of a political campaign to discredit them. During the family’s last stint in power, Mr. Rajapaksa served as defense secretary and his brother, Mahinda, was the president. Their government was accused of war crimes rising out of the final offensives against Tamil Tiger rebels, in which the United Nations estimates that as many as 40,000 civilians were killed. It was also accused of extrajudicial killings and the persecution of journalists, activists and political opponents. But to their supporters, the Rajapaksas are war heroes who defeated a ruthless insurgency and ended their country’s bloody civil war, which lasted 26 years. When Gotabaya Rajapaksa won the presidential elections last fall, he promptly appointed his brother as prime minister. On Tuesday, as Mr. Jayasekara walked on to the legislature’s floor for his swearing-in ceremony, opposition parliamentarians wore black shawls to mark the death for which he was convicted. “Shame!” they chanted. A member of the ruling party offered a different view. “Victory!” he declared. The opposition walked out of the chamber in protest as Mr. Jayasekara was sworn in. Addressing Parliament in a voice that shook with emotion, he said he had been framed and requested a new investigation and trial.
