By Remy Tumin and Sarah Hughes (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Wall Street is liking what it’s seeing. Stocks rallied to records, buoyed by the news that key states certified President-elect Joe Biden’s victory as well as his selection of Janet Yellen as the next Treasury secretary. The S&P 500 rose 1.6 percent, passing a high reached earlier in the month. The Dow Jones industrial average topped the 30,000 mark for the first time, another record. President Trump, who has consistently warned that markets would tumble if he lost re-election, took credit for the record. But investors of all political persuasions have said they’re ready to move on from a profitable but politicized period for the markets. 2. The transition to a Biden White House is officially underway. Teams for President-elect Joe Biden’s transition began reaching out across Washington, free to interact virtually with their counterparts in the government after President Trump’s administration finally cleared the way for an orderly transfer of power. That means Mr. Biden can finally dispatch what are known as landing teams to key public health agencies to begin his pandemic response. Members of his staff will get up to speed on a planned vaccine rollout and a public education campaign to persuade the public to trust — and take — a vaccine when one becomes available. Mr. Biden introduced six of the top officials he has selected to serve as part of his national security team, saying his cabinet picks are “ready to lead the world, not retreat from it.” 3. For now, the country appears to have avoided a breakdown of its electoral system. Next time, Americans might not be so lucky. Even in the absence of a questionable outcome or any evidence of fraud, President Trump managed to freeze the passage of power for most of a month. In attempting to subvert the election, Mr. Trump “exposed deep cracks in the edifice of American democracy and opened the way for future disruption and perhaps disaster,” our politics reporter writes in an analysis. We also talked to Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and former state House minority leader, about how Democrats managed to flip Georgia for the first time for the presidency since 1992. She outlined how liberal groups in other Southern states can replicate Georgia’s path. 4. A noncontroversial pardon from President Trump: the turkeys Corn and Cob.
