By James Poniewozik When the pandemic hit, the main problem for television productions was how you could possibly make shows in these times. The next and related problem was how you could possibly make shows about these times. Producers first tackled these related problems, technical and narrative, in special episodes like the “Parks and Recreation” and “30 Rock” reunions, as well as in one-off episodes of ongoing series, including the CBS legal drama “All Rise,” and in specials like HBO’s awkward “Coastal Elites.” The most notable thing about most of them is that they were done at all, but none of them had to sustain the approach for a full season. (An August Freeform four-episode series, “Love in the Time of Corona,” fell somewhere between the one-off special and the extended-series approach.) This month, two series test whether you can make compelling television in and about a deadly global crisis while it’s still going on, and — as viewers have been burrowing into the before-times normalcy of shows like “The Office” — whether anyone wants to see that right now. Both “Connecting…,” on NBC, and “Social Distance,” arriving Thursday on Netflix, are comedies. Maybe it makes sense: Just as “M*A*S*H” made dark comedy of the Korean War during the Vietnam War, the producers of these series must sense that asking people to escape a dire reality with more of that reality would be a tough sell without promising them at least theoretical laughs. Some are more theoretical than others. The well-meaning but bland “Connecting …” doesn’t feel like an organic, fleshed-out story so much as a pandemic season of an existing, generic friends-hanging-out sitcom whose previous seasons you haven’t seen. The comedy, from the “Blindspot” creator Martin Gero and his frequent collaborator Brendan Gall, centers on a group of friends in Los Angeles, now reduced to video chatting in between waiting for deliveries and doomscrolling the news. Many of the major friend-comedy food groups are represented, with a pandemic spin on each situation and neurosis. The high-strung Pradeep (Parvesh Cheena) is being driven stir-crazy by his young kids. Garret and Michelle (Keith Powell and Jill Knox) guiltily find that their marriage is thriving as the world falls apart. And possibly-more-than-friends Annie (Otmara Marrero) and Ben (Preacher Lawson) find their will-they-won’t-they flirtation stymied by the they-can’t reality of quarantine. The sitcom unfolds chronologically from the start of shelter-in-place orders. One of its pleasures is the attention to the details of those early days; we’ve spent enough time coping that pandemic nostalgia is actually a real, if unsettling, thing. Remember thermometer shortages? Remember making your own hand sanitizer? Remember sourdough? “Connecting …” intersperses its quar-hangout humor with heavier realities. Ellis (Shakina Nayfack) is transgender, has lost her job in the recession and worries about paying for hormone treatments. Jazmin (Cassie Beck), a doctor in New York, drops in to deliver the reality from the Covid front lines. It’s earnest, reasonably ambitious and lightly funny. But “Connecting …” lacks connection, its characters and dynamics too standard-issue to attach to. Too many of the quick-banter jokes feel as if they need a laugh track, and if you’re talking about 2020 in 2020, the kind of laughs that feel most believable come with a catch in the throat. That’s the mode of the more-effective “Social Distance,” an eight-episode anthology comedy created by Hilary Weisman Graham of “Orange Is the New Black” (whose creator, Jenji Kohan, serves as a producer). As on “Orange,” the comedy of “Social Distance” is sharp, provocative and cathartic, and more often than not, it’s rooted in pain. Though the episodes are short, some less than 20 minutes, watching them feels like entering the lives of full characters who have stories and conflicts that predate the pandemic and would be interesting even without it.
