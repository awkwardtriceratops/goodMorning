Here’s What to Do.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Any activity that can provide a sense of control or agency will feel like a balm in this moment. By Charlie Warzel Opinion writer at large Right now you probably feel like a spring that’s been tightly compressed under enormous weight. From the outside, it appears still. Inside it is coursing with intense potential (anxious!) energy just dying for release. All elections elicit this feeling to some degree. But the 2020 contest has raised the stakes, adding looming threats of disinformation and interference, contested results and a president who has repeatedly antagonized a deeply polarized electorate. It is an extremely stressful moment. The best description I’ve seen of our collective anxiety was from Mother Jones editor in chief Clara Jeffery: “The entire country is awaiting a biopsy result.” Why is waiting so difficult and what, if anything we can do to make this uncertain moment a little more tolerable? Waiting on news like election returns (or even just for Election Day to arrive) combines two unpleasant states: uncertainty and powerlessness. Each are deeply uncomfortable emotions. Put them together and it feels like torture. “For many people, they’ve voted and thus have taken what is perhaps the last action they can take to have an influence in the outcome,” Art Markman, a professor of psychology and marketing at the University of Texas at Austin, told me. “At that point you’re strapped into the roller coaster and it’s climbing up the hill and you can’t stop it.” The closer we get to an anticipated event, the more we have an emotional investment in it, and the more emotional investment, the more anxiety. Our brains begin to obsessively ruminate, chewing over our thoughts again and again, which becomes counterproductive. Often, Mr. Markman noted, we are deploying something called “defensive pessimism,” which is a strategy our brains use in stressful situations where we can control the outcome, like, say, a big exam. “It’s a great coping strategy when you have agency because being defensively pessimistic forces you to study more,” Mr. Markman said. But in circumstances out of our control, it is an example of the mind working against its best interests and creating more anxiety.
