It Didn’t Need to Be.<br></h1><p id="artcont">ON COLLEGE FOOTBALL Universities in the Pac-12 were clearly struggling financially even before the pandemic, which magnified the importance of football once it hit. By Billy Witz It was hard to remember as Michael Schill spoke on Thursday night that the school he runs as president, Nike U. (more formally known as the University of Oregon), has an athletic program that is all flash and sizzle: a glitzy basketball palace, slick mix-and-match football uniforms, and a glass study hall for athletes that is nicknamed the Jock Box. If there is a school in the Pac-12 Conference — and really the nation — that best personifies the runaway commercial enterprise that college sports have become over the last quarter century, it would be an otherwise unremarkable university that, thanks to the munificence of Nike founder Phil Knight, has emerged from a remote, rainy college town to become a national brand. But as Schill explained why the Pac-12 was making a hard pivot back toward football this fall, 45 days after saying in a 12-page document it was not safe to do so, he veered away from the science of the coronavirus pandemic to make an unprompted point. “This has nothing to do with money,” Schill said, scolding anyone who would suggest otherwise. As if to prove it, Schill said that in the conference presidents’ deliberations, the hundreds of millions in TV and advertising revenue that keep the college sports industrial complex churning never came up. Of course, the reason money didn’t come up is that it didn’t have to. It stood there like a big green elephant in the (virtual) room. U.C.L.A.’s athletic department was $18.9 million in the red last year, Stanford dropped 11 sports earlier this summer that were becoming too costly, and Washington State estimates its athletic department debt will be $99 million by next summer. And The San Jose Mercury News reported last month that the conference was laying the groundwork on a nearly $1 billion loan program if there was no football. How much television revenue will be distributed to the schools, whose 12-game schedule has been reduced to seven, has not yet been determined. But Jim Knowlton, the athletic director at California, said in an interview Friday that having football this fall could spare his department, which was looking at a $55 million shortfall with no fall sports, from having to take out a $20 million loan. “That would be great news for us since we’ve got debt service already,” said Knowlton, who added that salary cuts, operations reductions and other savings would account for the balance. When the Pac-12 punted on fall football on Aug. 11, it laid out three primary concerns: high infection rates in campus communities, health complications from the virus and a need for more frequent testing. The presence of rapid antigen tests, which can allow athletes to be tested daily, was viewed as a critical breakthrough. The tests are not as accurate as PCR tests, which must go to a lab for processing and can pick up tiny amounts of the virus. But if they are done daily, scientists believe they can be effective in keeping the virus from spreading. Still, the testing did not prod the Pac-12 back by itself. The conference secured an agreement on Sept. 3 with a manufacturer to provide daily tests for its football players by the end of the month, yet Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott did not contact state and local public health officials asking for exemptions that would allow teams to practice until the Big Ten announced last week that it would reverse course and play this fall.
