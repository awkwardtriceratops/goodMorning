By Adrian Matejka Chadwick Boseman embodied a James Baldwin’s dictum: “History is not the past. It is the present. We carry our history with us. We are our history.” Boseman carried our history insistently, imbuing titans of the real and imagined worlds with the best parts of himself. He recognized that they, too, make metaphors out of history even as it is being rewritten with every breath. He understood how exhausting it is to be made accountable minute by minute, how small almost all of us become inside that kind of accounting. What does it mean to be a cinematic citizen of the mind — cheekbones writ large, smiling like a big idea? There’s self-possession in that understanding, broad-shouldered chin to the sun. Restorer, re-historicizer of the Black backdrop in America and elsewhere. What about masculinity and isolation? What about the unrelenting gravity of community expectations and aspirations? Right in the nexus of need, trying to Mashed Potato between expression, obligation, light bills and wonder. How does history render the heavy load of itself unto itself? In lead roles, Boseman mostly played the outlier: the one with conviction, the one with enough crust and wherewithal to understand that everybody from the high steppers to the low downs is made of antiquity, sunlight and iron. What happens with that mix is the real alchemy, and he used it to re-dimension their largess and redefine their rough multitudes. The human capacity to harm other humans is as inexhaustible as gravity but not as inevitable. During the week I’m writing this, Jacob Blake was paralyzed when Kenosha, Wis., police officers shot him in the back seven times in front of his three children. And in the aftermath the W.N.B.A. and the N.B.A. and the M.L.S. and even the M.L.B. all refused to practice or play. And on the same day Jacob Blake was shot, Chadwick Boseman was dying from an illness that was nobody else’s business.
