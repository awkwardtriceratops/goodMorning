By Jill Cowan Good morning. The wildfires raging in Northern California have been blamed for seven deaths and the destruction of at least 1,200 buildings. As the state has learned over and again in years past, every death is devastating, and with every lost home or leveled neighborhood, people’s work and memories are incinerated. What’s different this year, officials and experts said on Monday, isn’t just that we are also grappling with a pandemic. It’s the staggering scale of the many fires sprawling across California. Gov. Gavin Newsom assured residents that “we’ve deployed every resource at our disposal” as the number of active fires grew to 625 across the vast state. [See the latest updates on the fires here.] And even though a new front of lightning storms was less severe than expected, Mr. Newsom emphasized that almost 300 lightning strikes had sparked 10 new fires — every one of which could have become a new threat. So far this year, more than 7,000 fires have chewed through 1.4 million acres, making this fire season one of the most active ever. For context, Mr. Newsom said, by this point in 2019, 4,292 fires had burned 56,000 acres across the state. Tens of thousands of firefighters from across California and from states as far away as Kansas have been enlisted to help contain the blazes and keep them from destroying homes and businesses. Hundreds of fire engines have been sent out across a huge swath of the state — including to towering forests that are being charred by fires “the likes of which haven’t been seen in modern recorded history,” Mr. Newsom said. But climate experts warned that the activity so early in the year and across such varied landscapes offers a preview of a fire and flood cycle that is likely to keep getting worse before it gets better. [The choking haze and the oppressive heat have become part of life in the Bay Area.] “I’m running out of superlatives,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at the University of California, Los Angeles. Mr. Swain said that he expected this year to see the greatest number of acres burned under California’s modern fire suppression regimen. More troubling, he said, is the fact that fires have burned ecosystems where there aren’t typically wildfires. Flames are common in expanses of dry grass and chaparral, particularly following a dry winter like the one this year. But burning Joshua trees, or redwoods and coniferous forests? That’s alarming. “I actually don’t know of any vegetation type that is not on fire in California,” Mr. Swain said. (This article is part of the California Today newsletter.

[Eater San Francisco] For the second week in a row, the governor’s Monday update on the state of the pandemic in California was encouraging. Over the past week, the state’s testing positivity rate was down to an average of 5.6 percent, Mr. Newsom said. According to The New York Times’s database, there was an average of 5,892 cases per day over the past week, a decrease of 21 percent from the average two weeks earlier.

And Mr. Newsom said he’d release new reopening guidelines this week. But the last time the state took significant steps to reopen indoor businesses, cases surged, prompting concerns that officials moved too quickly. And last month, the state reinstated restrictions. Mr. Newsom didn’t elaborate on what the new guidelines would look like, other than to say that officials and stakeholders were finishing them up after a weekend of discussions. The Republican National Convention kicked off on Monday, and there are set to be fewer California speakers than there were at the Democratic convention last week. (According to LAist, Representative Kevin McCarthy is the only elected official from the Golden State on the schedule.) There was, however, one clear California connection: Kimberly Guilfoyle, a top Trump fund-raiser and the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., gave a fervent speech painting a dark picture of California as a kind of dystopia. But she hasn’t always felt that way: Ms. Guilfoyle grew up in San Francisco and was once its first lady; she was married to our current governor, Mr. Newsom, while he was mayor. They were once described as “the new Kennedys.” The Washington Post published this extensive profile of Ms. Guilfoyle in 2018.

[The New York Times] David Valadao, the moderate Republican congressman who was narrowly ousted by a Democratic challenger in 2018, didn’t support President Trump in 2016. But he said he’ll vote for him this year. Mr. Valadao is running to reclaim his old seat. [The Fresno Bee] Both Duncan D. Hunter, the former San Diego-area congressman, and his wife were accused by federal authorities of misspending $250,000 in campaign funds. They reacted differently though: He denied wrongdoing and was sentenced to prison. She didn’t and was sentenced to home confinement. [The New York Times] Representative Katie Porter, a Democrat from Orange County, asked the postmaster general if he knew how much it cost to mail a postcard. He didn’t. [CNN] “She doesn’t know there is a fire. She doesn’t know there is Covid. So she just knew she was seeing her friends and was really happy to do so.” That’s according to SFGate, quoting Heidi Carmen about Kerith, her friendly golden retriever, a licensed therapy dog.
