Director Warns of Russian Interference and White Supremacist Violence<br></h1><p id="artcont">The testimony contradicted efforts by President Trump and other officials to downplay the threats. By Zolan Kanno-Youngs WASHINGTON — Christopher A. Wray, the director of the F.B.I., warned a House committee on Thursday that Russia is actively pursuing a disinformation campaign against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and expressed alarm about violent extremist groups. “Racially motivated violent extremism,” mostly from white supremacists, has made up a majority of domestic terrorism threats, Mr. Wray told the House Homeland Security Committee. He also echoed an intelligence community assessment last month that Russia is conducting a “very active” campaign to spread disinformation and interfere in the presidential election, with Mr. Biden as the primary target. “We certainly have seen very active — very active — efforts by the Russians to influence our election in 2020,” Mr. Wray said, specifically “to both sow divisiveness and discord, and I think the intelligence community has assessed this publicly, to primarily to denigrate Vice President Biden in what the Russians see as a kind of an anti-Russian establishment.” Mr. Wray’s blunt comments were the latest example of a top national security official contradicting President Trump’s downplaying of Russian election interference. A  homeland security official has accused the Trump administration of soft-pedaling both the Russian and white supremacist threats because they would make “the president look bad.” Mr. Wray’s testimony also came a day after another top administration appointee, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, undercut the president’s dim view of wearing protective masks and said that a coronavirus vaccine was most likely several months away. The president later lashed out at Dr. Redfield, saying he “made a mistake” on the vaccine timeline. The hearing was also notable for the absence of the acting secretary of homeland security, Chad F. Wolf, who was ordered to testify but skipped the appearance, defying a congressional subpoena. He instead met with the Senate Homeland Security Committee to prepare for his upcoming confirmation hearing, a department official said. Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting deputy secretary, criticized the committee on Twitter for not welcoming him in Mr. Wolf’s place. Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the chairman of the House committee, complained that Mr. Wolf should have shown up to answer questions on foreign efforts to interfere with the election, the coronavirus pandemic and the growing threat of domestic terrorism. “Mr. Wolf should be here to testify as secretaries of homeland security have done before,” Mr. Thompson said. “Instead we have an empty chair, an appropriate metaphor for the Trump administration’s dereliction on so many of these critical homeland security issues.” Mr. Wray was instead left to discuss the issues, along with Christopher Miller, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, who also testified. Mr. Wray condemned all acts of bloodshed but refrained from overemphasizing violence caused by far-left groups like Antifa, the loose movement that purports to be against fascism, which Mr. Trump and Attorney General William P. Barr have repeatedly blamed for unrest in American cities. Mr. Barr described Antifa this month as “the ramrod for the violence,” and the president’s re-election campaign has portrayed the group as a major threat to American cities. While some claiming affiliation to Antifa have committed violent acts, racist extremists have been the more lethal threat in recent years, Mr. Wray said. A former career prosecutor, Mr. Wray has attracted little attention as F.B.I. director, giving speeches focused on following rules and procedures. He has said he wants plowhorses, not showhorses, at the bureau.
