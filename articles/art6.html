It would be months until — after a Supreme Court decision — Mr. Bush would become the 43rd president of the United States. The confrontation held political lessons for both sides. Lessons that could be put to the test next week in an election likely to be shrouded in uncertainty: The pandemic, the volume of mail-in voters and questions around mail delivery could result in legal disputes.
