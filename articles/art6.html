By Remy Tumin and Karen Cetinkaya (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A debate like no other. The biggest threat to the election is the president himself, our national security correspondent writes in an analysis of last night’s showdown between President Trump and Joe Biden. Mr. Trump’s claim that balloting, already underway, was a “fraud and a shame” and proof of “a rigged election” amounted to a declaration that he would try to throw any outcome into courts, Congress or the streets if he were not re-elected. That assertion is part of an extensive Republican plan to disrupt the election by claiming that voter fraud is a pervasive problem, a five-month Times Magazine investigation found. Despite the rhetoric of administration officials and right-wing media, voter fraud is a largely nonexistent problem, and most claims of fraud have fallen apart under closer scrutiny. Here are the main takeaways from the report. 2. The Commission on Presidential Debates said it would change its format after Mr. Trump’s constant interruptions during his first face-off with Joe Biden. There will be new limits on speaking times, however, there is no decision yet on cutting off microphones. The commission said the chaotic and often incoherent event “made clear that additional structure should be added" for the remaining two debates. Here are six takeaways from last night’s event. Republicans distanced themselves from Mr. Trump over his failure to condemn white supremacy during the debate, as he faced a torrent of criticism. Members of the Proud Boys, a far-right group that has endorsed violence, were jubilant. 3. The debate left allies and rivals alike questioning the state of American democracy and the country’s place on the global stage. Our diplomatic correspondent looked at reactions around the world.
