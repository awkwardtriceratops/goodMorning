The Democrats mostly kept mum. By Lauren Kelley Ms. Kelley is a member of the editorial board. Ahead of her speech at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday evening, Abby Johnson, the former Planned Parenthood clinic director turned prominent anti-abortion activist, said she hoped to deliver “the most provocative, impassioned, memorable” anti-abortion speech in history. “It’s pretty graphic,” she said in a recent podcast interview teasing the speech. That it was. But before Ms. Johnson got to the gore, she started by outlining the plot of her 2010 memoir, “Unplanned,” which was turned into a feature film last year: Ms. Johnson gets a job at a clinic in Bryan, Texas, where she’s eventually encouraged to increase the number of abortions that are performed at the facility. But everything changes for her when one day she watches via ultrasound as a surgical abortion is performed. Reporters have raised questions about some of the central elements of this story. Among them: Ms. Johnson claims this abortion took place on a day when the Bryan clinic did not perform any surgical abortions, according to the clinic’s records. Elements of her story have changed over time — such as her purported knowledge of the documentation that some abortion clinics must submit to state regulators. (When confronted about such inconsistencies, she suggested that Planned Parenthood may have falsified documents.) And according to a former friend of Ms. Johnson’s, she left Planned Parenthood after being caught sending inappropriate emails — not because she witnessed an abortion that sparked her conversion. Nevertheless, Ms. Johnson, who now runs a group called And Then There Were None to encourage abortion clinic employees to leave their jobs, spoke on Tuesday evening of the “twirling” spine she saw on the ultrasound screen, as she watched it “succumbing to the force of the suction.” She said there was something her colleagues referred to as the “pieces of children” room at the clinic. “I know what abortion smells like,” Ms. Johnson said at one point. “Did you know abortion even had a smell?” The speech was as outrageous as one would expect of a woman who once said that the police would be “smart” to racially profile her biracial son and that American households should get one vote each — “In a Godly household, the husband would get the final say.” Like many R.N.C. speeches, Ms. Johnson’s address felt like it was being delivered from a different universe than the one where last week’s Democratic convention took place. That’s not because the Democrats delivered a full-throated endorsement of reproductive rights. Despite a party platform that’s become increasingly progressive on the issue, during the D.N.C. there were only a handful of references to abortion.
