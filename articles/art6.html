By Ken Belson Jason Wright, a former N.F.L. running back turned business consultant, has been named the new president of the Washington Football Team, the team announced on Monday. He is the first African-American to hold such a position in league history. At 38, Wright, who played seven seasons in the N.F.L. and has worked for the past seven years at McKinsey & Company, the international consulting firm, is also the youngest team president in the league. As a consultant, he has helped reshape government agencies, industrial companies and institutions of higher learning. Wright has no experience working at an N.F.L. team, though he was his team’s union representative for two years heading into the lockout in 2011. While responsibilities can vary from team to team, club presidents typically oversee all business operations and sometimes look after the football side of the franchise, and report directly to the owner. Wright will be in charge of the team’s operations, finance, sales and marketing divisions, among others. “This organization is going through wholesale transformation on multiple fronts,” Wright said in a phone interview. “This is going to be a very challenging but exciting time.” The Fritz Pollard Alliance, which has pressed the league for years to increase the diversity of its executives and coaches, said it hoped Wright’s hiring was the start of a trend.
