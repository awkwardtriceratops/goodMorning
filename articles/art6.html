Will Close Schools and Businesses in Hard-Hit Areas<br></h1><p id="artcont">“Today, unfortunately, is not a day for celebration,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said. His plan would affect nine neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens. TRANSCRIPT I’m going to be giving an update that gives me no joy at all. In fact, it pains me to be putting forward this approach that we’ll need. But in some parts of our city, in Brooklyn and Queens, we’re having an extraordinary problem, something we haven’t seen since the spring. And we have to address this issue forthrightly. That’s why we’re here on a Sunday after several days of continuing to review all the data, look at everything from the point of view that has gotten us this far as a city, always relying on the data and the science. What has become clear is that there are a number of neighborhoods now that have continued to have a high level of coronavirus positivity and that requires stronger action than we’ve had to take for many months. So the plan is to rewind in these nine zip codes. To rewind, to go back, to address the problem by using the tools that we know work, which is to ensure that non-essential businesses are not open and a variety of activities are not happening. Again, no joy in saying that. But that, unfortunately, we do know is what is necessary to stop the spread of the coronavirus. By Dana Rubinstein, Daniel E. Slotnik and Eliza Shapiro Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Sunday that he intended to “rewind” the reopening in nine neighborhoods in New York City that have had a testing positivity rate of more than 3 percent over the last seven days. That means the closure of nonessential businesses, public and private schools and day care centers in those neighborhoods, which are in Brooklyn and Queens. Many of them have large populations of Orthodox Jews, and the virus has been spreading rapidly in those communities in recent weeks. The mayor said he would also put lesser restrictions on 11 other neighborhoods where the rates are rising. In total, the mayor’s plan would affect only 20 of the 146 ZIP codes in the city. Still, the move reflects the growing fear of a second wave of the virus, and marks the first major reversal in the city’s reopening since it was hit hard by the outbreak in March. If approved by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the plan would go into effect on Wednesday. “Today, unfortunately, is not a day for celebration,” Mr. de Blasio said. “Today is a more difficult day.” The nine ZIP codes subject to the most severe restrictions include portions of Far Rockaway and Kew Gardens in Queens, and Borough Park, Midwood, Gravesend, Bensonhurst and Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn. The restrictions would be in place in these neighborhoods for two to four weeks, if not longer, depending on the success of efforts to curb the virus, the mayor said. The city is also closely watching the 11 additional ZIP codes, which Mr. de Blasio described as a “real concern.” They include parts of Williamsburg, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Manhattan Beach, Bergen Beach, Kensington and Crown Heights in Brooklyn. The Queens neighborhoods include Rego Park, Fresh Meadows, Hillcrest and Jamaica Estates. In those neighborhoods, the city will curtail indoor dining, which has only just begun, and close gyms and pools. Most of the schools set to close are nonpublic schools, largely yeshivas in Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods that have been open for weeks. About 200 private schools will close, and 100 public schools, officials said.
