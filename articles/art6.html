By Kenneth P. Vogel WASHINGTON — Elliott Broidy already had a record when he became a major fund-raiser for the Trump campaign in 2016. Now he has become the latest Trump ally to face criminal charges, this time accused of evading foreign lobbying laws while trying to make money off his access to the administration. Mr. Broidy was charged with a single count of conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act as part of an influence operation that prosecutors say sought to use his political ties to help Malaysian and Chinese interests, according to federal court filings that became public on Thursday. The case centers on an accusation that Mr. Broidy accepted $6 million from an unnamed foreign client to lobby administration officials to end a federal investigation related to the looting of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund, known as 1MDB. The court filing also accuses Mr. Broidy of seeking the extradition of a Chinese citizen from the United States. He did not succeed in either effort. While the foreign client was not identified, people familiar with the case said he was the Malaysian financier Jho Low, who the federal authorities say played a key role in the theft of billions of dollars from 1MDB. Mr. Broidy, 63, is expected to enter a guilty plea to the charge, which was filed last week by prosecutors from the Justice Department’s Public Integrity section and its election crimes branch and unsealed this week. Mr. Broidy’s representatives declined to comment. The charge against him was detailed in a criminal information, which is often filed in cases in which a guilty plea has been entered or agreed to. The details of the accusations against Mr. Broidy are especially striking: They include a promised $75 million “success fee” from Mr. Low and discussions about arranging for Malaysia’s prime minister to play golf with President Trump. But they follow a pattern that has become familiar since Mr. Trump began seeking the White House. People who had backgrounds or were pursuing business that was likely to have raised red flags in other campaigns and administrations marketed themselves as intermediaries to individuals, companies and countries wanting something from the Trump administration. They were able to do so because Mr. Trump ran for office and came to Washington without the established networks of gatekeepers, lobbyists and fund-raisers that typically surround a president. Many of Mr. Trump’s close associates have been charged in the nearly four years since he was elected. Among those who have pleaded or were found guilty of charges related to their work for him are Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser whose case the Justice Department is now seeking to dismiss; George Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser; and Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime friend whose sentence the president commuted. Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his deputy, Rick Gates, were charged with lobbying and financial crimes that predated their work for the president’s campaign. The two pleaded guilty to lesser charges in exchange for agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors, as did Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s longtime personal lawyer. Mr. Cohen, Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort had sought to parlay their perceived access to the president into business opportunities. But few figures seized on the Trump presidency more ambitiously than Mr. Broidy, who owns a defense contracting firm. He had been a top Republican fund-raiser for years, but he had retreated from politics after pleading guilty in 2009 to a charge, later reduced to a misdemeanor, in an unrelated pension fund bribery case. After Mr. Trump emerged as the Republican presidential nominee in 2016, Mr. Broidy threw his support behind him at a time when most elite Republican donors were staying away. And when Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Broidy became a leading fund-raiser for Mr. Trump’s inauguration and the Republican National Committee, as well as a member of Mar-a-Lago, the president’s private resort in Florida. Mr. Broidy enlisted Mr. Cohen to arrange a payout to a former Playboy model who became pregnant during an affair and paid Mr. Gates to help pursue a contract for his defense firm and administration appointments for his associates. And Mr. Broidy began aggressively promoting his connection to the new administration to politicians, business executives and governments around the world. His defense company won big contracts from the United Arab Emirates and Angola. And Mr. Broidy offered a trip to Mar-a-Lago to an Angolan politician from whom he was seeking to collect additional payments. But the charge against Mr. Broidy is not related to his defense company or its clients. Rather, it stems from his arrangement with Mr. Jho, a flamboyant Malaysian financier who federal authorities have said played a key role in the looting of 1MDB, and who is said to have subsequently spent on extravagances like paintings by Pablo Picasso and Claude Monet and the financing of the Hollywood film “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Mr. Low, who is believed to be living in China, was charged in the United States in 2018 in connection with the 1MDB theft, but he has not appeared in criminal court in the United States or Malaysia, where he was also charged. The filing said that Mr. Broidy and a pair of associates agreed in 2017 to work for Mr. Low “to orchestrate back-channel, unregistered campaigns to lobby the administration,” including the Justice Department, to “end the 1MDB matters” and to remove a Chinese citizen from the United States “and send him back to” China. The Chinese citizen is not identified by name in the filing, but he is known to be the billionaire dissident Guo Wengui, an outspoken critic of China who has been charged by its government with corruption and is seeking asylum in the United States. Some of Mr. Broidy’s associates involved in the arrangement have already been charged, including Nickie Lum Davis, a political fund-raiser who pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Another person involved in the effort, George Higginbotham, a former Justice Department employee, pleaded guilty in 2018 to conspiring to lie to banks about the source of tens of millions of dollars he funneled into the United States from Mr. Low. In his guilty plea, Mr. Higginbotham admitted that he and the entertainer and businessman Pras Michel, a former member of the Fugees, a defunct hip-hop group, arranged for millions of dollars of Mr. Low’s money to be transferred to a law firm owned by Mr. Broidy’s wife to pay them to try to end the 1MDB investigation. Prosecutors said in the filing that Mr. Michel received $8.5 million from Mr. Low, while Mr. Broidy was paid $6 million and Ms. Davis $1.7 million in 2017. The prosecutors cited a contract with Mr. Broidy’s wife’s law firm stipulating that if the Justice Department dropped its civil forfeiture proceedings against Mr. Low within 180 days, Mr. Low would pay a $75 million success fee, or $50 million if the matter was resolved within 365 days. As part of the effort, prosecutors say Mr. Broidy asked Mr. Trump in June 2017 “if he would play golf” with Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia. Mr. Najib is not identified by name in the charging document, but he was in office at the time and was planning a trip to Washington, despite being under investigation by federal prosecutors for his role in the 1MDB theft. Mr. Broidy and Ms. Davis believed that a golf game with Mr. Trump “would please” Mr. Najib and allow him “to attempt to resolve the matter” of the 1MDB investigation, according to the filing. It added that Mr. Broidy “also hoped to secure additional business with the government” of Malaysia. Mr. Najib did meet with Mr. Trump in September 2017, but he was denied the customary photograph in the Oval Office with the president, let alone the golf outing, despite Mr. Broidy’s repeated lobbying of Mr. Trump’s aides. Mr. Najib was later convicted in Malaysia of corruption charges related to the 1MDB theft. The Justice Department did not drop its investigation of 1MDB, charging Mr. Low with money laundering in 2018. He agreed last year as part of a civil forfeiture case to give up his claim to hundreds of millions of dollars in luxury apartments, yachts, jets and artwork that prosecutors said were bought with stolen money. Prosecutors also claim that Mr. Broidy and his associates traveled to Thailand, Malaysia and China to meet with Mr. Low, a Chinese government official and others “to negotiate and discuss the arrangement by which Broidy would lobby the administration and D.O.J. — outside of official channels — in exchange for millions of dollars.” Mr. Broidy drafted a memo to Attorney General Jeff Sessions in 2017 about the possibility of extraditing Mr. Guo, writing that “while conducting business in Malaysia” he had learned of “a potential opportunity for the U.S. and China to increase their law enforcement cooperation” with the extradition. A person close to Mr. Broidy said he never sent that memo, and a Justice Department spokeswoman said Mr. Sessions never received it. Mr. Guo remains in the United States. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
