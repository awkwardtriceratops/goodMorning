She told Andrew, who is Asian-American, that his “race might be an issue.” Andrew was shocked. The kicker? Sarah is also Asian-American. Today, we hear both sides of this story — and find out where Sarah and Andrew are now. Andrew Lee’s first message to his wife, Sarah Chen. The two matched on a dating app after Sarah’s friend convinced her to “check the box” in her filter that allowed Asian men to be included. Andrew Lee’s first message to his wife, Sarah Chen. The two matched on a dating app after Sarah’s friend convinced her to “check the box” in her filter that allowed Asian men to be included. Sarah grew up in Texas, loving country music. Both she and Andrew had “learned to square-dance in cowboy boots,” Andrew wrote in his essay. Andrew grew up in Colorado. He and his family would often go camping and visit national parks. Despite having similarities in their “all-American upbringings,” Andrew and Sarah grew up with different perspectives toward their Asian heritage. The couple got engaged in North Beach, one of the neighborhoods they visited on their first date. They’ve been married since 2019.  “I felt a hot shame,” Jerico wrote in her Tiny Love Story, about her reaction to first learning the term “manic pixie dream girl.” “I loved someone who needed me to stay that way.
