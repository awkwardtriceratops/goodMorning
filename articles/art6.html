Only 155 people have achieved the honor since the 1997 founding of the Americas chapter of the Court of Master Sommeliers, the examining body that confers the title on those who survive its grueling, yearslong qualification process. Of those, 131 are men. The court and its separate educational spinoff, GuildSomm, have seen a flood of new candidates since 2012, when the documentary “Somm” chronicled the intensive training process for the final exam. More than 12,000 people are now members of the community, many of them young women hoping to avoid the sexist hazing that is notorious in the wine industry by joining the court’s program of mentorship and education. What they have encountered is very different. Twenty-one women told The New York Times that they have been sexually harassed, manipulated or assaulted by male master sommeliers. They, and other current and former members of the court, say the abuse is a continuing problem of which its leadership has long been aware. One master sommelier, according to these accounts, propositioned at least 15 candidates, sometimes promising professional favors in return for sex. Another shut the door to a classroom full of students in the face of a woman who had refused his advances. One student said a master sommelier in Texas asked her for a pair of her underwear “to snuggle with.” Several said the slur “sommsucker” is used for women who have relationships with members of the court. And one woman said she was raped by a prominent master sommelier in New York City after meeting him at a wine event. “Sexual aggression is a constant for women somms. We can’t escape it, so we learn to live with it,” said Madeleine Thompson, 28, a wine director in Dallas who said she opted out of the court’s qualification process because of harassment by several master sommeliers. “It’s a compromise we shouldn’t have to make.” In a written response to questions from The Times, the court said it expected members “to uphold the highest standards of professional conduct and integrity at all times.” It has “investigated every accusation of such conduct that has been brought to their attention,” and imposed multiple disciplinary sanctions. Last month, the group established a hotline for anonymous reporting of ethical violations, including sexual misconduct. Previously, there was no mechanism for doing so other than a direct approach to the board — a body that has often included the men accused. The Court of Master Sommeliers, Americas, a nonprofit headquartered in Napa, Calif., is part of an international network of affiliated courts, all swathed in pomp and privilege. Master sommeliers show up tableside at top restaurants; they act as paid ambassadors for global brands like Krug and Moët Hennessy, consultants for top hotel chains, guides on luxury cruises and senior executives at the biggest wine distributors. Earning the red-and-gold lapel pin that denotes a master sommelier brings a lifelong payoff. Working their way up through four levels, from introductory to master sommelier, candidates pay for classes, tastings and testing — but then command high fees. In an internal 2017 survey, master sommeliers reported a median annual income of $164,000 and a median consulting rate of $1,000 per day. Grading of the final test is cloaked in secrecy, determined by examiners drawn from the senior ranks of master sommeliers. Letters of recommendation, access to expensive wines for tasting practice and educational trips to wine regions are also needed to pass — and are all in the hands of these senior masters, who are, overwhelmingly, older white men. This dynamic has turned a system that should provide mentorship and equal opportunity to women into a bastion of sexual harassment and coercion. “Among certain men, there’s no attempt to hide it and no shame in it,” said Jonathan Ross, 37, who has been a master sommelier since 2017. “It’s like something from another era.” Geoff Kruth, 45, has long been one of the court’s leading educators — the founder and president of GuildSomm, a former board member, and featured as an authority in “Somm” and its sequels. Eleven women told The Times they had experienced sexual misconduct by Mr. Kruth; through a lawyer, he denied any impropriety. Last week, he resigned his position at GuildSomm “to remove the Guild from any controversy.” Jane Lopes, 35, a wine importer in New York, said Mr. Kruth suddenly slid his fingers inside her underpants and kissed her breast as they said good night after a 2013 dinner. Courtney Schiessl, 30, said that when she assisted Mr. Kruth at a 2013 event in Chicago, he asked her out for cocktails afterward, inquired which of the bartenders she would choose for sex, then insisted that the taxi driver skip her hotel and take them both to his — where she rejected his advances. Christina Chilcoat, 35, a sommelier in Jacksonville, Fla., said that in 2015 Mr. Kruth opened the door to his New Orleans hotel room naked, having invited her and a friend to taste some “special bottles” after his master class on Champagne. That same year, Rachel van Til had a job as wine director at Mabel Gray restaurant near Detroit, and a dream of putting Michigan wines on the world map. She was flattered when Mr. Kruth contacted her online to offer help with her work. “I was living in a tertiary market at best, I knew nobody, and I was happy to friend anybody who could help me,” said Ms. van Til, 30. After months of chatty, work-related Facebook exchanges, some of which she shared with The Times, Mr. Kruth sent her a link to a graphic oral-sex guide, and asked which position was her favorite. She submitted a formal complaint to the court’s board, which granted her request to bar Mr. Kruth from judging her future exams. Rania Zayyat, 33, met Mr. Kruth at a class he taught in Houston in 2015. Soon after, she said, he messaged her on Facebook about a selfie she had posted, commenting on her beautiful eyes, and repeatedly urged her to meet him at a Florida tasting competition that he was judging. She asked some female colleagues about Mr. Kruth, and was stunned to hear many similar stories. When she later earned a spot on a tasting trip to Germany, she said others asked: “‘How did you get on this trip? Did Geoff get you on this trip?’” “It was heartbreaking and insulting,” said Ms. Zayyat, who went on to found the organization Wonder Women of Wine. “I thought, is this going to be my entire career?” Ivy Anderson, a sommelier in Charleston, S.C., was 22 and had just taken Mr. Kruth’s Champagne class when he contacted her, saying he noticed that she had bought a ticket to GuildSomm’s 2016 holiday party in New York. He invited her to a dinner at a glamorous restaurant, Piora, the workplace of one of her heroes: Victoria James, the restaurant’s wine director and — as the youngest person to become a certified sommelier, at age 21 — a celebrity to young candidates. He also invited her, she said, to stay in a Manhattan hotel with him and other court members. Thrilled to be singled out, she accepted, assuming she would be crashing on a sofa somewhere. But at the hotel, Ms. Anderson was taken aback to find only one room, with one bed. On the way to dinner, she said, Mr. Kruth told her that he and his wife had an open relationship, that he had had a “passionate” affair with Ms. James, and that sex between master sommeliers and candidates was common. (The court's nonfraternization policy doesn’t prohibit that, as long as it’s disclosed to the board and doesn’t appear to pose conflicts of interest.) “I can’t reject this person,” she remembered thinking. “It’s freezing cold, I know no one in New York, and he’s going to throw me out in the street.” Back in his hotel room, she said, she felt that going along when he initiated sex was her only option. Ms. Anderson said she went home shaken and disgusted, but convinced that she had done what was expected of women in her profession. “I guess this is how you get to be the next Victoria James,” she thought. Ms. James, 29, now a partner and beverage director at Cote, in Manhattan, said she believed the same thing about her role models when she was working her way up. “It breaks my heart that Ivy believed it," she said. In 2014, Ms. James won a place on a tasting trip to Switzerland led by Mr. Kruth. She had been warned not to be alone with him, she said, but he seemed respectful during pretrip text exchanges. On the trip, she said, he repeatedly angled to get her away from the group and into her hotel room. Eventually, they had sex. “I thought it would appease him and he would go away,” she said. She was angry, she said, but not surprised. “The sad thing is that you get used to being beholden to men in this industry,” Ms. James said. “I felt like I didn’t have a choice.” About a year later, she said, Mr. Kruth offered to write a recommendation letter she needed to proceed to the next exam if she would meet him for sex at a court event in Austin, Texas. She did. “I got off the waiting list the next day,” she said. “I felt dirty and terrible, and that was the end of the court for me.”
