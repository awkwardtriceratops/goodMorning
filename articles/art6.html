By Charles M. Blow Opinion Columnist If you are having a hard time fathoming how Donald Trump could deny reality, attempt to force-feed America his fictions, fight truth with conspiracy and concoction, and try to spin a loss into a victory, you shouldn’t. You need only be open to a fair analysis of Trump’s life. There is nothing new about this man’s behavior. This is what he has always been: a liar, a con man and a grifter. For instance, consider a period in his life 30 years ago, in 1990, and you will see that everything he is doing now he did then. His brazen play at fact alteration isn’t innovation but regurgitation.

He tore off her clothes and unzipped his pants. “‘Then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than sixteen months. Ivana is terrified … It is a violent assault,’ Hurt writes.” Ivana Trump has strenuously objected to this interpretation of events. At the same time, Donald Trump’s casino business was floundering.
