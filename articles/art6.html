Can I Kick Him Out?<br></h1><p id="artcont">THE ETHICIST By Kwame Anthony Appiah I am a research dean and professor, and I’ve been working from home during the pandemic. I anticipate this will continue for the entire academic year. My husband retired on disability many years ago. Last December, our 30-something son lost his job and asked if he could move in with us, and how long he could stay. I told him that depended on how good of a roommate he was. The answer? Terrible. He is moody and volatile. I live on edge because I never know when he is going to blow up. He kicked a hole in a solid wood door. He has called me many derogatory names, told me I was ugly and stupid. If I don’t remember something, he accuses me of lying. I bear the brunt of our son’s behavior because my husband is mostly in bed. When my son is in a good mood, he is OK, but I never know what to expect. He was supposed to be working on a website to support himself. My understanding was that his staying with us was temporary. I would like him to move out. Although he complains bitterly about how horrible it is living with us, when we asked him to move, he refused. We live in a city where tenancy laws mean we would have to legally evict him. He thinks he can’t be evicted because he has been here for more than 30 days, but he doesn’t pay rent or utilities and has no lease. (He did not grow up here. We moved here a few years ago and live in an apartment that wasn’t intended for three adults.) I offered to sign him up for health insurance and pay for it, but he refused. I am paying for his car because I co-signed the loan, so I can’t afford a separate apartment for him. We strongly suspect he has mental-health issues, but he considers his problems external and won’t see a therapist — that it’s all mumbo jumbo. Given his mental state, is it unethical to evict him? I feel like I’m in an abusive relationship and desperately want him out. I realize that if we evict him, it may be the end of our relationship with him, but much of the time that feels preferable (and saner) to me than what I am living with. Name Withheld I’m so sorry to hear about the difficulties you are facing with your son. The pandemic, naturally, makes situations like yours worse; it has become harder to seek relief from domestic pressures in other areas of our social lives. But you should be clear on one point: You do not owe it to anyone, including your own adult children, to let them make a habit of abusing you, whether physically or verbally. Allowing such abuse out of a sense of obligation is a moral mistake. And it may be a mistake in other respects too: Once someone feels he has you under his thumb, he has no incentive to change his behavior. Of course, if people have a serious mental illness, it can be inappropriate to hold them fully responsible for everything they do. But even they can be capable of responding, to some degree, to the anger and resentment (and, conversely, the pleasure and gratitude) that their behavior produces. Very few people are incapable of controlling some of their behavior if the incentives are right. Abandoning all blame amounts, in the end, to ceasing to treat a person as a moral agent at all. If your son believed that you would find a way to kick him out if he went on misbehaving, then he’d feel more pressure to restrain himself from lashing out at you. But I don’t see that you have given him much reason to believe this. You’ve already allowed him to refuse to leave. You evidently have not asked him to give up the car. (You bring up the car payments only to explain why you can’t afford to pay for housing elsewhere.) You have, in short, continued to repay his appalling behavior with great generosity. A painful twist is that his anger might be fueled in part by that generosity: He may experience his dependence on you, at an age when people are supposed to be set up on their own, as humiliating. Then there’s the matter of psychiatric assistance. People who need treatment sometimes don’t recognize that fact, but this can make them impossible to help. Psychiatrists often distinguish between mood disorders and personality disorders, the latter of which are said to be more stable and medication-resistant. (There are various drugs for bipolar disorder; the F.D.A. has approved no drug specifically for borderline personality disorder.) Whatever the nature of his psychological difficulties, though, the advice of a mental-health professional could be helpful; the trouble is that even a professional would have a hard time knowing what to advise without meeting him. You could make such a consultation a condition of his staying with you. But it seems he has already decided that you won’t really toss him out. Could someone mediate a conversation with the three of you? True, getting to the point of accepting mediation would require negotiations you may not want to face. But if you can, you might want to give it a try. Otherwise, you could consult a lawyer to see what your legal options are. If you get serious about demanding that he moves out, you may need to have someone other than your disabled husband around in order to protect you in case your son turns violent, which I’d think he is less likely to do in front of a witness. You live in an apartment building: If there are doormen, you can ask the building not to admit him without your permission. And you can tell him that you’re willing to discuss, by phone or email, what forms of help you will offer him in the future, provided he conducts himself with some measure of civility. You may feel that you invited this hell upon yourself. But you don’t deserve it, and you shouldn’t accept it. While under the influence of alcohol at a party, a senior emergency-medicine resident repeatedly stated that he was unhappy with his career and wished to end it all. He was cheerfully uninhibited, then proceeded to profess high hopes for his next clinical attachment to another hospital. The next day, I was texted by a senior colleague who was present at the gathering to assess the resident’s risk of harming himself. Another attending, who is the resident’s supervisor and confidante, told me that there was nothing to worry about — that I should “forget about it, as it is the alcohol talking.” Given that I organized the gathering where the resident declared his life a disappointment, I texted him with a nonthreatening general message: “Thanks for sterling attendance. You and the rest were great fun. Stay sane and safe.” (The last sentence refers to the coalface of delivering care during the Covid pandemic.) I am not sure about calling the resident to talk about his intoxicated declarations, because he has yet to respond to my text. The resident’s supervisors and confidantes believe that he is not at risk, but I know that doctors are more vulnerable to a completed suicide. They tell me that they will not perform a welfare check because his declaring his unhappiness publicly means he is not hiding a serious intention of killing himself. The resident’s optimism about starting a new job suggests he plans to weather the storm. How should I proceed? Name Withheld, Australia In Australia, where you live, suicide is the leading cause of death among people between 15 and 44. Your colleague’s remarks may or may not have been a worrisome sign, but technically they’d indicate “suicidal ideation,” which, no surprise, is a risk factor for suicide. The National Institute of Mental Health (N.I.M.H.) guidelines here in the United States suggest that you should ask people you have concerns about whether they’re thinking of killing themselves. (Raising the issue with someone doesn’t seem to increase the probability that they’ll do it.) So you could have been less tactful in your message, and you might want to say to him, perhaps better in person than in an email: “You mentioned suicide when we were talking last night. Is that something you’re really thinking about?” Listening sympathetically to someone’s troubles seems to help — that’s high on the N.I.M.H. list, too. So is making sure that the person has access to a suicide-prevention help line. All this could prove an overreaction, but it also amounts to a simple gesture of human solidarity — an expression of caring and concern. And, whether or not your colleague is at risk for suicide, that seldom goes wrong. If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
