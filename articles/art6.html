By Michael Wear Mr. Wear, who served in the White House as part of President Barack Obama’s faith-based initiative, is a senior adviser to Not Our Faith PAC. Joe Biden succeeded in his mission to end Donald Trump’s presidency, and he did so, in part, because of the wise, persistent and strategic way his campaign related to faith. This was not inevitable. Mr. Trump’s re-election effort, like his campaign in 2016, relied on his ability to appeal to Christian voters directly, without robust competition. While Hillary Clinton certainly won among some religious communities, including people of faith who are racial or religious minorities, Democrats did not do nearly enough in 2016 to contest Mr. Trump’s explicit appeals to Christians of all backgrounds, who still comprise over two-thirds of the electorate. In 2016, Mrs. Clinton lost support among more religious demographics compared with 2012. In 2020, Joe Biden and his campaign insisted that would not happen again. Christians, and others, responded and made an essential contribution to Mr. Biden’s winning coalition. While exit poll data will continue to adjust as the final votes are tallied, we already know that Mr. Biden’s outreach has been vindicated. Nationally, he won 23 percent of white evangelicals, closing the gap from 2016 by 11 percentage points (from 64 to 53). This amounts to a swing of well over four million votes nationally, which accounts for much of Mr. Biden’s lead in the popular vote. While there has been significant discussion of Mr. Trump’s gains among Black and especially Hispanic voters, Mr. Biden more than made up for those losses with his increased share of white evangelical support. This shows up in key battleground states that decided the election. In Michigan, Mr. Biden won 29 percent of white evangelical support while Mrs. Clinton won 14 percent in 2016, an improvement that accounts for more than a 300,000 vote swing. In Georgia, Mr. Biden leads, in part, because he almost tripled Mrs. Clinton’s showing among white evangelicals, winning 14 percent compared to 5 percent. Many different communities contributed to Mr. Biden’s victory; that’s why it’s called a coalition. But this is the point: Christians and other religious voters make up much of the Democrats’ base. Faith outreach is not only about reaching rural white conservatives but people of faith who are from communities that are more likely, but not certain, to vote Democratic. Mr. Biden, a committed Irish Catholic who ran in large part because he believed he could win in the Great Lakes states Mrs. Clinton lost, proved his case by winning Catholics nationally — an eight-point, three-million vote swing from 2016, in the preliminary accounting — and keeping the margin among white Catholics close enough to win in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Arizona and Michigan. He also looks to have improved among mainline Protestants as well. We expect to learn more in the coming days about how different religious groups voted, but what is clear now is that Mr. Biden built a broad, multiethnic, multiracial, multireligious coalition that carried him to victory. From the beginning, Mr. Biden ran a campaign that directly appealed to religious voters. His mantra of “restoring the soul of America” harks back directly to the stated goal of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (“Redeeming the Soul of America”), one of the most striking examples of a confident Christian witness in the last century of American civic life. Mr. Biden’s campaign advertised aggressively and directly to religious voters and his general campaign ads also regularly featured faith messages and people of faith. This focus on faith wasn’t kept to targeted slices of the electorate, but was made an integral part of the most far-reaching, high-stakes moments of the campaign, including the first hour of the final day of the Democratic convention. That night, Sister Simone Campbell delivered an invocation. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, Mr. Biden’s close friend and a national co-chair of his campaign, delivered a speech about faith and Mr. Biden’s character and leadership. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta introduced an entire segment about the civil rights movement that unabashedly included the Christian convictions that motivated many of its leaders. Jon Meacham, the historian and a Christian himself, gave his perspective on the moral stakes of the election. Later in the night, Father James Martin, Rabbi Lauren Berkun and Imam Dr. Al-Hajj Talib ‘Abdur-Rashid delivered benedictions (Mr. Biden won the Muslim and Jewish votes by significant margins), with Father Martin directly mentioning the unborn in his prayer (as did the Rev. Gabriel Salguero in his invocation earlier in the convention), which communicated that pro-life voters were included in Mr. Biden’s vision for the Democratic Party and the country. The Biden campaign’s concern for faith voters was evident in its staffing as well, which included a faith outreach team, led by Josh Dickson, that relentlessly communicated to diverse communities of faith that the Biden campaign wanted their vote. Other Biden campaign aides, like Jen O’Malley Dillon, Mike Donilon, Greg Schultz, Bruce Reed, Ashley Allison, John McCarthy, Sheila Nix and others have long histories working with the faith community, so it wasn’t just Mr. Dickson who was attentive to these dynamics.
