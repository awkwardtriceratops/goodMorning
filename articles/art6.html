By Jill Cowan Good morning. On Monday, rounding out a Labor Day weekend of record-breaking heat and stress on the state’s already strained power grid, Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Fresno, Madera, Mariposa, San Bernardino and San Diego Counties. That’s where large fires started burning over the weekend, prompting fresh waves of evacuations and sending plumes of smoke into the air and underscoring, once again, the devastating reach of California’s massive wildfires, driven by climate change. [Read the full article on the latest fires.] As of Monday morning, Cal Fire reported that eight people have died and more than two million acres have burned across the state this year, destroying more than 3,300 structures and narrowly edging out a 2018 record for most acres burned in a single year. More than 14,000 firefighters were still out battling the blazes. One of the larger blazes to erupt in recent days, the Creek Fire, grew quickly enough that 200 campers and visitors in the Mammoth Pool Reservoir area had to be rescued by helicopter — another cruel reminder that the fires are an increasingly unavoidable part of our reality, even if the outdoors are our only respite from the pandemic and punishing heat. This year, many of the biggest fires have been sparked by lightning and have been made difficult to contain by historic heat waves, which have become more severe as climate change drives the state’s swings between weather extremes.

Case in point: The El Dorado Fire near Yucaipa, which the authorities said was sparked on Saturday morning by a pyrotechnic stunt at a gender-reveal party. (It wasn’t even the first time a gender-reveal party has gone similarly awry.) And last year, Pacific Gas & Electric preemptively cut off power to millions of people in a chaotic effort to stop their equipment from starting dangerous wildfires, as they’ve done in the past. [Read about how prescribed burns could be the only way to curb the damage from wildfires.] The San Francisco Chronicle reported that more blackouts were likely in coming days, as meteorologists warned of hot, dry, windy weather. All of this doesn’t address the dangers of the heat itself. In the Bay Area, the National Weather Service tweeted that temperatures were above 90 degrees at 1:30 a.m. on Monday — a troubling sign that the heat this year hasn’t dissipated overnight, which would make the heat waves less dangerous. For millions of Californians, the oppressive heat is mixing with oppressive lingering smoke and worries about Covid-19. In the San Fernando Valley on Sunday, the temperature hit an alarming record: 121 degrees, just nine degrees cooler than the 130 degrees recorded in Death Valley, all of a couple weeks ago. It was the hottest temperature ever recorded on earth. (This article is part of the California Today newsletter. Sign up to get it delivered to your inbox each day.)
