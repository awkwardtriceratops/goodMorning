By Jim Tankersley, Jeanna Smialek and Alan Rappeport WASHINGTON — President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. formally announced his top economic advisers on Monday, choosing a team that is stocked with champions of organized labor and marginalized workers, signaling an early focus on efforts to speed and spread the gains of the recovery from the pandemic recession. The selections build on a pledge Mr. Biden made to business groups two weeks ago, when he said labor unions would have “increased power” in his administration. They suggest that Mr. Biden’s team will be focused initially on increased federal spending to reduce unemployment and an expanded safety net to cushion households that have continued to suffer as the virus persists and the recovery slows. In a sign that Mr. Biden plans to focus on spreading economic wealth, his transition team put issues of equality and worker empowerment at the forefront of its news release announcing the nominees, saying they would help the incoming administration create “an economy that gives every single person across America a fair shot and an equal chance to get ahead.” Mr. Biden’s picks include Janet L. Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chair, who if confirmed would be the first woman to serve as Treasury secretary; Cecilia Rouse of Princeton University, the first Black nominee to head the White House Council of Economic Advisers; and Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress think tank, who would be the first woman of color to run the Office of Management and Budget. All three have focused on efforts to boost worker earnings and reduce racial and gender discrimination in the economy. Ms. Tanden said in February that decades of rising income inequality were the consequence of “decades of conservative attacks on workers’ right to organize” and that labor unions “are a powerful vehicle to move workers into the middle class and keep them there.” The two other nominees to Mr. Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey, are economists who have long pushed for policies to advance workers and labor rights, and who advised Mr. Biden in his campaign as he built an agenda that featured several longstanding goals of organized labor, like raising the federal minimum wage and strengthening “Buy America” requirements in federal contracting. William E. Spriggs, the chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. labor union, hailed the selections on Monday for their experience in policy debates and their attention to issues of inequality. “We have not had a C.E.A. as focused on the role of fiscal policy and full employment since President Johnson,” Mr. Spriggs said in an email. The team’s embrace of deficit spending to boost the economy in the current crisis was highlighted in March in an op-ed article that Ms. Tanden and Ms. Boushey wrote with two co-authors, urging policymakers to spend big to help people, businesses and state and local governments endure the recession. “Given the magnitude of the crisis,” they wrote, “now is not the time for policymakers to worry about raising deficits and debt as they consider what steps to take.” Mr. Biden also named Adewale Adeyemo, a senior international economic adviser in the Obama administration, as deputy Treasury secretary. Mr. Adeyemo, who is known as Wally,would be the first Black man to hold the No. 2 role at Treasury. The nominees will be introduced on Tuesday. That event will not include another of Mr. Biden’s picks, the former Obama adviser Brian Deese, who has been tapped to lead the National Economic Council but was not included in Monday’s announcement. Mr. Biden’s team includes several labor economists, including Ms. Yellen, who has been a longtime champion of workers and has at times suggested running the labor market at very low unemployment levels — ones some economists thought imprudent — might be beneficial. While at the Fed, she balanced her preference for a strong labor market with inflation concerns and political constraints.
