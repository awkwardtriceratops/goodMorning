On Saturday, Pogacar surged ahead of his rival and seized the yellow jersey. By Elian Peltier As Tadej Pogacar and Primoz Roglic each took their heads in their hands, seconds after completing Saturday’s penultimate stage of the Tour de France, neither man seemed to be able to process what had just happened. Pogacar, 21, had just delivered the best performance of his young career, wiping out Roglic’s 57-second lead and opening a most likely insurmountable lead of his own entering Sunday, the race’s final day. The result ensured that he will enter Paris for the traditionally celebratory final stage wearing the leader’s yellow jersey, and positioned him so that he — not Roglic, the leader of the Tour for the past two weeks — will become the first rider from Slovenia to win the race. Roglic finished fifth in Saturday’s time trial, nearly two minutes behind Pogacar, who earned his third stage win of this year’s Tour by turning in one of the most memorable performances in the race’s illustrious history. “Unforgettable,” Pogacar said as his emotions overwhelmed him. Several feet away, Roglic, his good friend, sat on the pavement, speechless and struggling to catch his breath. “I think I’m dreaming,” Pogacar later said. Then he interrupted himself: Roglic had come to congratulate him, and the two hugged. Roglic was crestfallen. “I didn’t push enough,” he said. “I rode without the power that I needed.” Pogacar, of team UAE Emirates, is set to become the youngest winner of the Tour de France in the post-World War II era, and the second youngest champion ever. He also leads in the races for the competition’s best climber and best young rider, capping a Tour in which he showed his breadth of skills racing on flat roads, mountain passes and, finally, alone against the clock. The stage on Saturday capped an impressive duel between Pogacar and Roglic, and turned the tables after Roglic had expertly held off Pogacar’s attacks for more than a week. Roglic, 30, had led the Tour since its ninth stage, and he never seemed to be threatened. He was backed by his teammates on the Jumbo-Visma team, who maintained a fast pace while protecting their leader at the head of the peloton, riding alongside him as he kept Pogacar from breaking free day after day. But as Roglic rode alone on Saturday, he crumbled as much as Pogacar shone, and at the end of the stage, their positions had switched: Roglic, who was leading by 57 seconds in the general classification before the time trial, was left 59 seconds behind Pogacar.
