Was Sick. Now
It’s Sicker.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Supported by Peru’s government did far too little to protect its Indigenous people from the coronavirus, just as it has failed to protect them from the health threats of environmental contamination. By Joseph Zárate Mr. Zárate is a Peruvian journalist and an editor. LIMA, Peru — When he was a boy in the late ’80s, Elmer Hualinga would go to the nearby ravine to catch some odd fish. He’d see them floating on the water, motionless, covered in a slimy black substance. That didn’t seem to concern the elders of Nueva Andoas, Mr. Hualinga’s Quichua community in the Peruvian Amazon near the border with Ecuador. They would yank the creatures from the dark water, rinse them off and take them home to cook. Mr. Hualinga, 38, is now a Quichua leader himself. “I’m not going to blame my ancestors,” he tells me by phone, “but that’s how we ate, without knowing that we were contaminating ourselves.” The Quichua — or Kichwa — are one of 51 Amazon nations that have inhabited Peru for millenniums. And for almost half a century, they have lived in the basins of the Pastaza, Tigre, Corrientes and Chambira Rivers, territory they share with Block 192, the country’s largest oil field. The Block holds an infamous record: 155 oil spills in the last nine years. I listen to Mr. Hualinga from Lima, the capital of Peru — one of the most oil-dependent countries in Latin America — and I contemplate the high price Indigenous people in the Amazon pay so that we can sustain our comfortable lives. “Black gold” from the Peruvian Amazon fuels, along with natural gas and coal, 85 percent of the country’s energy consumption. Building a nation’s economy on the exploitation of its natural resources has a cost, but above all it incurs a debt. In Peru we owe that debt to the environment and Indigenous peoples. The pandemic — caused by a novel coronavirus that probably spread to humans from a wild animal in part as a result of the destruction of ecosystems in China — has increased this debt.
