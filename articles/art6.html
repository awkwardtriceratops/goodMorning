By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Lucy Tompkins A week after a violent storm tore through Iowa, toppling trees and leaving grain silos in crumpled heaps, residents of devastated places like Cedar Rapids were left wondering whether the rest of the nation had any sense of their plight. Between the coronavirus pandemic and the rush of news in a presidential campaign year, attention to the Midwest’s storm seemed to shift away especially quickly, residents said, leaving them feeling overlooked even as they dug through rubble. At one apartment complex in Cedar Rapids, residents whose homes were destroyed in the 100-mile-per-hour winds that left hundreds of thousands of Iowans without power have been living in tents. They cook meals on grills. Some who have chosen to try to stay inside step over splintered walls and hope that the building does not crumble further. Lemi Tilahun, a community organizer assisting people from the apartment complex, many of whom are refugees who escaped violence or natural disasters in their home countries, said he was shocked the city was not flooded with aid workers and journalists. “Some of my friends and relatives who are outside of the area had no idea what we were going through,” Mr. Tilahun said. “And it’s not just the national response that was missing; even locally, it wasn’t until Friday or over the weekend that the attention began to come to the apartment complexes.” Tyler Olson, who is on the Cedar Rapids City Council, said a lack of attention — and help — from outside had made efforts to recover from the storm even harder. “I think there was perhaps some underestimation by people outside the community the extent of the damage that had occurred here,” Mr. Olson said. The storm, known as a derecho, whipped through during about an hour’s time on Aug. 10, but thousands of people remain unable to go back to their homes and tens of thousands are still without power, Mr. Olson said. Along some roads, debris is piled six to 10 feet high. Recovery, he said, could take years. And even within local communities, the pandemic has further complicated the response to the storm’s destruction. “Typically, in a time like that, neighbors would shake hands and hug their neighbors,” Mr. Olson said, “and I think because of Covid, there was an extra level of disconnect and isolation.” More help has arrived in recent days after Iowa Starting Line, an online news outlet, published an article over the weekend about the city’s plight under the headline “It’s Even Worse Than You Think In Cedar Rapids.” Red Cross workers are helping. And on Tuesday, President Trump flew into the city for about 30 minutes on his way to Arizona for a campaign event. He spoke with local officials in an airport hangar about the devastation before returning to Air Force One. On Monday, Mr. Trump signed a disaster relief order that provided about $45 million for public utilities and buildings, but he did not approve money the state requested for individual homeowners and farmers, which local officials have said is desperately needed. “Don’t forget, this has been a very loving area for me. Cedar Rapids has been fantastic,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump won Iowa in 2016, although he lost Linn County, which includes the city, by about 10,500 votes. Angie Ward, who owns a local bar and grill, said she was worried that she may need to cover the bill for a tree that fell across her backyard. She said she was unimpressed with the president’s brief visit. “I was upset that Trump came to the airport and didn’t even leave to see the damage,” said Ms. Ward, who said she had voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 but no longer supported him.
