By The Editorial Board The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. In 2016 Scott Duncombe, a software developer in Portland, Ore., saw on the news that Cleveland residents had to wait hours in long lines to vote. His heart went out to them. In Oregon, there are never any lines because everybody votes by mail. So he called up a pizza place in Cleveland and ordered a bunch of food to raise their spirits. The effort grew. This year, the volunteer-driven nonpartisan project, Pizza to the Polls, has delivered more than 53,000 pizzas to polling places in 48 states. About 30 staff members and volunteers on Election Day were scanning for texts and social media posts from voters at polling sites with long lines. Their fleet of trucks, with “Democracy is delicious” printed across the side, also handed out free milkshakes, burgers and empanadas. “Instead of doomscrolling Twitter, this is a way to bring a lot of joy,” Mr. Duncombe said. There’s something beautiful about that. For all the drama, anxiety, animosity and fear this election has brought, it has also brought many examples of patriotic volunteerism, much of it nonpartisan. As contentious and scary and possibly violent as this election might turn out to be, Americans are fighting for the future of a country that we all agree is worth fighting for. Voters have turned out in record numbers. Volunteers are making sure their votes are counted quickly and correctly. They are helping voters maintain social distance, sanitizing pens and handing out the iconic “I Voted” stickers. Tens of thousands of young people volunteered to serve as poll workers, replacing the seniors who typically fill the role but did not feel comfortable doing so amid the pandemic. That volunteerism is even more notable since it is happening during a pandemic. The most consequential election in generations is taking place during a year when politicians and campaign volunteers can’t go door-to-door as they did before. Instead of feeling defeated, Americans came up with creative ways to meet the moment. Jazz musicians put on a virtual benefit concert. Video gamers and entertainers are using the livestream platform Twitch to encourage voting with a 12-hour Election Day virtual party called #TwitchTheVote. The singer Leslie Odom Jr., star of the musical “Hamilton,” released a video of himself singing “Wait for It,” to encourage Americans to be patient and wait for all votes to be counted. The video is a public service announcement promoted by RepresentUs, a grass-roots anti-corruption campaign. Across the country, all kinds of people have thrown themselves into this election, in ways big and small. Katie Mazzocco, a small-business owner in Pittsburgh, fell ill with Covid-19 in March and has been bedridden — yet found the strength to write 300 postcards to get out the vote. A Ukrainian immigrant, Yana Duke, who said she hadn’t had much involvement in politics before, decided to throw herself into volunteering for a campaign and distributing yard signs in Cincinnati. Joe LaMuraglia, a resident of Savannah who has been staying in Boston during the pandemic, drove all the way to Georgia and back — a trip of about 2,000 miles — just to cast his vote after his absentee ballot did not arrive in the mail. In August, just after the Democratic National Convention took place virtually, Margo Wright, a Black woman in Brooklyn who founded an educational technology company, wanted to do something to increase voter turnout in Black communities. She feared that the pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt Black people, would rob them of their chance to vote. So she pulled together a group of like-minded friends who built a website to help people figure out how to vote early and in person in places where they were eligible to do so. Their nonpartisan effort, VoteEarly2020, is just one of many volunteer-driven projects responsible for the wild success of early voting this year. More than 100 million Americans cast their ballots before Election Day, more than double the number in 2016. That’s astonishing — and inspiring. It is easy to be overwhelmed reading about efforts to suppress the vote — like the shameless attempts by Republicans in Texas to throw out more than 127,000 votes cast in Harris County. But that despair should be balanced by the stories of trained volunteers who are standing by to rescue ballots in Georgia, Pennsylvania and North Carolina that were rejected for minor reasons, like signatures that don’t seem to match. Those volunteers have been reaching out to voters whose ballots have been rejected and are trying to “cure” them, sometimes by getting those voters to the polls to cast in-person provisional ballots. The 2020 election has turned brother against sister and father against son. And it has resonated through the generations. In Chicago, a lawyer named Anurima Bhargava made a video about losing her brother a few weeks before Joe Biden had lost his son. In the video, she talked about what Mr. Biden told her parents about their shared loss, and how much his words meant to her family. Nobody paid her to make that video. She made it because she wanted to tell her fellow Americans about the importance of having a president who intimately knows death, especially in the midst of a pandemic. It is notable that a widely read argument in support of re-electing President Trump was penned not by the Trump campaign but by an ordinary supporter, Robby Starbuck. His list of Trump accomplishments was viewed by nearly two million people on Twitter alone. You don’t have to agree with what he wrote to feel proud to live in a country where ordinary people have a voice. Yes, the election has been nerve-racking. We live in a country where too many Americans are forced to wait in unacceptably long lines to vote, especially if they are Black and poor. But we also live in a country where perfect strangers send them pizza to make their waits a bit easier. Yes, corrupt politicians are scheming to throw out ballots they assume were cast by the other side. But armies of ordinary citizens are making it their business to ensure that as many votes are counted as possible. The only thing that keeps our democracy intact is our shared belief in it and our communal willingness to guard against threats. That’s the same spirit that impressed Alexis de Tocqueville about the United States all those years ago: The civic spirit of volunteerism, on the part of ordinary people, is what links us together and makes us whole. With the nation as divided as it is, facing major challenges from coast to coast, we’re going to need a lot more of it. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
