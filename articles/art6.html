By Adam Liptak WASHINGTON — At least five justices of the Supreme Court, including two members of its conservative majority, indicated on Tuesday that they would vote to reject the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, an effort pressed by Republican state officials and supported by the Trump administration. It was not clear whether the court would strike down the so-called individual mandate, which was rendered toothless in 2017 after Congress zeroed out the penalty for failing to obtain insurance. But the bulk of the sprawling 2010 health care law, which is President Barack Obama’s defining domestic legacy, appeared likely to survive its latest encounter with the Supreme Court. In legal terms, the key justices said the mandate could be severed from the rest of the law. “It does seem fairly clear that the proper remedy would be to sever the mandate provision and leave the rest of the act in place — the provisions regarding pre-existing conditions and the rest,” said Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. made a similar point. “Congress left the rest of the law intact when it lowered the penalty to zero,” he said. The court’s three-member liberal wing — Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — also indicated their support for the law. That suggested there were at least five votes to uphold almost all of it. Three members of the court’s conservative majority — Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch — seemed poised to vote to strike down the law. The court’s newest member, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, was harder to read, though she has been publicly critical of earlier rulings sustaining key provisions of the law. Striking down the law would increase the ranks of the uninsured in America by about 21.1 million people — a nearly 70 percent increase — according to new estimates from the Urban Institute. The biggest loss of coverage would be among low-income adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the law after all but a dozen states expanded the program to include them. But millions would also lose private insurance, including young adults whom the law allowed to stay on their parents’ plans until they turned 26 and families whose income was modest enough to qualify for subsidies that help pay their monthly premiums. The law includes popular provisions on guaranteed coverage for pre-existing medical conditions, emergency care, prescription drugs and maternity care. A lawyer for Texas and other Republican-led states, supported by a lawyer for the Trump administration, argued that all of those provisions must fall as a consequence of the 2017 change to the individual mandate. Those arguments were largely based on a decision in an earlier Supreme Court case. In 2012, the court upheld the law’s requirement that most Americans obtain insurance or pay a penalty. The vote was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice Roberts writing the controlling opinion, which said the mandate was authorized by Congress’s power to assess taxes. He was joined by what was at the time the court’s four-member liberal wing. Since the mandate no longer raises revenue, said Kyle D. Hawkins, Texas’s solicitor general, it cannot be justified as a tax and was therefore unconstitutional. In assessing the narrow question of the constitutionality of the revised mandate, the justices discussed hypothetical laws that merely urged people to do things without penalizing them if they disobeyed. Chief Justice Roberts asked about a law requiring people to mow their lawns, Justice Clarence Thomas about one requiring people to wear masks, Justice Kavanaugh about one requiring people to fly the American flag and Justice Breyer about one urging people to buy war bonds. Michael J. Mongan, California’s solicitor general, said that without penalties for noncompliance such laws present no constitutional problems. As for the revised mandate, he said, “it doesn’t require anybody to do anything.” Justice Kagan noted what she said was a curious features of the challengers’ argument. In 2012, she said, the Supreme Court had ruled that the mandate backed by a penalty was not an unconstitutional command. In 2017, she said, the law became less coercive. “How does it make sense to say that what was not an unconstitutional command before has become an unconstitutional command now, given the far lesser degree of coercive force?” she asked. Chief Justice Roberts noted that the mandate had in the earlier case been said to be “the key to whole act.” Justice Thomas said the court had been told that “this provision was the heart and soul of the Affordable Care Act.” Indeed, when the earlier challenge to the health care law was argued in 2012, the Obama administration did say that the mandate could not be severed from two related provisions, one prohibiting insurers from turning away applicants and the other barring them from taking account of pre-existing conditions. Donald B. Verrilli Jr., who successfully defended the law in 2012 as solicitor general in the Obama administration and appeared as lawyer for the House of Representatives on Tuesday, said experience had shown that the practical importance of the mandate had been overstated. The health care law, he said, included both carrots, like subsidies, and the stick that was the mandate. “It’s turned out that the carrots worked without the stick,” he said. The elimination of the law’s financial penalty for going without health insurance has indeed had little effect on how many people signed up for coverage through the law’s marketplaces. Enrollment in the marketplaces has decreased slightly since 2017, but it has not shown any signs of a “death spiral,” when only sick people buy coverage and costs skyrockets as a result. Whether the mandate was now unconstitutional or not, Mr. Verrilli said, the balance of the law must stand. It was far-fetched, he said, that Congress had intended to doom the law by adjusting a monetary penalty as opposed to repealing it outright. “There were efforts to repeal the entire A.C.A.,” Mr. Verrilli said, “Those efforts failed.” Chief Justice Roberts said that adjusting the penalty while leaving the rest of law in place was telling. “It’s hard for you to argue that Congress intended the entire act to fall if the mandate were struck down,” the chief justice told Mr. Hawkins, “when the same Congress that lowered the penalty to zero did not even try to repeal the rest of the act.” Justice Kavanaugh also said that the whole law was not tied to the fate of the mandate. “I tend to agree with you,” he told Mr. Verrilli, “that it’s a very straightforward case for severability under our precedents.” The case, California v. Texas, No. 19-840, was brought by Republican officials who said the mandate became unconstitutional after Congress in 2017 zeroed out the penalty for failing to obtain health insurance because it could no longer be justified as a tax. They went on to argue that the mandate was a crucial feature of the law, meaning that every other part of it should be wiped out. The challenge has largely succeeded in the lower courts. A federal judge in Texas ruled that the entire law was invalid, but he postponed the effects of his ruling until the case could be appealed. In December, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, agreed that the mandate was unconstitutional but declined to rule on the fate of the remainder of the health law, asking the lower court to reconsider the question in more detail. In the Supreme Court, the law’s defenders hoped that the Republican challengers could not run the table on three separate legal arguments they would need to win: that they have suffered the sort of injury that gives them standing to sue; that the zeroing out of the tax penalty made the individual mandate unconstitutional; and that the rest of the law cannot stand without the individual mandate. Judging by the questioning on Tuesday, in an argument that lasted for two hours, the law’s defenders seemed poised to prevail on at least the third issue. A ruling is expected by June.
