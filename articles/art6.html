By Kara Swisher Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing Opinion writer. The stories of gender exclusion I heard this week from women working at Pinterest and their former colleagues were numbingly similar, with most using the same words over and over again: Sidelined. Shut down. Doors closed. Inner circles. Toxic secrecy. Homegrown boys club. Left out of meetings. Out of key decisions. Out of promotions. Out. Which is why the essay “The Pinterest Paradox: Cupcakes and Toxicity,” published on Medium by its recently ousted chief operating officer, Françoise Brougher, landed with a definitive boom. Ms. Brougher has also filed a lawsuit against the social media company — whose service lets users compile and share collections of images — saying she was fired after she complained about gendered treatment. It follows another suit last month by a top female executive against a financial technology start-up, Carta, alleging pay discrimination and retaliation. Ms. Brougher’s excruciating on-the-record post about her time at Pinterest also resounds with a tiresome familiarity for those who have been monitoring the diversity struggle in Silicon Valley for a while now. Her tale is one of a woman who had held top positions at Google and Square and then found herself in her most powerful digital role yet — the No. 2 executive at Pinterest — but without any power. It’s not unlike the gender discrimination battle that Ellen Pao waged against the powerful venture firm Kleiner Perkins more than seven years ago and the devastating blog post about sexual harassment and inequality written by a former Uber employee, Susan Fowler, more than three years ago. (Ms. Fowler is now an editor for Times Opinion.) TRANSCRIPT So anyway, it’s funny. My son is going to college this week, and we had a long talk about oh no name anyway. That’s a little interesting soon. May 15. I mean mid-September may 15th. All right. Do any mail sorting machines. Elon musk is making them. That’s a crazy story. You know what that is really awful. It’s what I think it’s probably the number one more story. The problem is he’s doing his crime in public and a little too early so people can do something about it. It’s sort of like robbing a bank and wandering around with the money in a bag. It’s the sack that you know that the die. That’s in it has popped and it’s all over him. Yeah Yeah. I’m hoping that we’ll get this sorted out before the election anyway. Fair and square. I mean, it seems like the talking economy doing the postal thing. It’s just like every little dirty trick it’s like out in plain sight. And I think, by the way, I do know, Kanye West a little bit. I know his wife Kim Kardashian quite well. But I’ve interviewed her several times and know her as someone I’ve interviewed and I have to tell you taking advantage of someone with a mental illness is really about the worst thing you can do. He’s obviously troubled you should be able to run for president. He wants. But it’s clear that he’s being misused by the Republicans in that regard. I’m sorry. He’s such a brilliant guy. I know he had such an image of Taylor Swift everything else. But brilliant, brilliant creative and visionary and undeserving of this. What’s happening right now, even if he thinks in charge anyway, the gender scream is worse than racist rejection. I don’t think so. I think they’re all in the same bucket. It’s leaving people out with different opinions, which different ways of communicating with. Not that everybody has everybody different communicating. But it’s keeping a small group of people who don’t have all the information the best information in charge. And that’s a really hard. And I run things I have not done imperfectly by any stretch of the imagination. It’s really hard not to have people you trust you know and just keep them in a tight circle. It’s really hard to figure it out is really hard to pick up as we’re doing this podcast. I’m thinking a lot about diversity. We thought about that. What would the staffing and not just that, which I think we have a very diverse staff right now for the new podcast and other things. But when I think about the speakers and interviewees and stuff like that. I’m thinking really hard about that and not just because like, let’s have a person of color do this. It’s because I want to find interesting voices. It’s really it’s a bit difficult. I was really struck this week by Dolly Parton’s statement about this whole interview on billboard which you should read about this issue and she’s as usual. She’s so sensible about everything about matter is all kinds of stuff. And he essentially bromide was don’t be a dumb ass. Don’t be a dumb ass. I love Dolly Parton she’s my favorite person ever or one of them. Are you OK. OK You must love the muppets on Hamilton I will. I would be happy to. You should go read it. It’s a really strong piece. I’m going to have another one Monday or Tuesday. That’s pretty strong too. Anyway, I love how you didn’t say, listen to Andrew Russell let’s go. He’s not interrupted like Mr. Galloway Andrew Ross Sorkin from the New York Times was my guest host this week Scott’s off for the month of August even though we’re doing pivot live every week. So how can I simply won’t go away and interrupt Sorkin and I were really quite sassy together. I have to say I have a possibility of another marriage at least in the background. Let’s face going to clamp down on the q crazies they are not. It’s really every day every week, Facebook manages to top their what they’re doing. I would recommend reading Kevin ruess in The New York Times on this. And he’s been the top right on this. I recommend other writers some other newspapers. But in this case Kevin is really killing it, so to speak talking about QAnon a lot of people are being played by QAnon in ways you don’t realize and there should be more reporting about this. No, this is the house. I live in. My studio is the other house. I will sell it as soon as I can. I can’t afford two houses anyway, just called it. Guest cove does what it is Look, I’ll just sit quietly and work all the time. So I can pay for it all. Does inclusion really matter outside of ideological diversity what you mean precisely. I think diverse thinking always leads to better outcomes. I think it’s true. I’d like to get away from politically correct. And all this other bullshit cancel culture stuff. I do think that it’s called I call it cross feedback I guess. And I think it’s really important to have different voices and different way people communicate. I’ve always had a better outcome the more people I listen to always. I don’t think there’s any time I can think of that. I don’t. When you keep a tight group of homogeneous people in this case, in Silicon Valley largely white men always men. You’re going to get a different outcome. It doesn’t create a it doesn’t create a really robust kind of thing that you want. You’re trying to be creative. There was a baby anyway. Yes, she is. Louis going to NYU and we’re taking him up there next week. Scott thought he wasn’t going to get in. But get that get them going. But NYU is opening. He’s going to go up for two weeks in quarantine. And so this morning. I turn over his bank account to him, which was interesting. All the money I’d saved money as a kid from the birthdays and stuff. And I got a tattoo and it looks great. So he’s a me, man. Anyhow thank you. The title is nice. My son made it. My son my oldest son, Louis he was going to college. Young men are demonized no they’re not. I have two young men and they’re not demonized. They know because they know how to behave. So that’s why they’re decent empathetic people. Not always, but they try to be anyway. Women can’t be toxic to in fact. Yes, of course, they can. But that’s not the point here. The point is this is most of these companies are run by men and they are just the fact of the matter. You can look at the statistics you argue with me. I didn’t say women couldn’t be toxic. They can absolutely create toxic environments non diversity results in toxicity more than it doesn’t. If you have more people. And it’s how you communicate with people that they’re included that their thoughts are good. Now look at all companies. Is everyone going to agree or they’re not going to be our problem. There’s not going to be a set course, there’s going to be sexual harassment problems. There’s going to be exclusion there’s going to be all kinds of things. And you deal with them on it. On a case by case basis. I’m talking about systemic problems. And I think that’s really what was on the deal here. The big four or horrible diversity inclusion exclusion is probably even more important. And one thing that France was talked about I think was really important was retention and promotion. And I think a lot of there’s a lot of attention being brought to bring people in and then things don’t work. Retention is I think one of the things that’s hard to get in there and the atmosphere is not the atmosphere, you’re comfortable breathing. And I heard that from. So many people. That’s really where the problems happen. Women tend to make too. I don’t want to hear from Ben Shapiro and women at all. Let it slip. It’s not my assistant. I know. Hush hush hush. He’s my producer. Facebook is out of no nonsense. Yeah, it wasn’t at all. It’s been out of control. Kevin has been writing this for months and months and years, if not years, then it’s fine. You need to give him the talk now. Talk to me when he talks. OK Is there something deputy rather than blank statements. Yeah, there’s all kinds of things. I think we’ll see. I don’t think it’s really depressing. It’s exhausting. It’s meant to be exhausting. It’s meant to be exhausting. The whole point is to exhaust you over here. And then we’re here for here. I loved you in after truth. How will hairs impact the future. That’s interesting. She’s quite tech friendly and yet. I think she also has some tech on friendliness in her Andrew Ross Sorkin on the podcast. This week said he thought nothing was going to happen that middle of the road. And I suspect they’re correct that the suspect there are correct. Karma I will be interviewing her. I’m sure I know her pretty well. She was my I met her when she was district attorney of San Francisco. She’s been on stage with me 1, 2 times and she’s excited to interview her when I do when I get the opportunity to do social justice where it hurts women and minorities. It’s not social justice warrior for fairness, I’m sorry. Such a Riddick I’m pushed that’s ridiculous. I’m sorry. It’s bullshit. It’s things have been going a certain way for years. And everyone finally said the same thing with Black lives matter police brutality enough there’s a word called enough and enough is enough. And if you can’t create a diverse inclusive cultures you’re going to have to it’s just things have changed. You might well cop and you can call us all the names you want as a social justice warriors. You can say you know, politically correct. You can do cancer whatever you go ahead knock yourself out, but you know give it a rest. Give it a rest. It’s time for more voices to be heard. Period that’s it. That’s the way it is. That’s the way it is now. And this is welcome to 2020. Such that it is. Why don’t you flaunt your wealth more. I don’t spend a lot of money. I don’t know. I have a car. I have a nice house. I’m trying to make money. If I have money matter to me. I would have taken those jobs. I was offered all the internet companies, many years ago. So it obviously doesn’t that I’d be stuck in one of these situations because I am like France was very direct. She says she’s French and she is a nice way of putting it. Is there a name for the package. Yes Hillary’s trusted staff. One of being awful gatekeepers. OK No one talked about Hillary Clinton. How does that work. Tech pros flirting with me. I don’t know. I don’t know should happen. She’s are channeling John. Yet I’ve had these for decades John pooch. Anyone who doesn’t know that is from a show chips California Highway Patrol. It was a great punch John in politics right. And Twitter suffers. Yes the inner surgeon is energetic. He was rather sassy. Honestly when you think about apple blocking fortnight in the App Store I’d be happy to talk about that. I probably will write about it. I wrote two weeks ago about the issue on the App Store in regards to base camp, and I was talking about the overall issue. I think it’s a mistake by Google and Facebook. I mean, Facebook. I’m sorry apple if you do this right now mean fortnight the CEO of epic is just going to fight, right back. I think it’s I think the developers feel emboldened by this and this idea of monopoly and antitrust and so then you know they’re going to have to drop the fees. That’s what they’re going to do, the fact that there’s just two of them isn’t good, isn’t a good look. One or two of our tech startups I just I mean, one of these ethical people I should have. I was just telling my son we got some money. He had saved and I said a shit about just Amazon stock. And I couldn’t at the time and even now I really like PepsiCo good life. Thank you. The game show is hysterical. Thank you. Please Next week is dark for shocking. Next week is tinder dry. And then one more left TBD. I think we have concluded the president of Howard talking about learning. So they’re going all remote. Unlike my son’s school. I don’t know enough about Cuba not to know who’s behind it. Take on the upcoming Michael Cohen book. Oh, Yeah, I’ve got some tapes. I tweeted that. It’s amazing that golden showers at a sex club in Las Vegas was not the worst of it actually whatever. I’m from San Francisco live and let live. And that one. I don’t care. I mean, it’s interesting, but like the porn star. Well, now that’s even that’s something different. The porn stars. It’s the cheating I guess I suppose I don’t know. I’m not going to dispute Donald Trump’s various peccadilloes having to do with its sexual life. It’s kind of not something I want to talk about ever. Anyway, I think it’s you know, it’s interesting. I think Michael Cohen appears to be spent his life being a liar for someone who is a liar. So who do you believe and what happens when a liar is telling the truth. That’s the problem you have with Michael Cohen. But you know, I think probably much of what he’s saying about Donald Trump is accurate directionally it’s correct. Why does the Fed use Google for contact. They’re using a lot of people, not just Google. But you know that wasn’t. That was their White House doing that. What’s the one thing you think Facebook should do that can will do ban all these groups by ban all these dangerous groups. I would rejoice in the touch. You get it’s the San Francisco scene. He grew up there. My son and daughter Mozilla. So yeah, I read about this. I don’t know enough to comment on it. I just. That’s too bad. That’s a good group of people over there. As I recall I haven’t talked to them in awhile. But I thought that what they were doing was pretty cool. Which congresspersons are on top of tech issues and the best hope for effective legislation. Amy Klobuchar Mark Warner Ron widen. There are Republicans Josh Hawley if he would get off on the conservative bias highway. He’s actually quite intelligent about stuff. There’s a bunch. There’s a lot a lot of trauma Dale been a drum issue sort of Microsoft tons. Stacey Abrams knows quite a bit. She’s on Congress. But she does for sure. OK, so we have some questions. First of all, I mean plug the lineup for the rest of the week for next week Monday, April 17. Jennifer Senior Tuesday Jameel Bouie whose great Wednesday. Michelle Cottle they’re all great Thursday. Farhad Manjoo and they’re all 11:00 AM it’s a new time and Friday is Frank Bruni And it’s all about the convention. I’m not going to be honest. I have nothing to say about it, honestly. Anyway, let’s ask the article comment. The 70% of the women that use Pinterest need to hold the organization accountable for its illegal and abortion treatment of Mrs. brower Xamarin Ms shimizu banks. Corporate culture comes from the top down Mr. Silverman surrounded by his country of men needs to come out of his glass tower and make some real changes and force the women need to resort to public media to get equitable treatment in the workplace. Thank you all these men for speaking out. He’s talking about some other those other women were arrested. They were on racial issues and racial discrimination. Yeah Pinterest is 70% women. That’s what’s interesting. I remember thinking when I met the founding team. It was all men and all their client all their customers are women. And I was like, do you think you’ve got a problem here. I don’t know. Maybe you could hire a woman somewhere. Anyway that was very early on. This is another letter from Carolyn. I admire the former Ceo’s bravery to come forward. There’s only downside doing this that she’s doing it to shine a light on gender restoration that exist sharing these firsthand experiences show how pervasive and acceptable these behaviors are. On another note the shower and your responses are downright embarrassing for the public company’s CEO. I hope their board takes no. Yeah, he didn’t. Their answers were great. He was trying though I have to say, he’s got it. He’s very earnest and so I’m not going to whack him too much, but that’s why I put them in there because I don’t get any answers. He’s thoughtful and well he doesn’t. He said he’s got it. He can’t just set the table. He’s got to do something. And I agree with him on that. One thing that was interesting about her coming forward. She can’t. She’s a powerful woman. She’s made a lot of money. One thing she did acknowledge is that she didn’t do enough when she was in a more powerful position for the issue. She didn’t find it is pervasive as she did at Pinterest but she felt like she should have done a lot more. And so I think this is paying it forward at this point for her. I don’t think she’ll back down. She’s got money means and power. So that’s what you’ve got to have. Sometimes money means and power. You probably get a similar Silicon Valley ages and ages and yes, you could actually. Dan Dan once wrote a great book about it made me laugh out loud. Anyway he was fake Steve Jobs. You should. It’s great. All right. The bro culture is incredibly rooted in tech. I worked and battled it for years. When the tech firms complain they cannot find them to work in tech. They blame ability. It’s not ability. It’s being unwelcome at the table who wants to work in their user. I considered only here a man with the same, to be congratulated. Article ran its Seattle newspaper awhile back lamenting America’s own workers do not find anyone to date when they don’t hire women a surprise. All right. OK, next one. So glad Mrs. Ms brower is suing them after a stellar career in companies such as Google and square. She should not have an assignment and treat the way she was CFO especially its shocking style as a job. Just another day in a baby huey. Yeah France was I did go back and talk to a lot of people. I had. She was hard to date because she didn’t she wasn’t in the limelight. She was very non-life like compared to most these people you know. They didn’t get a camera. They didn’t want to get in front of me and she had stellar reviews. And I talked to everybody up and down these organizations. And I know them. And she always had a good reputation. You know, really literally the toughest thing was she was really direct could be very direct. You know, some people don’t like that too bad too bad. I say. So I am teaching my daughter to me and my sons are OK. I agree. Both men are meant to be text morality possible run by men. Exactly Yes. All of those experienced women as a single mom thought someone was leaving while folks hurting. I think it’s terrible. I’m on the east coast. I would trust her rich mother Elizabeth. OK When you think of a song. I love. I love the song. I just think they’re funny. The whole thing is so much to look at like I’m so unhappy. You know, whatever I was in a store today and they were playing. I can’t remember what it was. And I knew the lyrics. My purse was like like I look like a soccer mom. Like how do you know I’m like, you know what. I can. I know my music. I love can’t be there. I couldn’t believe I knew it. How did my career start. I was a copy aid at the Washington Post I delivered mail. I was a mail delivery at the Washington Post. It’s called a complicated. And then I worked my way up. Watch after truth is this is a Cuban on thing or anti coded because I won’t watch it. That’s the case. I’ll look it up. If it’s that no. How do you think Dreamforce being host to horizontal line. Oh, too. Is to take over San Francisco. I don’t know. I don’t know how they were leaving San Francisco now they’re not going anywhere. I mean business schools colleges to delete Facebook. No idea. You find to make a strong effort to solicit boys on teams to train you women. You know, I was thinking about that new team at the times that I had. I have tried really hard. I am aware of it. I’m quite aware of how I may ask questions and include people I’m obviously a strong personality. So I have to do. I’m trying to solicit not just the everyone go around and say, what you think. It’s hard. It’s hard all the time to make people feel comfortable really feeling safe giving. And that’s the worst feeling. Feeling like that their opinion matters. And even when they have a bad opinion to be able to take tough feedback. So when you think of the Ellen Show controversy. I it’s disappointing. I had heard those things everybody and heard those things about that show. But not the sexual harassment to sort of the dysfunctional nature of it. I don’t have any insight into it. I don’t watch the show. Someone who’s gay. It’s not great. Know the thought on me. It sounds like a really dysfunctional workplace is what it is. Pretty good reporting. Sounds like someone who is removed from the day to day operations and did not know what was going on. But that does not abrogate responsibility for that. So it seems like a bad dysfunctional workplace. Any concerns about Mozilla and the help. I don’t know. I don’t know enough about me, though I’m sorry. I don’t know. I will find out now is what I put on my protest. That’s a really good word. When we get this far and no further is another one I like this far and no further. How could you have taken us on board to champion DNA. Well, you don’t make it a separate thing. It’s a spin it’s always someone was telling me at Pinterest it’s like or any of these companies, they have a separate diversity person they always do. It’s often a person of color and sometimes a gay person. It should be the Ceo’s job. Every job at the company around diversity should be all top management’s job. I think that’s how I think it should be. I think if you just make it one person then it sort of creates this weird dynamic with the staff voices must be hard to make decisions yet. Why does it. Keep pouring your day to distribute. I don’t know. Ask Weinstein whatever we can do. That’s a lot of what’s a word salad from Eric Bornstein so whatever he wants to say whatever Eric. Knock yourself out. Give it a rest. That’s what I say. This sort of thing to a lot of people. They give it a rest. Any thoughts on the help that you guys have to ask this music because I can’t answer it. Anyone who’s not interviewing you want to yes. And I’m going to get them all for this New York Times podcast. Obviously Ali part Dolly Parton please for the love of Jolene. Give me an interview top piercings or Danish and 12% hording resources. I think the top 10% is actually a weird way. How do you get a Gardener growing on food. I do. I had tomatoes in the back. I had gardens for years and stuff. But not lately. I had one when I had a place in the country when I more land. I don’t have too many zucchini. That’s really how it all ends and always ends opportunities and candy, and then not enough peppers. That’s how it ends. I can be cooler. I don’t know why we’re two fathers. Oh my god you live in that district. She’s insane. She’s a wingnut. The woman Marjorie Marjorie wingnut. That’s what I call her. She’s crazy. I kind of go back and read where she interviewer now because like, why give a crazy person like that. Any kind of platform at the same time, literally. I don’t know what to say about her. She’s a wing nut. That’s what I have to say in San Francisco up speaker. No, I don’t know. I don’t know what that is curious students here. But how many streams of income do you have a lot. No, I don’t. I have contracts with everybody. And I do. I do. Well, I work hard. And I do. Well, let me just say, I have been I work for NBC Fox media, New York Times. I’m writing a book and maybe some TV show. OK I do a lot. OK, let’s see. People like me say she’s direct those who don’t say she’s too aggressive. Yes, I think that’s what France want. Let’s get back to the article. France while I was talking about the article is words like direct and collect not collaborative. These are words for don’t play well with boys tend to be or that Warrior Ii. She’s very transparent. I think is the word she used. And I think she’s right. It’s if your culture is not used to transparency and is used to see it as someone comes in and opens all the windows and curtains you’re like vampires you run around for the corners. Right and if you’re used to hoarding information. That’s what happened. TikTok I wrote a whole common tic tac. I think this is a ridiculous effort by the Trump administration. There’s other things they should be focusing on. Any thoughts about the state of browsers. Goodness a great question. How to handle this middle. My column about Mozilla I guess. Jack Dorsey might be ticked off. No he’s not going to get it. Do you think he will actually will leave California. I’m going to ask that question. Da Costa shot next week. I think it’s a bluff but it’s a good one. It’s a good one. Well text Rosa there’s quite a few Andrew and I talked about Bernie Sanders wild tax proposal. It was really interesting. We’ll see on that one. There’s a lot of room for Apple to compromise. They don’t want to fight this. You’re right. Well and why you do regular Kobe testing of students, yes. Yes In fact, my son just called me and told me his Kobe test is on Monday at 320 and I have to be there. I don’t know why I have to be there. I feel like I shouldn’t be there. But I love my son. I’m going to miss him so much. We’re very close. Patrick Collison right keeps like in conservative tweets. No Patrick’s. Patrick’s an interesting and thoughtful person. I think he’s just likes a lot of knowledge. I don’t. I’ll have to look. I have never known him to be anything but open minded and lots of things. I mean, he’s one time we were in. There’s a supermarket in the neighborhood. We live near each other in San Francisco. I ran into him. And he started talking about population control when I was trying to buy a peach. And I little was like like in detail about detailed data and just I think it was population dropped whatever. I wasn’t listening the entire time. I was like, should I get back to you that peach. He kept talking. He’s such a wonk and he’s like, I gotta go. And I was trying really hard to get away. And I think the woman he was with it might have been his girlfriend or his wife or whatever it was like understanding that I needed to leave him. He was not reading the speech room at all. But he’s very smart. I like I like him. How do we trust anybody. I trust people think Biden would debate Trump. Yes. Have debate. I’m not be dopey debating how does it feel to be financially stable in your car. Debt free. It feels good. It feels good. I don’t I feel nervous pain. I don’t I don’t have enough money for all of college. So we’ll see. He’s going to be working. My son’s going to be working quite a bit. In any case, we’ll see. We’ll see how that goes. Murmuring when I think college should be free and always I’m on the Bernie Sanders team. There’s gotta be some smarter way of doing our educational system. Remember when andreessen Horowitz kind of just India. Yes I remember that it was not good. How much responsibly on Facebook is on Sheryl Sandberg. What a disappointment she is. You know part of it. I still think it’s on mark. But people think I should be tougher on her. I still think it’s the CEO. Oh, my god. There’s so many messages I can’t stay here much longer. Let’s see. Let’s do one or two more here. These are long thoughtful questions. How many men at the company are hard charging a non-believer. This is a double standard. It’s just not. Yes, that was it. The CFO is well known for being hard charging and direct. So that’s the greatest number used to describe a man it is not very unless they’re incredibly annoying. I guess. Anyway, the subjects is now taken. It’s dressed up and given us racism sex is occurring more and more power must be taken especially from white males and workplaces made more diverse. Anybody with any honesty can say is entirely unjust to our assessment of the problem. The only solution is to increase education broadly and honestly assess what people are qualified for not only the various tech positions side of opposition says society has to offer and how the Kurds live with the results. The rest is just been compromise effective is that of jealousy can be petty it’s a resentment. Wouldn’t surprise me at all day’s work environment. If what I’ve just written is classic racist and sexist but I’ve added to the wash of the person that would be employed. Oh stop it. Stop it. Person here. Who is this person. I can put any list Daniel hell. You don’t have lists. That’s on our side. Let me just say that would be fine if it wasn’t so manifestly unfair for decades and decades and decades. I suppose you’re right in a fair society in a fair landscape. It’s not a fair landscape. It is just not. And as much as you like to pretend that is it’s not I talk to my kids about this a lot. Like they’re tall and they’re white, and their money and they have an advantage. It just do. It’s not a level playing field between them and other people. Even if they work hard even if they’re really smart. And so that’s all. It’s just how do you get to a more level playing field. Never going to be level by the way, because of means and class and where you live. But your nutrition everything else. So anyhow, I think that’s a false argument. And you know acting like a victim really could do better the victim. The victim mentality and most powerful people in the world. Always, always fascinates me anyway. Daniel k regardless of industry when you work in a boys club environment you are a curse to have a mind of your own. You may be deemed not a team player even if the team is totally juvenile and ineffective. I find myself in a work environment in my early 40s was eased out when the economy tanked the boys who studied where the power was, of course survived. They were paid less, which helped. 18 years later, a self-employed professional. And I’m able to conduct business the way they want and have never wanted and never looked back. It’s hard reestablishing your career in the 40s and 50s. You often wish for just a few more years of the old corporation. But in the end, the sooner the break is made the better. I would agree. I work, I tend to work alone. High lately. Yeah, that’s a great thought. Daniel OK. That’s interesting. How do companies create better systems that allow boys to give feedback about their workplace. Well, there’s all kinds of ways. I’m not an expert, you need to bring an expertise here to do that to be able. People feel that they don’t go overboard because sometimes some of these sites these women say go overboard nobody feels I can say whatever they want. And that’s different than having an adult discussion about inclusion right or exclusion. Really it’s about exclusion not inclusion. So it’s hard because some things just like on Facebook or Twitter gets out of hand sometimes. Twitter can be very intelligent and smart and full of insight and sometimes it can just be that wingnut central. There you have Marjorie from Georgia just spouting off about Satanic pedophiles really seriously. Marjorie stop. Anyway splinter net I would love to talk about or I may write about it next week someone can talk about it here. OK Still a few more times. And I have to go get my son some shrimp because he’s going away. By the way, the Clinton menstruation was insensitive. Yes, they were 100% on gay issues. I never forgive and well I can forgive them. I know I’m not I don’t forgive them from don’t ask, don’t tell. You’re 100% right. No, I’m not channeling Biden. He’s channeling me right in with Biden. Do you like that. That’s one of the expressions. One other thing I kind of like it. It’s so hokey. I like the whole hoagie thing. Biden’s got going on. It’s various. That’s very sweet. The kitchen. This is top of ridiculous. I work with printers. Yes Let me just tell you, I was not dangerous actually sent me someone who actually said exactly what the complainants all the people complained or the negative feedback set the conditions. So there you have it. And that doesn’t just get made that. That doesn’t get born that gets made. Women don’t really like sensitive guys chosen to be a little. My son is very manly. But thank you. He’s plenty manly. Thank you though, for the advice on raising a son, which I am going to ignore completely. What about gay men working in a broke culture. Do you perpetuate or not. I don’t know. I have to ask a gay man. I don’t know. It’s interesting. Gay men are different. All gay men are different from each other. They’re not the same. So some can be very exclusive. And some can be very inclusive. How can companies correctly look for ways to fix their culture. So it’s not on employees. All kinds of ways. There’s all kinds of tools. There’s expertise. There’s board members there’s more people. Et cetera so there’s a lot there’s a lot to do. And there’s a lot of interesting people working in that group want to divest anything. Yes, I do. Any advice you can give folks who wake up feeling lost and powerless trumpet or government. A lot of people feel that way, including in my own home. Not me. You just put down the news for a second. They are relentless exhausting grifters and so you’re going to have to just you know let’s just imagine he won. He wins on November 3. We might right. You have to just gird your mornings learn you know knowing your girds whatever it takes, you’re going to have to protest you’re going to have to be out there, you’re going to have to power. That is the one thing I can say. If you’re exhausted to bed. Sleep for 20 minutes, then get back up and get out there real hot Silicon Valley. OK And a fair amount of dating laborers you’re obsessed with your content. No you the math. The Washington Post. Yeah, I did. I did. I did. And later some people whose name I live work for. That was kind of interesting. Let me tell you the insight from being in the mailroom or delivering mail. Really talented people are nicer and less talented people, people with not too much talent were really unpleasant comparatively. That was my assessment from back there. Really talented people were quite kind. But really talented and learning about the higher ranking people who were really talented. I am a cool mom. Pinterest is contract with something across country and course is a concern. OK All right. Twitter is just help me moderate a comment on your video what you think of that. OK Your video vote. Video this one. OK whatever. What does my shirt say. Oh are we ready. Are we running today. No we are not. And we should stop with the Morris man. I don’t know where she went. She has. She has a investment company. I understand. Let’s see. What are the most exciting ideas. My last three. What are you most excited about regarding your times podcast. How we different from what we touch. Well, it can be a little more produced. I think that’s cool. I’m fascinated. I just was on a music call today and about doing all this other production that I was never we never did. We did pretty kept it pretty simple. We got to go. Listen my producer Eric Johnson was great stuff. And then others were great. You came on and went off over the years. Was Eric for most of it. He was on the last show you should listen to it. I dated a producer of that. But there’s a team. There’s a team music team, marketing team. There’s all these teams. So it’s really interesting. We had marketing and stuff like that. But it’s a lot more produced and a lot more hands on by other people, and they have opinions. So it’s harder because I sort of used to just decide myself. And so I’m welcoming it actually. We were just doing a trailer and I didn’t like when I said something and my voice went up. I didn’t like it was a large argument among a lot of people, whether that was the right thing. I think I won that one. But I lost a couple and they’re right. So I like that. And I’m excited about going international more than any other part should make lower pay the overtime proposal. I don’t think you can download TikTok no one Bergstrom but it’s phenomenal app all free content Qube white people are even running from why they’re sort of cream. And then we get redder. There was this big bigger dumpster fire in the tech world. I don’t know. All right. Are you OK. OK Is Putin just unfairly maligned place. No no he’s not. He’s an he’s a terrible person. And by the way belarus tried to start to pay attention of what’s going on in belarus. Why do people not know Tom cook is gay. Because we don’t know who Tom cook is Tim cook is indeed gay. If you have been fascinating coming out in business week if we are to look for a couple of days. This size of basically yes the caning they are OK. I don’t do this and no further from joke. Thank you. Yes this is Marjorie. I don’t know. I just I think I do read Jim Jordan. I’ve asked him. That’s about it. He backed her. He had been getting my money. I think he’s a he’s someone I need to talk to. I know people don’t like him, but I’m going to talk to a lot of people, people are like. And I don’t mean not like the average conservative. They are interesting including what the son of Susan rice is I hear you’re talking about. I interviewed Susan several times. I think like me and Harvard for debate. That sounds great. I don’t know about. They have a lot of talk about dummies they’re taking it out. OK, let’s see. Thank you favorite city to live in. I like them all. I like say I love Miss San Francisco. I like d.c. I like New York. I love Rome should have a Netflix show. Thank you with me there. Well dolly was married the District of Marjah is running. I don’t think Donnelly likes Marjorie. That would be my guess on that. I think she’d be cordial and sweet because that’s what she is. But I think she’s she would cover a dumb ass. I believe in jails and trumps truth. Now we’re going to let him off. Just let Nixon off. How do you tweak to this platform. Sorry about that platform to make it more palatable to women, minorities. I don’t know. That’s a larger question who will be producing a new podcast. A lot of people. There’s going to be a ton and you will see. You will hear all their names. You will hear everybody’s names. There’s quite a team. OK You’re meeting the Lord of the Flies in there. OK We will do that. I mean, Brian Chesky many times what skills you earned while working in contributed success in journalism and in the mailroom I always deliver the mail. That’s what I learned. I always deliver the friggin mail. And guess what. Those postal workers are going to do it. The journalists are going to do it. That’s what we do all day long as we deliver the mail and neither snow or sleet, or no rubber left whatever they’re saying is late or rain or dark of night. Just stop us from our appointed rounds. That is what we’re going to do. So you can keep gunman this far and no further. That’s how I feel about things today. All right. Same thing with winters I think Ben let me give a shout out to Ben Francois. Amazing courage for coming forward. Good for you. But then good for you for talking to me. I know it’s on easy. And I appreciate it. I don’t think your answers were as good as they could be. But I know you cannot. And I think you will do the right thing. I’m hoping I’m hoping you will. And I hope you will not just set the table that really change things. I think this is a wake up call. It shouldn’t take as you said, a public outcry to change things, but it has. And so use this as an opportunity. Everything is an opportunity to do better anyway. Again, I love, love. I’m like Joe Kennedy Junior. But I like it Marquise ad. It’s the best that I’ve ever seen. If you’ve never seen it go see it anyway. Thank you. Again, we deliver the mail and nothing is going to stop us from doing it. Anyway you guys have a great week. I’ll be back after the convention. Maybe I’ll pop in and talk about the dimension. There’s a lot of digital stuff going on there probably right next week about something I think another really interesting interview with a woman who you are going to want to hear from. Anyway if you cannot write with them. Yeah, you can vote in person. Thank you. But we have covered. So stay safe. And also actually make sure that you stay safe for everybody else not for you for everybody else. Anyway thank you. “Although 70 percent of Pinterest’s users are women, the company is steered by men with little input from female executives. Pinterest’s female executives, even at the highest levels, are marginalized, excluded and silenced. I know because until my firing in April, I was Pinterest’s chief operating officer,” Ms. Brougher wrote. “According to Pinterest, I was fired not for the results I achieved, but for not being ‘collaborative.’ I believe that I was fired for speaking out about the rampant discrimination, hostile work environment and misogyny that permeates Pinterest.” The company has declined to comment on Ms. Brougher’s allegations, but its chief executive and co-founder, Ben Silbermann, spoke with me more generally about the issues. I interviewed Ms. Brougher, as well as many others, and the picture emerges clearly that, even as the country has, the technology industry has not made progress in building a fairer and more heterogeneous culture. Pinterest appears to have a profoundly dysfunctional culture where far too many of its roughly 2,000 employees feel left out. In addition to Ms. Brougher’s lawsuit, Black former employees have publicly complained about racial bias at Pinterest. The company has since initiated an independent investigation into its practices and policies. Welcome to what happens when tech start-ups that are created by people who have no real management experience grow large. It’s complex, of course, but it also remains inexplicable that an industry that so loudly purports to celebrate meritocracy is actually a mirror-tocracy — reflecting only those who look just like themselves. Across the board at tech companies, diversity numbers have hardly budged. Men — most of whom are white — dominate managerial jobs and the key ranks of engineers. As is often said, at this point it’s not a bug but a feature.
