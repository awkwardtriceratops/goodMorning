If you ever cook to meet your mood, then next week could be quite a ride in the kitchen — a time for drink mixing and nacho making? Maybe you embrace noodles in uneasy times, or pasta, or stew? Are you an anxiety baker? When I sat down to pick recipes for you for this particular week, a theme emerged: carbs. I decided to go with it. Look, I know this is not the most health-conscious edition of this newsletter. Some of you don’t even eat carbs! Do what you must to take care of you, and I’ve given you a few options below that might work. But if your brand of self-care includes an outrageous recipe for baked macaroni and cheese, then I am here for you.
