Slotnik [Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Friday. Weather: Sunny and pleasant, with a high in the upper 60s. It warms to the upper 70s on Saturday, then cools off again on Sunday, with a scattered sprinkle. Alternate-side parking: In effect today. Suspended on Saturday for Shemini Atzereth. Mayor Bill de Blasio suggested ZIP codes, but Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo insisted on zones. Each of the politicians issued maps designating coronavirus hot spots in Brooklyn and Queens where schools and businesses would have to close and houses of worship would be restricted, based on his preferred method of drawing boundaries. The maps overlapped and contradicted each other. Businesses and schools to be closed on one map were not on the other. Religious leaders, local officials and residents acknowledged the need to prevent a full-blown second wave of the coronavirus, but they bridled at the haphazard way the new measures were announced. [How will we know a second virus wave has arrived in the city?] After much back-and-forth between state and city officials, searchable maps were finally released on Wednesday night, but many residents remained confused as restrictions began to go into effect. Sunday: Mr. de Blasio proposed his ZIP-code-based plan, which he wanted to start on Wednesday. But he needed Mr. Cuomo’s approval to put it into action. Monday: Mr. Cuomo approved school closures but moved them up to Tuesday, giving parents and teachers less time to prepare. Tuesday: Mr. Cuomo released his own maps with color-coded zones, using red for hot spots, orange for areas of heightened concern and yellow for precautionary areas. But the maps the state gave to City Hall were flawed, according to city officials, leaving people to guess whether their schools or stores had to close. Wednesday: The city spent so long working out boundary details with the state that the maps were not released until 8 p.m. Wednesday, hours after the city had hoped to release them. The plans differ in other ways.
