By Liam Stack and Joseph Goldstein A group of mostly young men began descending on the Brooklyn home of a Hasidic journalist just before midnight on Sunday. The men, who were fellow ultra-Orthodox Jews, were shouting that the journalist, Jacob Kornbluh, was a snitch, an informer who had betrayed his own by publishing reports on how devoutly religious Jews in the city had been ignoring coronavirus guidelines. The group got all the way to Mr. Kornbluh’s doorstep, where a line of police officers kept them at bay. The tense scene spoke to what many Orthodox leaders said they had been seeing for weeks: a growing, raucous faction of young men in the community, tired of pandemic guidelines and resentful of the secular authorities, who are taking their cues from the broader right-wing movement in society, including from President Trump. For months, misinformation and rumors about the virus, some inspired by Mr. Trump, have spread widely in forums like WhatsApp that are popular with ultra-Orthodox New Yorkers, according to numerous interviews with Hasidic leaders and community members. Now, a new shutdown in Orthodox neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens, ordered last week by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, appears to have inflamed sentiments further. Mr. Cuomo closed nonessential business and schools, and limited attendance to 10 people at a time in houses of worship in the hardest hit areas, including synagogues. Mr. Cuomo was spurred by spiking caseloads in the Orthodox community and concerns that health rules were not being followed. But some Orthodox voices have responded by arguing that their community’s religious life was being targeted by the government. The Orthodox Jewish community in the New York region includes Hasidic and other ultra-Orthodox groups. There are as many as 500,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews in the New York region, and they have long tended toward conservative politics. In 2016, Hasidic neighborhoods in Brooklyn voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump. But the pandemic may have also emboldened more extreme elements, complicating efforts to curb the virus and frightening normally outspoken Hasidic activists and writers. “There is a mistrust in media, a mistrust in government, and people don’t check the facts,” Mr. Kornbluh said in an interview. “In the years since Trump came onto the scene, people are more engaged in politics, and follow Trump and his conspiracy theories.” After the virus devastated Hasidic neighborhoods in the early days of the pandemic, many residents began to believe that safety precautions were unnecessary because they had developed herd immunity, according to community leaders. That attitude, which health officials say has no basis in fact, has been a primary reason for a recent surge of cases in Brooklyn and Queens that has raised the citywide positivity rate to levels not seen in months. On the first night after the governor announced the restrictions, a group of mostly young men in the predominantly Orthodox neighborhood of Borough Park took to the streets in protest. They were led by a local radio host and viral video personality, Heshy Tischler, a Trump follower and a candidate for City Council who was once convicted of conspiracy to commit immigration fraud and sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison. Mr. Tischler identifies as Orthodox, but is not part of a Hasidic sect. Still, he has gained popularity during the pandemic, in part because he has gone after critics of the Hasidic community.
