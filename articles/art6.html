By Pranshu Verma WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Wednesday suspended or terminated three bilateral agreements with Hong Kong related to extradition and tax exemptions, the latest in a series of measures that escalate tensions between Washington and Beijing. The move comes after President Trump signed an executive order last month ending the special status that the United States granted Hong Kong in diplomatic and trade relations. The administration has sought to punish China for its attempts to stifle political dissent in the former British territory. China announced in June that it was imposing a national security law in Hong Kong to grant security agencies expansive powers, giving Beijing sweeping authority to crack down on a variety of political actions. “The Chinese Communist Party chose to crush the freedoms and autonomy of the people of Hong Kong,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter. “Because of the CCP’s actions, we are terminating or suspending three of our bilateral agreements with the territory.” The three agreements cover the transfer of fugitives and convicted prisoners. They also apply to reciprocal tax exemptions on income from international shipping, the department said. In recent months, the Trump administration has taken a series of financial, diplomatic and technological measures against China, which experts say is causing relations between the two countries to reach new lows.
