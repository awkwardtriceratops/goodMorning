By John Williams PEN America on Tuesday announced that the playwright and novelist Ayad Akhtar would serve as its next president, succeeding the novelist Jennifer Egan. Mr. Akhtar, who has been on the board of trustees for the nonprofit literary and human rights organization for five years, won the Pulitzer for his play “Disgraced” in 2013, and is publishing a highly anticipated new novel, “Homeland Elegies,” on Sept. 15. He will officially take over the president’s role at PEN America on Dec. 2. I spoke to him about the current debates around free speech and so-called cancel culture, the organization’s new branches across the country, its future priorities and more. These are edited and condensed excerpts from the conversation. There’s been a pivot toward a more domestic focus for the organization since the 2016 election. What do you think of that, and will it continue?
