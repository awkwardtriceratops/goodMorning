Biden campaign surrogates lace into Trump over playing down the virus: ‘My dad did not panic. But instead, he died.’ Trump will head to Michigan after potentially damaging revelations. A Monmouth poll shows Biden keeping his lead over Trump nationally and voters worried about election integrity. Trump’s Woodward tapes are fodder for a new ad. In encounters with Black leaders, Trump has chosen photo ops over substance. Dress code for tonight’s Michigan rally: the only acceptable campaign gear is Trump’s. ‘We all do stupid things at 17,’ Donald Trump Jr. says of the teen accused of Kenosha killings. Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign on Thursday extended its denunciations of President Trump over revelations that he knowingly minimized the risks of the coronavirus, directly blaming his response to the crisis for the loss of American lives. During a call with reporters addressing Mr. Trump’s admission to the journalist Bob Woodward that he had intentionally played down the virus, the campaign offered a stinging rebuke of the president even as it attempted to stave off questions about Mr. Biden’s own virus response. “My dad trusted the president,” said Kristin Urquiza, whose 65-year-old father died of the virus in Arizona in June, not long after the state lifted many stay-at-home restrictions. “He listened to the president and followed his advice,” she continued, echoing remarks she made at the Democratic convention last month. “And sure, my dad did not panic. But instead, he died.” Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, also on the call, said Mr. Trump’s decision to play down the virus was “the definition of Donald Trump’s phony populism.” “He sold the American people these lies, then he betrayed them and people died,” Mr. Brown said. Mr. Biden seized on the revelations Wednesday during a campaign stop in Michigan: “He knew how dangerous it was. And while this deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job on purpose. It was a life-and-death betrayal of the American people.” “It’s beyond despicable,” Mr. Biden added, detailing the crises the nation faces as a result of the pandemic that go far beyond the staggering public health costs. “It’s a dereliction of duty. It’s a disgrace.” Before the campaign call on Thursday, Mr. Trump tried to attack Mr. Biden’s own response to the virus, pointing in a memo to Mr. Biden’s early remarks on the threat and his campaign’s decision to hold an indoor rally in Michigan in early March. The memo did not mention that Mr. Trump also continued to hold rallies even after privately acknowledging the dangers of the virus, or that he held an indoor rally in Oklahoma in June, long after the severity of the virus had become abundantly clear and more than 100,000 people had died in the United States. “While President Trump was already taking decisive action to protect the country in the early months, Biden was saying barely anything about the pandemic and continuing about his campaign as normal,” said the memo, which was sent to reporters minutes before the Biden campaign’s call. Attempting to parry Mr. Trump’s attacks, Bill Russo, the deputy communications director for the Biden campaign, laid out steps Mr. Biden took as the outbreak grew, including an op-ed article Mr. Biden wrote about the dangers of the virus in January. Asked by a reporter about the campaign’s decision to hold an indoor rally in March, on the eve of the Michigan primary, Mr. Russo acknowledged that the rally may have been a mistake but tried to shift the focus back to Mr. Trump. “Maybe those are decisions that, you know, that look a little bit differently in hindsight,” Mr. Russo said. “But maybe if the president the United States hadn’t been lying about the extent of the crisis that we were facing, we would have had different information to make different decisions.” — Sydney Ember The forecast for President Trump’s scheduled campaign stop today in Freeland, Mich., is cloudy, appropriately enough. Mr. Trump, a politician who almost always generates his own weather, finds himself trapped in a self-spun tempest just as he tries to recapture the momentum that led to big victories in the battleground Midwest four years ago. He endured one of the most turbulent days of his presidency on Wednesday, with the emergence of two highly dangerous late-campaign story lines — the revelation (via the veteran presidential chronicler Bob Woodward) that he intentionally downplayed the lethality of the coronavirus and an accusation from a whistle-blower that his Homeland Security team had tried to intentionally downplay other threats — Russian interference in the 2020 election and violent white supremacy. Each story has its distinct narrative. But they both converge on a single, damning conclusion, in the view of his critics: that Mr. Trump puts his own welfare, political and personal, above the interests of the country. “I wanted to always play it down,” the president told Mr. Woodward, as the pandemic built in intensity early this year. “I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.” Later, Mr. Trump seized on the “panic” part, saying he was simply trying to marshal national morale at a fearful moment. The counterpoint: “He knew how dangerous it was,” said Mr. Trump’s opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., during his own stop on Wednesday in Michigan, a state that the president won in 2016 but where Mr. Biden now holds a modest yet stable polling advantage. “It was a life-and-death betrayal of the American people.” A few hours after the Woodward excerpts were published, word came that Brian Murphy, the former head of the Homeland Security Department’s intelligence branch, had said in a complaint that he was ordered to stop producing assessments on Russian interference. He added that the Homeland Security secretary, Chad Wolf, had ordered him not to disseminate a report on a Russian disinformation campaign to denigrate Mr. Biden’s mental health because it “made the president look bad.” Mr. Trump’s appearance in Michigan will take place at the M.B.S. International Airport outside Saginaw. As president, Mr. Trump has shown a preference for staging events at airplane hangars — they are weatherproof, don’t expose him to heckling crowds and, above all, they allow him to get in and out quickly. He likes to do the same with news cycles. Will the stories linger, or be swept away in the amnesia winds of Trump-era politics? Mr. Trump is banking on the latter. By Wednesday night, he was furiously working to change the subject, unveiling his list of second-term Supreme Court finalists, celebrating the life of the baseball great Roberto Clemente (the Puerto Rican vote is critical in Florida’s I-10 corridor) and announcing on Twitter that the Navy would “NOT” be canceling its contract with Catholic chaplains. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan laced into Mr. Trump Thursday as he prepared to travel to her state. “His failure to act has cost so many lives and sent our economy in a tailspin,” she said during her weekly briefing on the coronavirus. “It’s just devastating to hear that. The biggest threat to the American people is the American president right now.” — Glenn Thrush and Kathleen Gray A national poll released Thursday shows Joseph R. Biden Jr. maintaining his lead over President Trump as the campaign enters the its last two months, adding to a growing number of surveys that have suggested that the state of the race is largely unchanged since the party conventions. The poll, conducted by Monmouth University, shows Mr. Biden ahead of Mr. Trump by nine percentage points among registered voters, 51 percent to 42 percent. The survey results are almost identical to those in a survey conducted by Monmouth in early August, before the conventions. Thursday’s poll also found Mr. Biden with a seven-point lead among likely voters, which tracks with national polling averages at this stage in the race. On average, Mr. Biden has been holding onto a lead of seven to eight percentage points among likely voters nationwide, down slightly from a lead of eight to nine points heading into the conventions. The Monmouth survey also found only two percent of likely voters undecided. The poll was conducted by telephone from Sept. 3 to 8, surveyed 758 registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. National polls can provide a broad window into the state of the race, but it is Electoral College votes that decide the outcome. Some recent polls have shown Mr. Biden’s lead slipping in battleground states like Florida and Pennsylvania. The Monmouth poll also asked voters about their confidence in the integrity of the 2020 election. Mr. Trump has railed for weeks against mail voting, which is expected to be used by tens of millions of voters amid the coronavirus pandemic, claiming without evidence that the practice is rife with fraud. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have said that the Russian group that interfered in the 2016 presidential election is meddling again. Thursday’s survey found only about six in 10 voters very or somewhat confident that the election will be conducted fairly. Roughly one in four said they were “not too confident” and 13 percent said they were “not at all confident.” The poll found that 52 percent of voters thought it somewhat or very likely that the Trump campaign would try to cheat if it was necessary to win; 39 percent of respondents said the same about the Biden campaign. — Matt Stevens AD WATCH The newly-released recordings of President Trump admitting in interviews with Bob Woodward that he downplayed the threat of the coronavirus are prime fodder for Democratic attacks. Priorities USA, a major Democratic super PAC, was the first to cut them into a digital ad. Since the pandemic exploded in late March, Democratic groups and candidates have seized on the coronavirus as a top political advertising issue, and nearly $40 million in TV ads over the past 30 days have focused on Covid-19, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. Many Democratic attacks have followed the same formula as the new ad from Priorities USA: audio of Mr. Trump downplaying the virus set against an exponential growth chart of deaths. But the new ad set against the same graphics, using recordings from Mr. Woodward’s interviews with the president, drives home a darker message: that rather than handling the virus incompetently, Mr. Trump engaged in a cover-up, hiding information about how lethal the pandemic was from the American people. The ad begins with audio clips of Mr. Trump’s interview with Mr. Woodward, but transitions to public comments Mr. Trump has made, splicing together a clip of him saying “the coronavirus” with one saying “this is their new hoax.” The Trump campaign has taken issue with this edit before, claiming it distorts what the president said. His full comments, following an accusation that the Democrats were “politicizing” the coronavirus, were: “They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.” The ad will run in both English and Spanish in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Arizona. Priorities USA said it will run in other battleground states as well, but did not specify which. Voters across the country have been inundated with ads replaying Mr. Trump’s comments downplaying the virus earlier this year, both as the screens show them rising death counts and their everyday lives continue to be upended by the pandemic. But Priorities USA, and likely other groups in the near future, are betting that newly revealed comments from Mr. Trump indicating he was intentionally downplaying the virus and hiding its true danger from voters will have a greater impact. — Nick Corasaniti Protests against racial injustice and the widespread impact of the coronavirus are helping to drive young Latinos to vote this year, according to a new national survey of Latino voters between the ages 18 and 34. Roughly 56 percent of young Latino voters surveyed by the poll, which was conducted by Telemundo and BuzzFeed News, said they had participated in Black Lives Matter and racial equality protests, either by attending demonstrations or participating in boycotts, and roughly 85 percent said that addressing inequality and systemic racism motivates them to vote in the November election. Nearly three in four young Latino voters said they, their family or friends have been the target of racism over the past two years. The survey also showed some signs of political disillusionment. When asked to name politicians who “show up” for Latinos, one third of those surveyed answered “nobody.” Senator Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were each named by 6 percent of Latinos surveyed, and three percent named President Trump. Some 37 percent of young Latinos describe themselves as independent or undecided about their political party affiliation, while half called themselves Democrats and 13 percent identify as Republican. Half of all respondents said their political affiliation differed from their parents’. The poll found a low level of excitement about the candidates, but that 60 percent of young Latinos said that they would vote for Mr. Biden in the election were held tomorrow, and 19 percent for Mr. Trump. Roughly 83 percent of those surveyed said the coronavirus pandemic had affected their health and finances and nearly half said they had suffered financially because of job losses or pay cuts. Three-quarters of voters described the 2020 presidential election as more important than the 2016 vote. The online survey conducted in June and released Thursday included responses from 638 people who identified as Latino and 685 non-Latinos between the ages of 18 and 34. — Jennifer Medina President Trump likes to make the far-fetched claim that he has done more for Black Americans than any president since Abraham Lincoln. But many Black leaders who have tried to work with him tell a different story — that he is more interested in photo ops than substantive interactions. Often the president has turned opportunities for reconciliation, or even to debate policy differences, into empty-calorie encounters in front of the cameras, according to interviews with more than 30 Black officials, civil rights leaders, and former and current administration officials. The pattern, they said, established itself even before he took office. On Martin Luther King’s Birthday in January 2017, President-elect Trump welcomed civil rights leaders, led by Dr. King’s eldest son, to Trump Tower to discuss a proposal intended to prevent state voter identification laws from disenfranchising people of color. The delegation had low expectations, and even those were quickly dashed: “Many people didn’t go out — many Blacks didn’t go out — to vote for Hillary because they liked me. That was almost as good as getting their vote,” Mr. Trump said, lowering his voice to say the word “Blacks,” on a recording provided by a meeting participant and confirmed as authentic by three others. As the 2020 campaign heads toward the homestretch, Mr. Trump is embracing the same split-screen approach he has used for years: He talks up friendships with Black Americans — and at last month’s Republican convention, featured glowing testimonies from Black supporters — while running a campaign that tries to frighten white suburban voters into thinking a Biden presidency will bring problems from inner-city America to their front lawns. The manifestation of this strategy is the photo op. Mr. Trump is so well known for attempting to draw Black officials into the frame with him that members of the Congressional Black Caucus who met with him at the White House in 2017 kept away from his favorite snapshot spot, the Resolute Desk. “I know his type,” said Representative James Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, who was in the room. “He has been as caustic as he can be. Trump insults in public and then makes a private phone call to you to say that is really not what he meant. I have been around those kind of white people all my life.” — Glenn Thrush A clear majority of American adults worry that political pressure from the Trump administration will lead the Food and Drug Administration to rush through a coronavirus vaccine without making sure it is safe and effective, according to a poll released Thursday by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The poll, conducted between Aug. 28 and Sept. 3, found 62 percent of adults concerned about political pressure on the F.D.A. to approve a vaccine, Democrats far more so than Republicans. Mr. Trump, hoping to shore up flagging opinion of his handling of the virus, has said as recently as this week that a vaccine might be available by Election Day, a prospect many government medical leaders — including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci; the director of the National Institutes of Health; and the chief adviser for the White House vaccine program — consider quite unlikely. Nevertheless, the poll, which tracks public attitudes about a range of issues, found that six months into the pandemic, more Americans are feeling that it has passed its peak. Thirty-eight percent said “the worst is yet to come,” down from 74 in early April. Another 38 percent say “the worst is behind us,” up from 13 percent in April. The poll, a nationally representative random sample of 1,199 adults, has a margin of error of plus or minus three percent. — Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Andy Newman Should Bob Woodward have withheld until now a February quotation from President Trump, who privately told him the coronavirus was “deadly stuff” even as he publicly minimized its severity? Could Mr. Woodward have helped save lives by releasing the information sooner? The revelation of Mr. Trump’s characterization of the virus came Wednesday in reports about Mr. Woodward’s new book, “Rage,” due out next week, for which Mr. Trump spoke to Mr. Woodward extensively. It prompted a larger debate around journalistic ethics, with some arguing that Mr. Woodward, a lion of American journalism, had an obligation to report Mr. Trump’s assessment sooner. Many observers argued that the public had a right not only to the information about the deadly potential of the virus early on, but also to the fact that Mr. Trump had been told the truth by experts and yet continued to mislead Americans. An often cited example is his comments in March comparing the coronavirus favorably to the seasonal flu. “Trump was the key vector of harmful misinformation,” Marc Ambinder, a former White House correspondent for National Journal, wrote on Twitter. “We KNOW that his supporters BELIEVE HIM and altered their behavior because they thought COVID would be less harmful then the flu … cause that’s what Trump said.” He added, “I’m inclined to say that holding onto this is and was flat out wrong.” The president himself weighed in — on Mr. Woodward’s side, sort of — in a tweet on Thursday. “Bob Woodward had my quotes for many months,” the president noted. “If he thought they were so bad or dangerous, why didn’t he immediately report them in an effort to save lives? Didn’t he have an obligation to do so? No, because he knew they were good and proper answers. Calm, no panic!” Others doubted that revealing Mr. Trump’s comments sooner would have made a difference. “If you believe that Woodward publishing Trump’s quote in March would’ve changed anything on Coronavirus the last four years have taught you absolutely nothing,” said James Ball, the global editor of The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, on Twitter. Mr. Woodward did not reply to requests for comment Wednesday evening. While it is common for journalists and book authors to agree to hold back information or comments from sources until an agreed-upon date, Mr. Woodward told Margaret Sullivan, The Post’s media columnist, that there was no such deal in place. Rather, he said, he declined to share the comment in February or March because he did not learn until May that it had come from an intelligence briefing. By then, he told The Associated Press on Wednesday, the quote’s significance pertained to politics rather than public health, and the relevant deadline was the November election. — Marc Tracy and Glenn Thrush Trump supporters heading to the president’s rally in Freeland, Mich., Thursday night were given some unusual notes on how to prepare. “The suggested attire is casual,” according to an email from the Trump campaign to people who registered online for tickets to the event. “Official Trump Campaign merchandise is permitted. Please do not wear ANY OTHER campaign merchandise (i.e. local, state, or federal campaigns).” The guidelines were unusual, according to Democratic and Republican strategists who have worked on other national campaigns. All presidential campaign managers experience friction with local candidates and lawmakers who want speaking slots ahead of a national candidate coming to town. But campaign strategists said it was strange to prohibit signs or T-shirts supporting down-ballot candidates that the leader of the party is supposed to help elevate — and doubly odd to put the directive in writing, they said. Tim Miller, who worked for former Jeb Bush’s Republican presidential campaign in 2016, called the dress code “cultish.” Mr. Trump may often brag about the power of his endorsement to help other candidates win local races, but the dress code indicates the extent of his aversion to seeing the spotlight on anyone but him. Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign communications director, said that only approved Trump-branded signage or apparel was permitted at campaign events. “It’s the President’s campaign,” he said, by way of explanation. Other campaign aides said the dress code was designed to give the crowd a consistent look and branding across the board. “The President enjoys enthusiastic support at his events of the kind Joe Biden can only dream of,” Mr. Murtaugh added. — Annie Karni Donald Trump Jr. told an interviewer this week that his father was reserving judgment on Kyle H. Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old Illinois resident accused of killing two protesters in Kenosha, Wis. last month — and suggested the shootings were the actions of an impetuous “young kid.” The interviewer, the former “Bachelorette” contestant Rachel Lindsay, asked the younger Trump why his father had not condemned Mr. Rittenhouse. “We’re waiting for due process. We’re not jumping to a conclusion,” Mr. Trump, who was promoting his new book, “Liberal Privilege,” said on the “Extra” entertainment show. Then he mused: “If I put myself in Kyle Rittenhouse, maybe I shouldn’t have been there — he’s a young kid, I don’t want 17-year-olds running around the street with AR-15s — maybe I wouldn’t have put myself in that situation, who knows? But we all do stupid things at 17 — ” “That’s a little bit beyond stupid,” Ms. Lindsay interjected. “Really stupid, fine,” Mr. Trump continued. “But we all have to let that process play out.” Mr. Rittenhouse, a Trump supporter who attended one of Mr. Trump’s rallies in January, faces charges including first-degree intentional homicide in connection with the deaths of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, who were protesting the shooting of Jacob Blake. Ms. Lindsay also asked Mr. Trump about the Black Lives Matter movement. “It’s a very good marketing message, it’s a great catchphrase,” said Mr. Trump, adding that he agreed with the movement’s broad goals, but not its underlying ideology. — Glenn Thrush President Trump heads to Michigan after a day of potentially damaging revelations from Bob Woodward’s forthcoming book. Joe Biden seized on the news.
