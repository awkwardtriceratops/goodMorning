Biden and Trump Converge on Tampa<br></h1><p id="artcont">Jon Ossoff calls Perdue ‘a crook’ over stock purchases during a bitter Senate debate in Georgia.  As the candidates cross paths in Tampa, starkly different approaches to the virus take center stage. Trailing in Pennsylvania, the Trump camp tries to make it harder to cast a vote. Poll roundup: Biden’s numbers stay strong, as an NBC/Marist survey finds him ahead in Florida. Supreme Court allows longer absentee ballot deadlines in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Today’s economic report shows a record-setting rebound. But the numbers are misleading. What Trump’s disrespectful treatment of Martha McSally says about his own struggles. Has Texas finally become a true presidential battleground state? President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. have waged two very different campaigns during the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Trump has plowed ahead with his aggressive schedule of signature rallies packed with thousands of supporters, while Mr. Biden has proceeded with his socially distanced drive-in gatherings, public health briefings and speeches on unifying the nation. The two have rarely crossed paths, besides the two debate stages. But Mr. Trump has added a Thursday trip to his itinerary in Tampa, Fla. — where Mr. Biden will also appear later in the day — to hold a rally outside a football stadium. For a president lagging in the polls, any chance to sharpen a contrast with his rival with only a few days left in the campaign is a welcome opportunity. And Mr. Trump relishes and values the largely maskless crowds he draws by the thousands. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump posted a video contrasting Mr. Biden’s arrival to a speech in Georgia, where the Democratic nominee appeared before a small group of attendees distanced and demarcated by white circles, with his own arrival in a military helicopter above a large, cheering crowd. In his speeches, the president uses the size of his crowds as evidence that he can’t possibly be losing. The irony is that the same contrast — Mr. Biden’s adhering to public health guidelines while Mr. Trump flouts them — is exactly the message that the former vice president and his Delaware-centered campaign want to send to voters. Poll after poll shows Mr. Biden more trusted than Mr. Trump to handle the pandemic, just as cases are on the rise and the stock market suffered its worst day in months. Guy Cecil, the chairman of the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, said that Mr. Trump’s insistence on holding mass gatherings was “actually hurting himself.” “He is making a difference,” Mr. Cecil said. “He is making people less favorable and less open to voting for him.” For Mr. Trump, holding a rally in Tampa amounts to coming full circle. An event there in March, just as the virus was shutting down large parts of the country, was one of the first that he was reluctantly forced to cancel. “We have over 100,000 requests for tickets, but I think we’ll probably not do it because people would say it’s better to not do,” Mr. Trump said at the time during a bilateral meeting with the prime minister of Ireland. “You know, we need a little separation until such time as this goes away. It’s going to go away. It’s going to go away.” The president turned to someone for consultation. “What is the number as of this morning?” he asked. “Is it 32? You could tell me. Is it 32 deaths?” It was. On Wednesday, The New York Times’s coronavirus tracker showed that the country had reported 227,667 deaths. — Shane Goldmacher President Trump’s campaign is pursuing a three-pronged strategy in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania that would effectively suppress mail-in votes there, moving to stop the processing of absentee votes before Election Day, pushing to limit how late mail-in ballots can be accepted and intimidating Pennsylvanians trying to vote early. The state is one of a handful that by law prevent mail-in votes from counted until Election Day. In Pennsylvania and other swing states, these ballots are expected to skew heavily toward Democrats. In an effort to accommodate a pandemic-driven avalanche of absentee ballots, Pennsylvania, like many other states, has tried to relax some rules, like the one that requires all votes to be counted within six days after Election Day, by extending the period to nine days. But the Trump campaign has leaned on Republican allies in the legislature to prevent any changes. Among many other lawsuits, the campaign has mounted litigation in state, local and federal courts to curtail how late mail-in votes can be accepted and to challenge other rules and procedures. On Wednesday evening, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a fast-tracked plea from Pennsylvania Republicans to block the three-day extension of the deadline for receiving absentee ballots in the state. The Trump campaign has also dispatched its officials to early voting sites, videotaped voters and even pressed election administrators in the Philadelphia area to stop people from delivering more than one ballot to a drop box. The intensity of the Trump campaign’s efforts in Philadelphia stems in part from the man running its Election Day operations nationwide: Michael Roman, a native Philadelphian who cut his teeth in city politics before running a domestic intelligence-gathering operation for the conservative Koch brothers. Like his boss, Mr. Roman has persistently made public statements undermining confidence in the electoral process. Neither Mr. Roman nor the campaign would comment for this article. Some residents have been left bewildered by the Trump campaign’s attention this year. During the primary election over the summer, Adam S. Goodman, an insurance lawyer, posted a photo on Instagram in which he proudly held up two mail-in ballots outside a drop box. He learned the Trump campaign had used the photo in litigation against the city to illustrate an accusation that some voters were dropping off more than one ballot. But Mr. Goodman said his husband was simply standing out of the frame when the picture was taken. The president, who was in the state Monday, had ominous words for voters there. “A lot of strange things happening in Philadelphia,” he said during a stop in Allentown. “We’re watching you, Philadelphia. We’re watching at the highest level.” Law enforcement officials, at least in Philadelphia, were unbowed by the president’s threats. “Keep your Proud Boys, goon squads and uncertified ‘poll watchers’ out of our city, Mr. President,” Lawrence S. Krasner, the city’s district attorney, said. “Break the law here, and I’ve got something for you.” — Nick Corasaniti and Danny Hakim A trove of polls conducted mostly or entirely after the final presidential debate — which the Trump campaign had hoped would turn around the president’s sagging numbers — landed on Wednesday, and they offered little in the way of encouragement for President Trump. The closest thing to a state poll that qualified as good news was an Ipsos poll showing him down only a point in Arizona. Otherwise, there was little evidence the race was tightening, with five days left before the election — and, crucially, with nearly 80 million Americans already having cast their votes.  An NBC/Marist poll of Florida released this morning did not show Mr. Trump’s prospects brightening in the Sunshine State either. It found Joseph R. Biden Jr. holding a four-point edge over the president among likely voters, with only two percent of respondents saying they were undecided. Mr. Biden’s lead is within the poll’s margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. But it is also in line with polls that have consistently found Mr. Biden slightly ahead of the president in a win-or-die state Mr. Trump carried in 2016. And it represents a gain for Mr. Biden over an NBC/Marist Florida poll conducted in September after the party conventions that had found the candidates tied. Mr. Biden, NBC/Marist found, has opened up a lead over Mr. Trump in Florida among the state’s vast population of older voters — in September, the candidates were essentially tied. Now Mr. Biden is ahead among older voters by seven points. Mr. Biden’s advantage over the president among independent voters there has also edged up, to 14 points from 11, while Mr. Trump continues hold advantages among Florida’s Latino voters (by six percentage points), white voters (seven points), men (10 points) and whites without college degrees (26 points). The poll was conducted from Oct. 25 to Oct. 27, after the Oct. 22 debate. If anything had poll junkies talking yesterday, it was the conflicting results in Wisconsin. ABC News/Washington Post, a high-quality pollster, found Mr. Biden leading by an eyebrow-raising 17 points. Marquette University Law School, perhaps the most trusted pollster in the state, found him leading by five points. It is hard to explain the discrepancy. Wisconsin is a difficult state to poll. It has no party registration and no large racial divide, so it’s not the kind of place where making sure you have the right number of white and Black voters is tantamount to having the right number of Ds and Rs. But these two pollsters, and their polls, are actually quite similar and used the same basic methods.  This suggests that the difference could be just statistical noise: the kind of weird, outlying results you inevitably get with random sampling National polls released by major pollsters yesterday also had positive news for Mr. Biden. YouGov/Economist had him up by 11 points, ticking up from its pre-debate poll. CNN/SSRS had him up by 12, a fine result for him even if it’s a pollster that has put up some particularly strong results for him before. — Nate Cohn and Andy Newman A $265 million Trump administration campaign to “defeat despair” about the coronavirus was planned partly around the politically tinged theme that “helping the president will help the country,” according to documents released on Thursday by House investigators. Administration officials envisioned a star-studded campaign to lift American spirits, but the lawmakers said they sought to exclude celebrities who had supported gay rights or same-sex marriage or who had not favored President Trump. Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee and the select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis released the records, declaring that “these documents include extremely troubling revelations.” They accused Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, of “a cover-up to conceal the Trump administration’s misuse of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars for partisan political purposes ahead of the upcoming election.” The public relations effort — led in part by Michael R. Caputo, the former Health and Human Services official who went on medical leave after posting a rant on Facebook claiming that career government scientists were committing “sedition” to undermine the president — is now in shambles. Celebrities picked to promote the campaign, including the actor Dennis Quaid, have pulled out. Mr. Azar ordered a review of whether the initiative served “important public health purposes.” The new documents deal with a $15 million contract awarded to Atlas Research and indicate that government officials successfully urged the company to hire three little-known subcontractors with no obvious expertise to join the bigger campaign. When Mark H. Chichester, the president of Atlas, tried to research those subcontractors, he discovered “small shops with little on them in the public domain,” according to documents the committee released. One was a one-person operation run by a state-level Republican pollster, Mr. Chichester wrote. Another appeared to be “a small — perhaps one-man” operation. A third was a  owned by a Russian-born business associate of Caputo’s, Mr. Chichester said. In a September meeting with one subcontractor, Mr. Caputo suggested “taglines” for the effort, some of which had a distinctly partisan tone, according to notes released by the lawmakers. Mr. Caputo, a staunch Trump ally, said that theme “would appeal to his base in terms of wearing a mask, vaccine,” the notes state. — Noah Weiland and Sharon LaFraniere In a pair of decisions welcomed by Democrats, the Supreme Court on Wednesday at least temporarily let election officials in two key battleground states, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, accept absentee ballots for several days after Election Day. In the Pennsylvania case, the court refused a plea from Pennsylvania Republicans that it decide before Election Day whether the state can continue counting absentee ballots for three days after Nov. 3. In the North Carolina case, the court let stand a lower court ruling that allowed the state’s board of elections to extend the deadline to nine days after Election Day, up from the three days called for by state legislators. The court’s brief orders in the two cases were unsigned and gave no reasons. The two cases involved broadly similar issues. In Pennsylvania, the question was whether the state’s Supreme Court could override voting rules set by the state legislature. In North Carolina, the question was whether state election officials had the power to alter such voting rules. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the court on Tuesday, did not take part in either case. A court spokeswoman said Justice Barrett said she had not participated “because of the need for a prompt resolution of it and because she has not had time to fully review the parties’ filings.” — Adam Liptak U.S. economic output grew at the fastest pace on record last quarter as businesses began to reopen and customers returned to stores. But the economy has climbed only partway out of its pandemic-induced hole, and progress is slowing. Gross domestic product — the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the United States — grew 7.4 percent in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday — the biggest single-quarter gain since reliable statistics began after World War II. Even before the release, President Trump touted the prospect of a big gain as evidence that the economy had roared back to life after the spring’s pandemic-induced shutdowns. For most of the campaign, one of the few bright spots in polling for Mr. Trump was that Americans thought he would do a better job than Joseph R. Biden Jr. steering the economy for the next four years, though that advantage has largely evaporated.  The stock market has fallen this week as the pandemic explodes anew, so the president is keen to have something to boast about. But economists said the third-quarter figures revealed less about the strength of the recovery than about the severity of the collapse that preceded it. G.D.P. fell 10 percent over the first two quarters as the pandemic hit. A big rebound was inevitable once the economy began to reopen. The challenge is what comes next. “The reason we had such a big bounce is that the economy went from closed to partially open,” said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America. “The easy growth was exhausted, and now the hard work has to be done in terms of fully healing.” Moreover, monthly data indicates that progress slowed over the course of the third quarter, a slowdown most economists expect to worsen in the final three months of the year as virus cases rise and federal aid to households and businesses fades. “It looks like economic momentum is fading in the fourth quarter,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist for TD Securities. The weekly report on new unemployment claims was also released this morning. It showed a slight decrease from last week, another sign that the economic recovery remains fragile. — Ben Casselman Jon Ossoff, the Democratic nominee in one of Georgia’s two Senate races, slammed Senator David Perdue, his Republican opponent, as “a crook” on Wednesday night and accused him of trying to profit from the coronavirus pandemic The remark came during a bruising debate that underscored the bitter partisan divide in what was once a safely Republican state. Mr. Perdue, 70, said he had done nothing wrong, and accused Mr. Ossoff, 33, of pursuing a “radical socialist agenda” that would result in higher taxes. Mr. Perdue, a wealthy former corporate executive, bought stock in DuPont de Nemours, which sells personal protective equipment, on Jan. 24, the same day he received a classified briefing on the threat posed by the coronavirus, according to a report in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “It’s not just that you’re a crook, Senator,” Mr. Ossoff said, turning to face his socially-distanced opponent as Mr. Perdue’s eyes remained fixed on the camera. “It’s that you’re attacking the health of the people that you represent. You did say Covid-19 was no deadlier than the flu. You did say there would be no significant uptick in cases. All the while you were looking after your own assets and your own portfolio.” Mr. Perdue has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and said any transactions he made were executed by a financial adviser without his knowledge. “The thing I’m most upset about,” Mr. Perdue said of Mr. Ossoff, “is that he’ll say and do anything to my friends in Georgia to mislead them about how radical and socialist” his agenda is. Recent polls have found Mr. Perdue in a dead heat with Mr. Ossoff. If neither candidate hits 50 percent of the vote, they will face a runoff election in January. — Glenn Thrush President Trump’s dismissive and disrespectful treatment of his nominal political ally Senator Martha McSally in Arizona on Wednesday was cast by local media as a humiliating coda to her difficult campaign. But it said just as much about Mr. Trump’s own stumble down the stretch, exacerbated by an unwillingness to take even the most basic steps to improve his shaky standing among women voters. All Mr. Trump had to do in Goodyear, Ariz., was introduce Ms. McSally, a fellow Republican, and smile when she offered a unity pitch. No go. After starting by saying she was “respected by everybody,” he instantly proved that she was not. “Martha, come up just fast! Fast! Fast! Come on. Quick! You got one minute!” he shouted, as some, but not all, in the crowd laughed. “One minute, Martha! They don’t want to hear this, Martha. Come on. Let’s go. Quick, quick, quick, quick. Come on. Let’s go.” Ms. McSally ran on the stage, elbow-bumped the president, and professed herself “proud” of him, after declining to do so at a debate earlier this month. This might have been the reason he was so eager to see her come and go. (Ms. McSally wrote in an op-ed this week that she was supporting Mr. Trump’s re-election.) Ms. McSally, a former fighter pilot appointed to her current seat, trails her Democratic opponent, Mark Kelly, in polls, and she is underperforming Mr. Trump in Arizona. But Mr. Trump is also underperforming his 2016 self in a state he won by 3.5 points four years ago. A big part of the reason, in the Sun Belt and elsewhere, is the defection of white suburban women, who have been driven away by a number of factors, particularly his failure to manage the coronavirus pandemic and the way that he speaks about women. He did little to address either vulnerability on Wednesday. “Biden and the Democrat socialists will delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, shutter your schools and shut down our country,” Trump told the audience, tightly packed and intermittently masked. “And your state is open right? Your state is nice and open.” Then came the McSally moment. The clip, which dominated local news coverage and social media, provided a brutal visual representation of Mr. Trump’s core political problem. Here he was physically rushing a suburban woman off the stage, and placing a strict time limit on her opportunity to speak — a limit he has never imposed on himself. What happened next underscored the slight even more vividly. After Ms. McSally spoke, Mr. Trump invited three male out-of-state supporters — Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky,  Representative Kevin McCarthy of California and Senator Mike Lee of Utah — onstage for unrushed appearances that focused on their adulation of him. — Glenn Thrush As coronavirus cases and deaths were rising in the United States last spring, Jared Kushner, President Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, told an interviewer that the president had taken the “country back from the doctors.” The comment was made on April 18 in a discussion with the journalist Bob Woodward as he was reporting for his book, “Rage,” his second about the Trump presidency. CNN obtained an audio recording of the interview. Even as the country was falling into the grip of a pandemic that to date has claimed more than 220,000 American lives, Mr. Kushner told Mr. Woodward that his father-in-law had won a battle for control with the doctors struggling to understand how to combat the little-known virus. Mr. Kushner sounded decidedly optimistic — even triumphant. “There were three phases,” he said. “There’s the panic phase, the pain phase and then the comeback phase. I do believe that last night symbolized kind of the beginning of the comeback phase. That doesn’t mean there’s not still a lot of pain and there won’t be pain for a while, but that basically was: We’ve now put out rules to get back to work. Trump’s now back in charge. It’s not the doctors. They’ve kind of — we have, like, a negotiated settlement.” At the time, Mr. Trump was laser-focused on what the pandemic would mean for his presidency, and his re-election prospects, and was trying to convince the public that restrictions several states had imposed were excessive. Mr. Kushner had several conversations with Mr. Woodward that White House officials have said he believed were on background, and not for quoting. A White House spokeswoman, Sarah Matthews, defended Mr. Trump’s approach. “As he has said numerous times, the cure cannot be worse than the disease,” she said. “When it was in the best interest of the country to shut down, he did so at the advice of top health officials. However, as president, he must take a holistic approach to the virus and consider the devastating effects of lockdowns and the consequences of keeping our economy shut down for an extended period of time. ” — Maggie Haberman When Senator Ted Cruz of Texas spoke with President Trump on the phone last week, he congratulated him on his debate performance, nudged him to keep driving policy-oriented attacks against his opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., and relayed one more message. “We have a fight” in Texas, Mr. Cruz said he told Mr. Trump, warning him that the country’s second-largest electoral prize was in play and that he should take it seriously. In an interview, Mr. Cruz said he expected the president to win here — but that he also saw the same surging liberal energy in his state that had propelled Beto O’Rourke to a closer-than-expected defeat against him two years ago. “There’s no doubt that it’s a real race,” said the senator, echoing a similar case Mr. O’Rourke made to Mr. Biden earlier this month in their own phone conversation. But it’s not clear if Mr. Trump or Mr. Biden fully believe it. They may be on opposite sides of the partisan divide, but Texas Republicans and Democrats alike believe the long-awaited moment has arrived: The state is a true presidential battleground, and either candidate could prevail next week. Although a Democrat has not carried Texas since 1976, recent public and private polls suggest a highly competitive race, with some surveys showing Mr. Biden up narrowly and others showing Mr. Trump enjoying a small lead. Yet even as leading figures in both parties urge their respective presidential nominees to take Texas seriously, the campaigns are still reluctant to spend precious remaining time and money there. Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Biden is expected to appear in the state before the election. Though the state isn’t essential to a Biden victory, Democrats have been more aggressive in the state. Mr. Biden is dispatching his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, to Texas on Friday, and Democrats have also planned a multicity bus tour across the state. A Biden win would doom Mr. Trump’s chances for re-election. More significantly, it would herald the arrival of a formidable multiracial Democratic coalition in the country’s largest red state. That would hand the Democrats an electoral upper hand nationwide and all but block Republicans from the White House until they improve their fortunes with college-educated white voters, younger people and minorities. — Jonathan Martin Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, clashed on Wednesday with Sara Gideon, her Democratic opponent and the speaker of the state house, in the final debate of the race. The two women battled over the handling of the pandemic and how to provide health care to thousands of voters, and they traded accusations over negative ads and attached each other’s records. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report has rated the Maine Senate race a tossup, but several polls — including a New York Times/Siena College poll released in September — have found Ms. Collins, who is seeking a fifth term, trailing Ms. Gideon. Ms. Collins is facing the toughest re-election contest of her career, in part because her decisive vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in 2018 infuriated moderate voters who had previously supported her. On Wednesday, she defended both her vote to confirm Justice Kavanaugh and her decision to vote against the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett earlier this week, voicing skepticism that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case establishing a woman’s right to obtain an abortion. “I do not think that the Supreme Court is going to strike down Roe v. Wade,” Ms. Collins said, arguing that it has been established as a precedent that people have long relied on. Pressed on whether her vote to confirm Justice Kavanaugh reflected the will of Maine voters, Ms. Collins said “I didn’t take a poll.” Ms. Collins highlighted her work in approving nearly $3 trillion in legislation earlier this year and accused Ms. Gideon, as she has in the past, of failing to provide for Maine during the pandemic. (The Maine State House adjourned in March and has not yet returned.) “I’ll hold our record in the State Legislature up to the record of Senator Collins and the G.O.P. Senate any day,” Ms. Gideon shot back, pointing out that Congress has failed to reach an agreement on another relief package. Ms. Gideon, for her part, sought to frame the race as a referendum on the national leadership in Washington, repeatedly tying Ms. Collins to both Mr. Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, characterizations Ms. Collins dismissed. And like other Democratic candidates, Ms. Gideon argued that she would do a better job of protecting health care for voters, particularly given that the Supreme Court is set to hear a case in the coming days that could overturn the Affordable Care Act. “I will not stop fighting until we have health care that is affordable and accessible to everyone,” Ms. Gideon said. “This is why I am running for the Senate today, and this is what we have to see through.” — Emily Cochrane Election officials and cybersecurity experts are keeping a close eye on the ways hackers and foreign governments might interfere, and so far they have uncovered some attempts. In Georgia, a database that verifies voter signatures was locked up by Russian hackers in a ransomware attack that also dumped voters’ registration data online. In California and Indiana, Russia’s most formidable state hackers, a unit linked to the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., bored into local networks and hit some election systems, though it is still unclear why. In Louisiana, the National Guard was called in to stop cyberattacks that targeted small government offices and that employed tools previously seen only in attacks by North Korea. And on Tuesday night, someone hacked the Trump campaign website, defacing it with a threat in broken English that there would be more to come. Although none of these incidents amounted to much, experts, from the sprawling war room at the U.S. Cyber Command to monitors at Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft, are on alert for more “perception hacks,” smaller attacks that can be easily exaggerated into something bigger. Christopher Krebs, the Department of Homeland Security official responsible for voting system security, is worried less about a vast attack than about a series of smaller ones, perhaps in swing states, whose effect is more psychological than real. One theory inside American intelligence agencies is that Russians, having made the point that it retains access to key American systems despite bolstered defenses, may wait until it’s clear whether the vote is close. The Russian play, under this theory, would be to fan the flames of state-by-state election battles, generating or amplifying claims of fraud that would further undermine American confidence in the integrity of the election process. — David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth Voters and poll workers in Texas will be required to wear masks at election precincts after a federal judge blocked the governor, a Republican, from exempting them. The case is one of several related to voting that are testing the boundaries of public health orders as the number of infections surge in a majority of states, part of the latest wave of the coronavirus in the United States. Judge Jason Pulliam of the U.S. District Court in San Antonio ruled on Tuesday that the polling place exemption, carved out of a July 2 statewide emergency order by Gov. Greg Abbott requiring masks in public, “creates a discriminatory burden on Black and Latino voters.” The judge granted a preliminary injunction to the N.A.A.C.P. and Mi Familia Vota, a national Latino organization, which had asserted in a lawsuit that Black and Hispanic voters face a much higher risk of contracting the virus and developing complications from it than white residents. “As a result, Plaintiffs argue Black and Latino voters in Texas are forced to make an unacceptable choice with respect to the 2020 election: exercising their right to vote — or — protecting their own health and lives and that of their loved ones and community by staying home,” Judge Pulliam wrote. The state immediately filed a notice of appeal, which would be heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans. Mr. Abbott has said that he did not want to deny anyone the right to vote if they did not have a mask. The clash over masks and voting is playing out elsewhere. In Maryland, a Harford County man was arrested on charges of violating a state emergency order and trespassing after he refused to put on a mask at an early-voting precinct on Monday, the county’s sheriff said in a Facebook post on Tuesday. In Wisconsin, a poll worker in La Crosse sued the state’s governor, a Democrat,  and the city clerk last month after he said that he had been stopped from working during the state’s partisan primary in August because he would not wear a mask. The man said he had a medical condition that exempted him from the state’s mask order. In a July 31 memo, the Wisconsin Elections Commission wrote that cities and towns could not require voters to wear face coverings, even though masks  were recommended. In Kansas, the secretary of state, Scott Schwab, a Republican, reminded local elections officials earlier this month that they could not turn voters away from the polls for not wearing masks. “Exercising one’s fundamental right to vote is not, and should not be, contingent upon whether or not they choose to wear a mask,” Mr. Schwab said. — Neil Vigdor Two conservative operatives, Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, who have been charged in Ohio and Michigan with election fraud for sending out tens of thousands of robocalls intended to deter people from voting, have been ordered by a federal judge to call those voters back and inform them that the original call “contained false information.” U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero, in the Southern District of New York, said in his ruling on Wednesday that the initial robocall sent in August to 85,000 people, “cannot be described as anything but deliberate interference with voters’ rights to cast their ballots in any legal manner they choose.” Mr. Wohl, 22, and Mr. Burkman, 54, both of Arlington, Va., were charged last month in Michigan and indicted by a grand jury in Ohio this week, with sending deceptive robocalls to 85,000 people, mostly in minority communities, that stated authorities would use the information on their absentee ballot forms to create a database to track down people with arrest warrants or outstanding debt. According to Judge Marrero’s ruling on Wednesday, the pair must make calls to everyone who received the robocall and deliver this message: “At the direction of a United States district court, this call is intended to inform you that a federal court has found that the message you previously received regarding mail-in voting from Project 1599, a political organization founded by Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl, contained false information that has had the effect of intimidating voters, and thus interfering with the upcoming presidential election, in violation of federal voting-rights laws.” In addition to the mandated calls, the pair face up to seven years in prison for the Michigan charges, which include violations of election law and using a computer to commit voter intimidation. A preliminary examination on the Michigan charges is set for Thursday. In Ohio, Mr. Wohl and Mr. Burkman face charges of telecommunications fraud and bribery, which carry sentences of up to 18 years in prison. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
