As Pennsylvania sets a single-day record for virus cases, Trump holds three rallies in the state and Biden makes an appearance there. Joe Biden will travel to Iowa on Friday, a sign of his campaign’s confidence. Justice Clarence Thomas will give the oath to Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a White House official said. How Georgia, once reliably Republican, has become an improbable battleground. Trump holds a slim edge in Texas but faces big suburban losses, a New York Times/Siena College poll finds. House freshmen from swing districts are poised to help Democrats keep control. Barack Obama and LeBron James are joining forces in a late push to increase Black voter turnout. A divided Senate voted Monday night to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, capping a lightning-fast Senate approval that handed President Trump a victory only days before the election and promised to tip the court to the right for years to come. Inside a Capitol mostly emptied by the resurgent coronavirus pandemic and an election looming in just eight days, Republicans overcame unanimous opposition by Democrats to make Judge Barrett the 115th justice of the Supreme Court and the fifth woman ever to sit on its bench. In a 52-to-48 vote, all but one Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, who herself is battling for re-election, supported Judge Barrett, a 48-year-old appeals court judge and protégée of former Justice Antonin Scalia. It was the first time in 151 years that a justice was confirmed without a single vote from the minority party, a sign of how bitter Washington’s decades-old war over judicial nominations has become. The vote concluded a brazen drive by Republicans, who moved with remarkable speed to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg six weeks before the election. They shredded their own past pronouncements and bypassed rules in the process, even as they stared down the potential loss of the White House and the Senate. Democrats called it a hypocritical power grab by Republicans, who they said should have waited for voters to have their say on Election Day — the stance Republicans had taken four years ago when they declined even to hold hearings for one of former President Barack Obama’s nominees to the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland. Democrats warned of a disastrous precedent that would draw retaliation if they win power, and in a last-ditch act of protest they unsuccessfully tried to force the Senate to adjourn. Republicans said it was their right as the majority party to press ahead, and exulted in their victory. With Judge Barrett’s elevation in place of Justice Ginsburg, a liberal icon, the court is expected to tilt decisively to the right. It is gaining a conservative who could sway cases in every area of American life, including abortion rights, gay rights, business regulation and the environment. Wasting no time, Mr. Trump planned to hold an unusual nighttime swearing-in ceremony for Judge Barrett in the White House Rose Garden, a bookend to the event only a month ago when he announced her nomination at a crowded and largely maskless gathering that later turned out to be a coronavirus super-spreader event. The White House was expecting roughly 200 people to attend the ceremony, where Justice Clarence Thomas was to administer the oath to Judge Barrett, who chose him for the occasion. Her impact could be felt right away. There are major election disputes awaiting immediate action by the Supreme Court from the battleground states of North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Both concern the date by which absentee ballots may be accepted. Soon afterward, Judge Barrett will quickly confront a docket studded with major cases on Mr. Trump’s programs and policies, not to mention a potential challenge to the election results that the president had cited as a reason he needed a full complement of justices before Nov. 3. Coming up quickly are challenges related to the Affordable Care Act, signature Trump administration immigration plans, the rights of same-sex couples and the census. The court is also slated to act soon on a last-ditch attempt from Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers to block the release of his financial records to a grand jury in Manhattan. — Nicholas Fandos Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who was confirmed to the Supreme Court Monday, will almost immediately confront a host of issues concerning the election and the policies of President Trump, who placed her on the court. Here are some answers to frequently asked questions. When can she start? Justices can begin work as soon as they are sworn in, meaning she could be at work on Tuesday. Under the court’s usual practices, she cannot participate in cases that have already been argued. Should the court deadlock in some of those cases, though, the court can set them down for re-argument before the full court. Must she recuse herself from cases involving President Trump? The Supreme Court allows justices to decide whether to disqualify themselves. In the past, justices have not hesitated to sit on cases involving the presidents who appointed them. Are there election disputes awaiting decisions? Yes. The court will soon act on cases from North Carolina and Pennsylvania concerning whether deadlines for receiving mailed ballots may be extended. On Monday it ruled on a similar case in Wisconsin, rejecting by 5 to 3 a request by civil rights groups and Democrats to extend the deadline. When is she likely to hear her first arguments? Next Monday, when the court returns to the virtual bench for a two-week sitting to hear arguments by telephone. In the coming months, the Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on the fate of the Affordable Care Act, on two major Trump administration immigration policies, on whether Mr. Trump can exclude undocumented immigrants from the reapportionment of congressional seats and on whether religious groups must comply with government policies barring discrimination against same-sex couples. — Adam Liptak As officials in Pennsylvania reported at least 2,492 new coronavirus cases on Monday, the most it has seen in a single day, both President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. campaigned in the state, which is key to both of their hopes for winning the presidential election. At his first of three rallies Mr. Trump ripped into Senator Kamala Harris in demeaning and personal terms, saying, “She will not be the first woman president — you can’t let that happen” while mocking the way she laughed during her “60 Minutes” interview on Sunday. During a high-decibel, scattershot speech in Allentown that lasted well over an hour, Mr. Trump repeatedly targeted Ms. Harris — who is running for vice president, not president — in a heckling performance that mirrored his attacks on Hillary Clinton and other female foils over the years. The president went on to offer caustic negative appraisals of other prominent women he said had treated him badly — the CBS correspondent Lesley Stahl, NBC’s Savannah Guthrie and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Moments later, he trumpeted his appeal to “suburban women,” despite polls showing him trailing Mr. Biden among suburban women in battleground states by more than 20 percentage points. “Did anybody see ‘60 Minutes’ last night? Did anybody see it?” said Mr. Trump, who stormed out of his own interview with Ms. Stahl, accusing her of asking tough questions while her program lobbed softballs to Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris. “It was a total joke of a show,” he added. “Did you see his performance on that show? The only thing almost as bad was Kamala with the laugh, oh, that’s so funny. She kept laughing. I said, ‘Is there something wrong with her, too?’” Mr. Trump held three rallies in Pennsylvania, and Mr. Biden made a single stop at a voter center in Chester, just over the border from Delaware. He and Vice President Mike Pence were both holding events on the campaign trail, despite the fact that Mr. Trump had the coronavirus earlier this month and there is currently an outbreak in the vice president’s office. At an afternoon rally in Lititz, Pa., the president mocked Mr. Biden for his sparse travel schedule, saying that if he loses, “he should be ashamed of himself because he didn’t work.” He continued that line of attack on Mr. Biden in Martinsburg. “He said he doesn’t do these kinds of rallies because of Covid,” Mr. Trump told a large crowd gathered at an airport hangar, after throwing red caps into the audience. “No, he doesn’t do them because nobody shows up.” As the president held the rallies, officials in Pennsylvania reported the new single-day record for virus cases. Mr. Trump, who faces a widening gender gap, nonetheless defended his standing among women voters — in part, by making a racist appeal based on his opposition to an Obama-era program intended to integrate segregated suburbs. “I think I’m doing great with suburban women. I am saving the suburbs! I am saving the suburbs. How can I do badly?” he said to wild applause from the crowd arranged on risers outside an Allentown factory, many of them not wearing masks. “Here is what I know about suburban women,” he added. “First of all, they are great. Love our country. They want to do things. They want to leave their house alone. They don’t want the five-story project next to them or could be higher. They want to leave their house alone. They want security. OK?” After the cheering died away, Mr. Trump asked the audience, “Am I that bad? Am I that bad?” — to shouts of ‘no!” Mr. Trump also repeated falsehoods about the ballot-counting process in Pennsylvania and expressed solidarity with groups of supporters who have been showing up at polling sites to videotape people attempting to vote, a practice the state’s attorney general has called voter intimidation. “We’re watching you very closely, Philadelphia,” he said. — Glenn Thrush, Annie Karni and Michael Cooper TRANSCRIPT “I’m going to Iowa, I’m going to Wisconsin, I’m going to Georgia, I’m going to Florida and maybe other places as well. I met today with a group of leaders in the Democratic Party, laying out where we’re going to go, getting their input and the like. So, we’re constantly, there has not been a day that hasn’t been a 12-hour day yet. I am not overconfident about anything. I just want to make sure we can earn every vote possible. That’s why we’re here. And you know that blue wall is going to be, has to be reestablished.” Joseph R. Biden Jr. will travel to Iowa this week, he announced on Monday, a sign of confidence that suggests his campaign is significantly expanding its electoral map with just eight days left in the presidential race. “I’m going to be going to Iowa, be going to Wisconsin, I’m going to Georgia, I’m going to Florida and maybe other places as well,” Mr. Biden said during a stop at a voter center in Chester, Pa. And in a remarkably bold pronouncement for a Democratic presidential candidate, Mr. Biden declared that he would win Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota, three critical battleground states that might be his key to victory. He also said he thought he had a “fighting chance” in Ohio, North Carolina, Georgia and Iowa, states that were once thought to be a reach for Democrats but that recent polls indicate are now up for grabs. “I am not overconfident about anything,” Mr. Biden said. “I just want to make sure we can earn every vote possible.” “That blue wall has to be re-established,” he added, referring to the Northern battleground states, which are traditionally Democratic. Mr. Biden’s call to resurrect the “blue wall,” which President Trump knocked down in 2016, and his announcement of an intense final push that includes visits to Iowa and Georgia, both states that Mr. Trump won handily, suggest that the Biden campaign feels it is in a position of strength heading into the final stretch. It also comes as some Democrats have privately expressed concern about Mr. Biden’s relatively light schedule during the coronavirus pandemic even as he is leading in polls. He traveled to Pennsylvania on Saturday, but his only in-person appearance on Sunday was going to church near his home in Delaware. (He also made a brief appearance during a virtual concert held by his campaign.) Trying to stave off any criticism about his travel, Mr. Biden on Monday offered an explanation for his careful approach to campaigning during the pandemic. “The big difference between us and the reason why it looks like we’re not traveling — we’re not putting on superspreaders,” he said. It is not unheard-of for campaigns to make late forays into long-shot states, sometimes to force their opponents to spend more resources there and sometimes to help down-ballot Senate or House candidates. But polling has suggested that Mr. Biden is competitive in both Georgia and Iowa, where the Democratic Senate candidate, Theresa Greenfield, is also in a tight race. An average of current polls shows Mr. Biden with a narrow edge of three percentage points over Mr. Trump in Iowa, according to The Upshot’s calculator, and roughly tied with the president in Georgia. — Sydney Ember Justice Clarence Thomas will give the constitutional oath to Judge Amy Coney Barrett at the White House on Monday night after she is officially confirmed to the Supreme Court by the Senate, a White House official said. There is expected to be a ceremony honoring Judge Barrett after the vote, but Mr. Thomas will administer the official oath to her as she assumes her new role, the official said. Judge Barrett chose Justice Thomas to swear her in partly because she admires his life story, but also because she clerked for the court while he was on the bench, an administration official said. A ceremony for Judge Barrett is the type of event that President Trump has enjoyed hosting at the White House. But the prospect of an event with dozens of people has already raised questions, given that an outdoor event in her honor held on Sept. 26 has been associated with an outbreak of the coronavirus that impacted President Trump, the first lady, and a half-dozen aides and advisers. It also comes at a time when Judge Barrett could end up hearing cases related to the 2020 election. — Maggie Haberman Political campaigns rushed to submit their digital advertisements to Facebook before the end of the day Monday, ahead of a rule imposed by the social media company that bans new political ads in the week before Election Day. The range of campaigns covered by the rule, which goes into effect at midnight on Monday, reaches beyond just candidates and their parties. In fact, some of the biggest spenders in key battleground states may be surprising, according to new research published by Tech for Campaigns, a technology nonprofit that works with left-leaning campaigns. In a blog post analyzing the top 20 digital Facebook ad spenders, excluding presidential and federal candidates, as well as super PACs, the group found that relatively unknown organizations like Catholic Vote, a conservative religious advocacy group; Numbers U.S.A., which pushes for tighter immigration restrictions; and Acronym, a which backs progressive causes, were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to sway voters ahead of Election Day. In Michigan,  Numbers USA has spent $186,000 on Facebook ads over the last four weeks urging Congress to “pause immigration.” Another group, led by the former assistant manager to the Trump campaign, David Bossie, has spent $175,000 in the state on ads that support the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court — a campaign that ended in victory for Mr. Trump and Republicans on Monday — and down-ballot Republican candidates. In Pennsylvania, The Keystone, an organization that appears to be a local news outlet but which produces partisan content financed by Acronym, has spent half a million dollars on Facebook ads supporting various Democratic candidates. Another organization called the Commonwealth Leaders Fund, a PAC backed by right-wing donors including Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, has spent $103,000 on Facebook ads against state and local Democratic candidates in the state. BlackPAC, which is devoted to registering and mobilizing Black voters, has spent $200,000 on ads in Florida over the last month, many of them advising people on how to vote by mail. And Catholic Vote, which seeks to elect candidates who support Catholic teachings, has spent $42,000 in the state, much of it advertising against the Biden campaign’s stance on abortion. Jessica Alter, a co-founder of Tech for Campaigns, said the organizations were “a microcosm of how money flows to issues and states — where everything from voting rights to redistricting will be decided.” — Sheera Frenkel Georgia, a Republican stronghold for nearly two decades, is growing fast and changing in profound ways that are giving Democrats big hopes for 2020. With only a week left before the Nov. 3 election, polls show President Trump, who won Georgia by five points in 2016, locked in a virtual tie with his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., who plans to visit the state on Tuesday. At the same time, two well-funded Democratic candidates, Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, are running competitive races for the state’s two Senate seats. Representative Lucy McBath, a Democrat, is favored to win re-election to her suburban Atlanta House seat against Karen Handel, whom she beat in 2018. The suburban Atlanta House seat of a retiring Republican is expected to flip to the Democrats. Some Democrats even dream of capturing the state House. All this is happening in a diverse state whose new politics are defined by young voters, suburban women alienated by Mr. Trump, and minorities energized by the Democrat Stacey Abrams and her near-miss bid in 2018 to become the country’s first African-American woman governor. Georgia Democrats — stung in the past by premature talk of a realignment of the state’s politics — are careful to temper their optimism. The Republican Party remains well-organized, popular and powerful here. Republicans hold every elected statewide office, control both chambers of the state Legislature, still command a majority among college-educated white voters, and maintain a dominance in rural counties. Jason Carter, the grandson of President Jimmy Carter and a Democrat who was soundly defeated in the 2014 race for governor, joked, “Frankly, I think it would be impossible for Trump to win — and I haven’t been this confident since 2016,” when Hillary Clinton’s campaign dared to dream of a Georgia victory. Yet there is a bipartisan consensus that the state is not exactly what it was, even just a few years ago. Its population surged from 7.9 million to 10.6 million people from 2000 to 2019, and its foreign-born population now exceeds 10 percent. While Republicans remain formidable in rural areas, an accurate portrait of 21st Century Georgia would have to include not only peach and peanut farms, but also Your DeKalb Farmers Market, a global culinary bazaar in the Atlanta suburbs staffed by workers from 40 countries that attracts both immigrants and native-born bourgeois bohemians. — Richard Fausset President Trump maintains a narrow edge in Texas, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll on Monday, as he faces a rebellion in the state’s once overwhelmingly Republican suburbs. Mr. Trump leads Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Texas by 47 percent to 43 percent among likely voters, the survey found, which is within the poll’s margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The survey of 802 likely voters was mostly conducted before the final presidential debate on Thursday. In the Senate race, the Republican incumbent, John Cornyn, holds a larger lead, 48-38, over the Democrat, M.J. Hegar. Polls have shown a competitive race in Texas all cycle, but the Biden campaign has made only limited efforts to contest the state. The Republican grip on Texas has deteriorated rapidly during the Trump era, as a Democratic breakthrough in the suburbs has endangered more than one-third of the state’s Republican congressional delegation and Republican control of the state House. In these districts, Republicans face a combination of rapid demographic change and previously unthinkable Democratic gains among white college-educated voters. Mr. Trump leads Mr. Biden by just two points among white college graduates in these districts, even though they say they backed Mr. Trump by 24 points over Hillary Clinton in 2016. The survey suggested that Mr. Biden’s support among Hispanic voters, 57 percent to 34 percent, is weaker than Mrs. Clinton’s was four years ago. The finding broadly tracks with national surveys, which have shown Mr. Trump improving among Hispanic voters compared with his 2016 standing. In 2018, Times/Siena surveys generally underestimated turnout by Hispanics and their support for Democrats in Texas. So far this cycle, polls have varied widely on Mr. Trump’s standing among the group in Texas, with a recent Quinnipiac survey showing Mr. Biden ahead by just eight points, 51-43, while a Dallas Morning News/UT Tyler Texas survey showed him ahead by a far wider margin, 67-20. — Nate Cohn When Representative Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat running for re-election in the conservative-leaning suburbs of Richmond, Va., arrived to debate her Republican opponent one recent evening, she received a heroine’s welcome from cheering supporters lining the street, holding balloons and handmade signs. There was no such warm reception for Nick Freitas, the state delegate running to oust her, recalled Carol Catron, 52, who was among those shouting “We love Abigail!” as Mr. Freitas walked in without making eye contact. The scene in a Republican-leaning district that voted heavily for President Trump in 2016 underscored how solidly Ms. Spanberger — a freshman once thought to have an uphill climb to re-election — has cemented her following and has the advantage with Election Day approaching. Across the country, Democrats like Ms. Spanberger, a former C.I.A. officer who has cultivated a brand as a moderate unafraid to criticize her own party, have helped positioned Democrats to maintain control of the House and build their majority. She and dozens of other first-term Democrats whose victories in Trump-friendly districts in 2018 handed the party control of the House — and who were seen as the most vulnerable to defeat this year — are leading their Republican challengers in polling and fund-raising headed into the election’s final week. Speaker Nancy Pelosi likes to call this group of about 40 lawmakers — mostly young, many women, and predominantly moderates — her “majority makers.” They have largely managed to buck intense Republican attempts to brand them as Ms. Pelosi’s minions, socialists or out-of-touch coastal elites. “We knew we had a lot of work to do when we got elected, and we got to work,” said Representative Lauren Underwood, Democrat of Illinois and a registered nurse. — Luke Broadwater Former President Barack Obama will continue his efforts to increase Black voter turnout ahead of the election, including an interview with the basketball star LeBron James set to be published this week. Mr. Obama joined Mr. James for the interview as a part of the athlete’s More Than A Vote initiative, according to sources familiar with the event. More Than A Vote, the collective of athletes led by Mr. James, has focused its political efforts on issues like limiting misinformation among Black voters and increasing poll workers in Black communities. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. James said he cared more about seeing Black turnout increase than President Trump’s removal. “You can see it every time. Who didn’t vote? What counties didn’t vote? What communities didn’t vote? And a lot of that has had to do with our Black people,” Mr. James said. “So, hopefully, we can get them out and educated and let them understand how important this moment is.” Mr. Obama’s efforts to increase turnout come as some Democrats worry that Black voters, and specifically Black men, could back President Trump in greater numbers in this year’s election. National polling shows Mr. Biden with a healthy lead over Mr. Trump heading into the campaign’s final days. However, the same polling shows Mr. Biden with tepid numbers for a Democrat among Black voters, traditionally one of the party’s most loyal constituencies. In recent stops for Mr. Biden’s campaign, Mr. Obama, the nation’s first Black president, implored Black voters to support his former vice president. Black voter turnout reached record highs in 2012, when Mr. Obama won re-election, but fell in key swing states for Hillary Clinton in 2016. In addition to his interview with Mr. James, Mr. Obama also has spoken with Black men in Philadelphia and recorded a video message for the Shade Room, a media company whose social media and pop culture sites are popular with young Black Americans. In Philadelphia this week, Mr. Obama spoke directly to Black men. “What I’ve consistently tried to communicate this year, particularly when I’m talking to young brothers, who may be cynical of what can happen, is to acknowledge to them that government and voting alone is not going to change everything,” Mr. Obama said. “But we did make things better.” — Astead W. Herndon President Trump walked out of his interview last week with the long-running CBS program “60 Minutes” and publicly accused its anchor Lesley Stahl of “bias, hatred and rudeness.” If Mr. Trump had hoped to dissuade viewers from watching the contentious interview — in which the president balked as Ms. Stahl questioned him about the coronavirus, the economy and health care and told her, “That’s no way to talk” — his tactics proved ill-advised. Nearly 17 million people watched Sunday’s “60 Minutes” broadcast, the show’s biggest audience since it secured an interview with the adult film actress (and alleged Trump paramour) Stormy Daniels in 2018, according to preliminary data from Nielsen. “60 Minutes” has the broadest reach of any TV news program, a category whose audience skews older, meaning Mr. Trump’s less-than-optimal interview was seen by millions of Americans above the age of 50, who are likely to be engaged in the political process — and a group Mr. Trump has been struggling with, according to opinion polls. This Sunday’s episode, which featured interviews with Mr. Trump, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and their running mates, drew more viewers than Game 5 of the World Series and an evening N.F.L. game on NBC. In fact, save for sporting events and the political conventions and debates, Sunday’s “60 Minutes” episode notched the biggest television audience of the year for any network since the Academy Awards in February, CBS officials said. The total audience for Mr. Trump’s interview was likely even higher, between online streaming views and additional viewing data that Nielsen is compiling and will release on Tuesday. — Michael M. Grynbaum The New York Post on Monday became the largest of a narrow set of newspapers to endorse President Trump for re-election, writing in an editorial that, despite being “vainglorious,” Mr. Trump had presided over an economic revival before the coronavirus pandemic and had “defended pride in American values.” While newspaper endorsements have been few and far between for Mr. Trump, who has relished his frequent jousts with the news media, a number of publications have broken with tradition of not making endorsements or backing Republicans to support Mr. Biden. For the first time in more than 100 years, one of the largest newspapers in New Hampshire, where Mr. Trump campaigned on Sunday, endorsed a Democrat for president. The Union Leader of Manchester wrote that while “Mr. Biden is not perfect,” it could not bring itself to back Mr. Trump, whom the newspaper wrote “is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America." Last week, USA Today’s editorial board made its first presidential endorsement in its 38-year history, calling for readers to vote for Mr. Biden and “reject” Mr. Trump. And earlier this month, The New England Journal of Medicine, which has been staunchly nonpartisan throughout its 208-year history, repudiated the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic, though it did not explicitly endorse Mr. Biden. Scientific American, however, did endorse Mr. Biden, in what it said was its first presidential endorsement in its 175-year history. The Post, a favored outlet for Mr. Trump since his days as a New York developer, is owned by the media baron Rupert Murdoch. It lauded the president for lowering corporate taxes and for his trade war with China, which it wrote had reduced the unemployment rate and raised wages. Its endorsement played down Mr. Trump’s handling of the pandemic and contended that it was not clear whether the Democratic presidential candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., would do anything different, other than trigger more lockdowns. “We can put annus horribilis, 2020, behind us and make America great again, again,” the Post wrote. Mr. Trump touted The Post’s endorsement at a rally later on Monday in Martinsburg, Pa., praising the paper “because they’re the only one with the courage to do it.” Mr. Trump’s other newspaper endorsements include the Las Vegas Review-Journal, which is owned by the casino mogul and Republican donor Sheldon Adelson; The Gazette in Colorado Springs, Colo.; and The Spokesman-Review in Spokane, Wash. Each of those endorsements, though, tempered support of Mr. Trump with pointed criticism of his personal conduct and cantankerous style, with The Spokesman-Review calling Mr. Trump a “bully and a bigot.” — Neil Vigdor AD WATCH Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign has returned to a familiar Democratic refrain in the final weeks of the 2020 campaign: promising to protect Social Security and accusing President Trump of undermining the program. There are a lot of 2020 ads about Social Security currently airing, including this one from the Biden campaign pic.twitter.com/WGoXUVKess One of Mr. Biden’s Social Security ads is narrated by an older voter in a long-sleeved union shirt, identified as “Mike” from Wayne County, Mich. “Donald Trump — he’s talking about messing with my Social Security?” says Mike. “Them guys think it’s monopoly money?” he asks defensively as video flashes of the president with some of his administration officials. “No, it’s our money. We worked for it. You don’t get to play with my financials.” The ad is tailored to older voters who Mr. Biden has polled better with than past Democrats. “He understands what seniors are going through,” Mike says. “We need to get Biden in there to protect it.” This particular Biden ad does not make specific claims about Mr. Trump’s plans for Social Security, but other Democratic ads have been more explicit, accusing Mr. Trump of supporting plans that would “wipe out” Social Security. At issue is that Mr. Trump has expressed support for cutting the payroll tax, which funds Social Security. At the same time, Mr. Trump has said “we’re not going to touch Social Security” and promises to forgive deferred payroll taxes without impacting the program. The ad also tries to reassure voters that Mr. Biden is going to protect their government benefits. His current plan calls for putting more resources behind Social Security, which would be paid for by higher taxes on the wealthy. The ad — which the Biden campaign has spent nearly $3.2 million on in the last two weeks — is running nationally and in many of the top battlegrounds, including Arizona, Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina and Nevada. The top market for the ad is Phoenix, which is home to a large retiree population. In the closing stretch, many of Mr. Trump’s ads are accusing Mr. Biden of wanting to raise taxes, and many of Mr. Biden’s are focused on Social Security. These campaign tactics show the continued resilience and resonance of those two political standbys — even amid a pandemic. — Shane Goldmacher Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has been spearheading the Trump campaign’s outreach to Black voters for over a year, arguing that even if President Trump can increase his support among them by as little as two percentage points, it could sway the election. On Monday, in an interview with “Fox & Friends,” however, he made comments seeming to question whether Black Americans “want to be successful,” a remark that played into a racist stereotype and was quickly seized on by the Democratic National Committee. “One thing we’ve seen in a lot of the Black community, which is mostly Democrat, is that President Trump’s policies are the policies that can help people break out of the problems that they’re complaining about,” Mr. Kushner said. “But he can’t want them to be successful more than they want to be successful.” The D.N.C. responded to Mr. Kushner’s remarks with a lengthy statement. “According to the Trump administration, when African Americans find fault in policies that have led to historic unemployment for Black families, an explosion of racial inequities and wealth gaps, and an uncontained global pandemic that has taken the lives of over 45,000 Black Americans, it means that we just don’t want to be successful badly enough,” it said. “This dismissive approach to the issues that Black voters care about is indicative of Trump’s callousness and disregard for the lives of Black people.” Mr. Kushner’s comments were widely denounced on social media. “We will remember his casual racism,” Representative Don Beyer of Virginia, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, claimed that Mr. Kushner’s remarks had been taken out of context. Mr. Kushner’s comment came after a discussion of racial unrest, which he referred to as “the George Floyd situation,” a reference to the Black man who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis this summer. Mr. Kushner accused many protesters of virtue signaling. “They’d go on Instagram and cry or they would put a slogan on their jersey, or write something on a basketball court,” he said. “And quite frankly, that was doing more to polarize the country than it was to bring people forward.” He claimed what was more important was policies that have helped Black Americans, like criminal justice reform and the funding Mr. Trump has supported for historically Black colleges and universities. Those have been two of the administration’s main talking points in its outreach to Black voters, even as the president has made it clear in recent months that he believes the country’s real racism problem is bias against white Americans. Mr. Kushner said he has been hearing from Trump campaign state directors across the country about a “groundswell of support in the Black community, because they’re realizing that all of the different bad things that the media and the Democrats have said about President Trump are not true.” A recent CBS News poll found that 85 percent of registered Black voters felt that as president, Mr. Trump “favors white people.” About 79 percent of those voters said he “worked against” Black people. — Annie Karni The news over the weekend that another coronavirus outbreak had struck the White House, infecting Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff and four other top aides, further underscored the Trump administration’s cavalier approach to the worst health crisis in a century. “We’re not going to control the pandemic,” Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday morning, essentially offering a verbal shrug in response to any effort to prevent an outbreak in the top echelon of the nation’s leaders. “We are going to control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics and other mitigations, because it is a contagious virus — just like the flu.” The in-house outbreak, playing against the national backdrop of the biggest three-day total of new infections in the entire course of the pandemic, is also making it harder for the president to change the subject as he dashes through swing states in a bid to mount a come-from-behind victory. “Covid, Covid. Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid,” Mr. Trump had groused at a rally in North Carolina on Saturday, hours before the revelation of the infections on his running mate’s staff. He made up a scenario: “A plane goes down, 500 people dead, they don’t talk about it. ‘Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid.’” Mr. Trump made no reference to the new cases during campaign rallies in New Hampshire and Maine on Sunday. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, said Sunday that the statement by Mr. Meadows was “an acknowledgment of what President Trump’s strategy has clearly been from the beginning of this crisis: to wave the white flag of defeat and hope that by ignoring it, the virus would simply go away.
