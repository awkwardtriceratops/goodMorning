What will it take to vote in Milwaukee? Andrea Campbell, Boston’s first Black City Council president, jumps into the mayor’s race. President Trump’s refusal to commit to accepting the results of November’s election — something no president in modern memory has put in doubt — led several prominent Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to insist Thursday that there would be a peaceful transfer of power in January. But they stopped short of directly criticizing the president for comments he made on Wednesday suggesting otherwise. “The winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th,” Mr. McConnell wrote on Twitter early Thursday. “There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792.” Mr. McConnell never named Mr. Trump in his comments, and he refused to elaborate on them when reporters pressed him on Capitol Hill a short time later. But his tweet was in response to remarks the president made at the White House Wednesday, when he replied to a reporter asking if he would guarantee a peaceful transition by saying, “We’re going to have to see what happens.” Mr. Trump went on to question the integrity of the balloting and said if he were able to “Get rid of the ballots,” and ensure a “continuation” rather than a “transfer,” it would be peaceful.    The peaceful transfer of power, and accepting the results of an election, is a bedrock principle of democracy. Many Republicans were silent about Mr. Trump’s comments, though Mr. McConnell was one of several who issued carefully worded statements distancing themselves without calling the president out by name. Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, a frequent critic of Mr. Trump’s who this week declared his support for allowing the president to quickly fill the Supreme Court vacancy left open by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death, was first to air his concern. “Fundamental to democracy is the peaceful transition of power; without that, there is Belarus. Any suggestion that a president might not respect this Constitutional guarantee is both unthinkable and unacceptable,” Mr. Romney wrote on Twitter Wednesday night. Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming and the third-ranking House Republican, took a similar line early Thursday, tweeting: “The peaceful transfer of power is enshrined in our Constitution and fundamental to the survival of our Republic. America’s leaders swear an oath to the Constitution. We will uphold that oath.” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who has moderated his criticism of the president after lashing Mr. Trump during the 2016 Republican primary debates, also avoided referring to him directly in his response on Thursday. “As we have done for over two centuries we will have a legitimate & fair election. It may take longer than usual to know the outcome, but it will be a valid one,” wrote Mr. Rubio, who is also supporting Mr. Trump’s move to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. “And at noon on Jan. 20, 2021 we will peacefully swear in the President.” So did Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, who tweeted, “Regardless of how divided our country is right now, when elections are over and winners are declared, we must all commit ourselves to the Constitution and accept the results.” Yet some Republicans struck a defiant tone. Former Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who has been helping Vice President Mike Pence prepare for the upcoming debates, tweeted: “Smart candidates never concede anything before an election. They focus on what it takes to win.” Mr. Trump’s remarks, though, were not about whether he would be willing to concede on election night. They were about whether he would ultimately step aside if he lost. There was scant mention of Mr. Trump’s comments on the president’s favorite network, Fox News, on Wednesday, with the hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham focusing on other topics. But in an interview on Fox on Thursday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, used the outcry over Mr. Trump’s remarks to push for the quick confirmation of a conservative Supreme Court justice, arguing that the seat should be filled in case the nation’s highest court needed to rule on the outcome of the November election. “People wonder about the peaceful transfer of power,” he said. “I can assure you, it will be peaceful.” “I promise you as a Republican, if the Supreme Court decides that Joe Biden wins, I will accept the result,” Mr. Graham added “The court will decide and if Republicans lose, we’ll accept the result.” — Emily Cochrane and Glenn Thrush President Trump’s refusal on Wednesday to commit to a peaceful transfer of power enraged Democrats and again put Republicans in a difficult position as their party leader continued to make remarks aimed at delegitimizing the election. And this was no typical Trump provocation: Acceding to the will of the voters is the linchpin of American democracy. “Any suggestion that a president might not respect this constitutional guarantee is both unthinkable and unacceptable,” Senator Mitt Romney of Utah said on Wednesday night. For Republicans hoping to retain the White House and the Senate, it was something else: unhelpful. G.O.P. lawmakers and strategists have, for the first time in weeks, expressed optimism about their prospects. Their hope: that the coming fight over filling the Supreme Court seat held by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will turn attention away from Mr. Trump and the coronavirus and refocus it on a more partisan, red-and-blue clash. But Mr. Trump does not appear intent on cooperating with these plans. His comments about the transfer of power were only his latest provocation — of the day. Earlier Wednesday, he flatly predicted that the presidential election would end up in the Supreme Court and said that was why he wanted a full slate of justices, barely concealing his hope for a friendly majority on the court. “I think this will end up in the Supreme Court and I think it’s very important that we have nine justices, and I think the system’s going to go very quickly,” Mr. Trump said of the need for a quick confirmation process. The night before, at a rally near Pittsburgh, Mr. Trump hurled xenophobic attacks at Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who immigrated to the United States from Somalia as a girl in the 1990s. “She’s telling us how to run our country,” the president said. “How did you do where you came from? How is your country doing?” The night before that, at another rally, Mr. Trump said the coronavirus “affects virtually nobody” — never mind that the country’s death toll from the virus just crossed 200,000. This is all to say that the Republican hopes of the Supreme Court fight reshaping the election will have to contend with a president determined, intentionally or not, to keep the focus on himself. — Jonathan Martin President Trump is on the defensive in three red states he carried in 2016, narrowly trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Iowa and battling to stay ahead of him in Georgia and Texas, as Mr. Trump continues to face a wall of opposition from women that has also endangered his party’s control of the Senate, according to a poll conducted by The New York Times and Siena College. Joe Biden has made significant gains in states Donald Trump won handily in 2016. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely voters from Sept. 16 to Sept. 22. Mr. Trump’s vulnerability even in conservative-leaning states underscores just how precarious his political position is, less than six weeks before Election Day. While he and Mr. Biden are competing aggressively for traditional swing states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida, the poll suggests that Mr. Biden has assembled a coalition formidable enough to jeopardize Mr. Trump even in historically Republican parts of the South and Midwest. A yawning gender gap in all three states is working in Mr. Biden’s favor, with the former vice president making inroads into conservative territory with strong support from women. In Iowa, where Mr. Biden is ahead of Mr. Trump, 45 percent to 42 percent, he is up among women by 14 percentage points. Men favor Mr. Trump by eight points. In Georgia, where the two candidates are tied at 45 percent, Mr. Biden leads among women by 10 points. Mr. Trump is ahead with men by a similar margin of 11 percentage points. Mr. Trump’s large advantage among men in Texas is enough to give him a small advantage there, 46 percent to 43 percent. Men prefer the president to his Democratic challenger by 16 points, while women favor Mr. Biden by an eight-point margin. — Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin TRANSCRIPT [crowd jeering] Crowd: “Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out!” President Trump paid his respects to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Thursday morning, standing silently by her coffin at the top of the Supreme Court steps as he was jeered by protesters on the street below. Wearing a face mask — unusual for him — and a sky-blue tie instead of his trademark red power tie, Mr. Trump stared ahead, and closed his eyes at times, near the justice’s flag-draped coffin. But the quiet of the moment was punctured by the boos and shouts of demonstrators about a block away. “Honor her wish!” yelled some, a reference to Justice Ginsburg’s deathbed request that her replacement not be confirmed until a “new president is installed.” Others shouted “Vote him out!” It was not clear whether Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, who joined him, could hear the heckling, which was clearly audible on television. They stayed for less than two minutes. Following Mr. Trump was his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien. Both men also wore masks, and bowed their heads with their eyes closed. Justice Ginsburg, who died last Friday, lay in repose at the court on Wednesday and Thursday. — Michael Crowley Mary L. Trump, President Trump’s niece, filed a lawsuit Thursday accusing the president and his siblings of cheating her out of her inheritance, and claiming that, for the Trumps, “fraud was not just the family business — it was a way of life.” The suit by Ms. Trump, who claimed in her best-selling memoir that the president and other relatives had tricked, bullied and ultimately cheated her out of an inheritance worth tens of millions of dollars, was filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. It accused Mr. Trump, his sister Maryanne Trump Barry and their brother Robert, who died in August, of fraud and civil conspiracy. It seeks to recover the millions of dollars Ms. Trump claims to have lost. Ms. Trump, 55, claims to be one of her family’s victims. Her suit describes a plot against her, broken cinematically into three separate acts: “The Grift,” “The Devaluing” and “The Squeeze-Out.” It recounts a narrative that began in 1981, when Ms. Trump’s father, Fred Trump Jr., unexpectedly died, leaving her, at age 16, with a valuable minority stake in the family empire. The story ends nearly 40 years later, when Ms. Trump says she discovered, with the help of journalists from The New York Times, that President Trump and his siblings “used their position of power to con her into signing her interests away.” The White House has previously cast doubt on Ms. Trump’s book, which contains similar allegations, and has said the memoir was “in Ms. Trump’s own financial interest.” Lawyers for the president and Robert Trump were not immediately available for comment. Maryanne Trump Barry also did not immediately return a telephone call from a reporter.  — Alan Feuer Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday shied away from two major issues of deep importance to Democrats, giving cautious responses to reporters’ questions about the police shooting of Breonna Taylor and President Trump’s imminent nomination for the Supreme Court. Several hours after a grand jury in Kentucky declined to charge any officers in the killing of Ms. Taylor, indicting one for endangering her neighbors during a raid, Mr. Biden said in response to a reporter’s question that he had “not seen the report” and that he knew only broad information. “I was told going in that there’s one charge against one of the officers. I don’t know the details,” Mr. Biden said, before vowing “to try to find that out” on his plane ride home from Charlotte, N.C. Pressed for a fuller response, Mr. Biden again responded, “I don’t know the details, so I’m reluctant to comment.” Two hours later, he issued a statement, sent by his campaign. “A federal investigation remains ongoing, but we do not need to wait for the final judgment of that investigation to do more to deliver justice for Breonna,” Mr. Biden said in the statement. He said the use of “excessive force” needed to be addressed and made an appeal against violence. On another critical topic, the Supreme Court, Mr. Biden gave a similarly tentative answer. Asked what he thought of Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who is considered Mr. Trump’s leading contender, Mr. Biden said: “I don’t know her. I just know what’s reported in the press,” before repeating his talking points on the court. Mr. Biden’s hesitancy to engage with top-of-mind issues reflected the risk-averse approach he has taken to several facets of his campaign, including limited interactions with voters who might challenge him and relatively few exchanges with reporters during a period of restricted travel and press availability because of the coronavirus. And it underscores the gamble Mr. Biden’s campaign has made for months: that American voters will reward his sober, measured approach to politics, which stands in sharp contrast to Mr. Trump’s. — Sydney Ember The two Republicans on the North Carolina Board of Elections resigned in protest late Wednesday, after elections officials on Tuesday agreed to extend the deadline for receiving mail ballots in North Carolina by six days. In their letters of resignation, the two Republicans, Ken Raymond and David Black, both claimed they had been misinformed about the settlement that had extended the deadline for ballots to be counted. Justin Clark, President Trump’s deputy campaign manager, called the resignations a “courageous stand against the egregious and collusive settlement agreement their Democrat counterparts created that would significantly rewrite North Carolina’s election law — 40 days out from Election Day.” Mr. Clark also accused “liberal activists” of trying to “rig” the election. In North Carolina, where polls show Mr. Trump tied or narrowly trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Trump campaign has mounted an assault against the integrity of the state elections board. Mr. Clark accused Democratic activists of suing “to move Election Day even further out so they can harvest ballots after the polls close to steal the election for Joe Biden.” A group called the North Carolina Alliance for Retired Americans had sued the state last month demanding changes to election rules to account for mail delays and accommodate voters fearful of the coronavirus. In an agreement settling the lawsuit that was signed on Sept. 22, the state elections board acceded to several of the group’s demands. Under the settlement, ballots postmarked by Election Day will be counted if they are received by Nov. 12 — six days after the previous deadline. In addition, voters who make mistakes on their mail-in ballots, like missing signatures or addresses, may correct those errors until Nov. 12. Drop boxes for mail-in ballots will be set up outside early voting sites and at county elections offices. The agreement was immediately criticized by the state’s Republican lawmakers and Trump campaign officials, who indicated that they planned to continue a legal fight to overturn it — and that they would pursue similar legal strategies in other battleground states like Pennsylvania, Minnesota and Michigan, where judges could extend the period during which votes can be counted. North Carolina, which Mr. Trump won by four percentage points in 2016, is critical to his re-election, especially as his polling numbers have recently slipped in the industrial Midwest, and advisers are increasingly worried about his chances in the state. — Annie Karni and Stephanie Saul Joseph R. Biden Jr. has piled up endorsements from officials who would likely have backed almost any Republican not named Donald Trump, but one name leaps from the lengthy list of 489 national security experts who announced their support for Mr. Biden on Thursday: Gen. Paul J. Selva. General Selva, a retired four-star Air Force general with 40 years in uniform, served as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents Obama and Trump from 2015 until his retirement in July 2019. In that capacity, he was the second-highest ranked officer in the country, putting him at the center of major military decisions made on the president’s watch, and in frequent proximity to Mr. Trump. “The current president has demonstrated he is not equal to the enormous responsibilities of his office; he cannot rise to meet challenges large or small,” read the “Open Letter to America” signed by several platoons-worth of experts, ex-generals and former top administration officials, some of whom served under Republican presidents. “Thanks to his disdainful attitude and his failures, our allies no longer trust or respect us, and our enemies no longer fear us,” they wrote, citing what they said was Mr. Trump’s failure to confront aggression by North Korea and Russia. “Only F.D.R. and Abraham Lincoln came into office facing more monumental crises than the next president.” General Selva, a decorated pilot who served in the Gulf War, joins a host of other former top Trump military and national security advisers — from the former National Security Adviser John Bolton to many lesser-known Pentagon officials — who have questioned Mr. Trump’s capacity to serve as commander in chief. At least two other former military leaders on the list also served under Mr. Trump: Adm. Paul Zukunft of the Coast Guard, who retired in 2018, and Vice Adm. P. Gardner Howe III, a retired Navy SEAL commander. — Glenn Thrush THE UPSHOT The most recent New York Times/Siena College polls of Texas, Iowa and Georgia found no serious evidence that the sudden opening of a Supreme Court seat, and the battle to fill it, has affected the race for the White House. Nor did the polls find much reason to think this would shift the race in the weeks ahead. The surveys were already underway before the death on Friday of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and neither Joe Biden nor President Trump fared meaningfully better in interviews conducted after her death. Opinions about the Supreme Court fight seemed poised to split along familiar partisan lines, with little advantage to either side. Beginning on Sunday, voters were asked three questions about the Supreme Court, although none in Iowa, where the survey was mostly complete by Sunday: The people who received these questions were not representative of the overall survey — it wound up being a Republican-leaning group — because many interviews had already been conducted. Among the respondents who were asked the question, Mr. Trump led by six points, compared with the even race across the three surveys over all. Most of the respondents were in Texas. These voters said they trusted Mr. Trump over Mr. Biden to choose the next Supreme Court Justice by a six-point margin — the same as his overall lead among those respondents. This Republican-leaning group also preferred that the winner of the presidential election choose the next Supreme Court justice, rather than have Mr. Trump appoint the next justice before the election, by a 12-point margin. Yet at the same time, the results suggested that Mr. Trump was unlikely to face a serious political cost: By a 14-point margin, the same voters thought the Senate should act on any Trump nominee before the election. — Nate Cohn DAILY SCHEDULES Here are the daily schedules of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates for Thursday, Sept. 24.

He was born in Mississippi, where, he said, his family was terrorized by the Ku Klux Klan for attempting to cast ballots. This background makes him feel “a deep historical tie with trying to get people to vote.” In 2020, he is aware of a different threat when it comes to working the polls: the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Miller, who is 70 and has a heart condition, said the risk was too high. Ten of his friends have died from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. The pandemic is making voting more complicated, with higher stakes. But, activists note, it’s just one more thing to worry about on top of strict identification and mail-in ballot laws that can disproportionately make it difficult for eligible low-income voters, and Black and Latino voters, to cast their ballots. In 2016, President Trump won Wisconsin by just 23,000 votes — the first time a Republican presidential candidate carried the state since 1984. Turnout was down that year by almost 19 percent for Black voters and 6 percent for Latino voters, which is part of the reason turnout groups are focused on those populations this year. Polls show a close race between Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Trump, but disapproval by a majority of Mr. Trump’s handling of the virus. Across the city’s predominantly Black North Side and Latino South Side, organizers and activists are registering new voters and helping others navigate the system. “Black people have been intimidated not to vote since we were three-fifths of a man,” Mr. Miller said, referring to a clause in the original U.S. Constitution. He described a lack of voter education which, in his view, has led to disenfranchisement in the North as a “a different form of Jim Crow.” — Alyssa Schukar Boston’s 2021 mayoral race heated up further on Thursday with the announcement that Andrea Campbell, the first Black woman to serve as City Council president, will enter the race, presumably challenging the city’s popular incumbent and a fellow Democrat, Mayor Marty Walsh. Ms. Campbell is the second woman to enter the race for a position that has only ever been occupied by white men. City Councilor Michelle Wu, a protégé of Senator Elizabeth Warren and a favorite of city progressives, entered the race last week. Unlike Ms. Wu, Ms. Campbell, 38, is a native of Boston. She spent her childhood bouncing among foster families, often on public assistance, as her father served a prison sentence before thriving in Boston’s public schools and attending Princeton University. She served as deputy legal counsel in the administration of Gov. Deval Patrick. Ms. Campbell has focused heavily on the issues of policing and racial injustice, returning often to the painful story of her twin brother, Andre, who served a series of prison terms and died in pretrial custody, at 29, of an untreated illness. “How did two twins born and raised in the city of Boston have such different outcomes?” she said last week. “It started with a story. My brother continues to be my inspiration, he gives me that oomph.” Ms. Campbell faces an uphill battle against her two rivals. Mr. Walsh, who has yet to declare a run for a third term, has received high marks for his handling of the coronavirus, and enjoys the considerable benefits of incumbency in Boston. No incumbent mayor has been defeated in this city since 1949. — Ellen Barry President Trump undermined democracy by refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.
