Ahead of Michigan rally, Trump calls for the return of football and the reopening of the state’s universities. Trump, who often stokes fear, said he played down the virus so as not to ‘scare everybody.’ Biden campaign surrogates lace into Trump over virus revelations: ‘My dad did not panic. But instead, he died.’ Google and Twitter add new safeguards to target election misinformation. The scaled-back Republican stimulus plan fails in the Senate, darkening prospects for a deal before the election. A Monmouth poll shows Biden keeping his lead over Trump nationally and voters worried about election integrity. President Trump ahead of his visit to Michigan Thursday evening for a campaign rally used the White House news conference to call for the return of Big Ten football and to push for Michigan universities to reopen. “We want to see Big Ten football,” he said. “But people are working very, very hard to get Big Ten football back and I’m pushing it, and it will be a great thing for our country and players.” Mr. Trump said that universities should reopen because “it’s much safer for students to live on campus” than to have them at home “spreading the virus to high risk Americans.” “I know the governor will have a lot to say about it, we hope she approves it,” he said. His remarks came a week after the Biden campaign enlisted two football players in Michigan to make the case that the federal government’s poor coronavirus response had left swaths of the Midwest without their favorite football teams. “The leadership in Michigan took it seriously from Day 1, locking things down and saving a lot of lives,” Calvin Johnson, the former Detroit Lions wide receiver, said in a call arranged by the campaign. “What if we had done the same with the federal response? What if we had a leader that led by example, who wears his mask and preaches social distancing?” Mr. Trump also defended his interviews with the veteran journalist Bob Woodward. “I didn’t lie,” he said when asked to explain why he privately described the virus as “deadly stuff” and admitted it was more deadly than “even your strenuous flu” while telling the public the opposite. Mr. Trump bristled at a White House news conference when Jonathan Karl of ABC News asked him: “Why did you lie to the American people and why should we trust what you have to say now?” “Such a terrible question, and the phraseology,” Mr. Trump said. “I didn’t lie. What I said is we have to be calm, we can’t be panicked.” .@jonkarl: "Why did you lie to the American people? Why should we trust what you have to say now?"

President Trump: Such a terrible question and the phraseology. I didn't lie."

And it’s always a serious problem. That doesn’t mean I’m going to jump up and down in the air and start saying people are going to die, people are going to die.” Mr. Trump also picked up a line of criticism that has emerged since excerpts from Mr. Woodward’s book became public on Wednesday: questions about whether it was right for Mr. Woodword to hold damaging revelations for publication months after the interviews. “If Bob Woodward thought what I said was bad, then he should have immediately, right after I said it, gone out to the authorities so they can prepare,” Mr. Trump said. — Annie Karni A day after President Trump argued at a White House news conference that he had played down the lethality of the coronavirus in public because he did not want to “scare everybody,” the president struck a decidedly less reassuring tone on Twitter. “If I don’t win, America’s Suburbs will be OVERRUN with Low Income Projects, Anarchists, Agitators, Looters and, of course, ‘Friendly Protesters,’ ” Mr. Trump wrote Thursday, in another sign of the way he and his campaign have tried to stoke the fears of voters. Fear has been long been central to Mr. Trump’s political persona. He announced his candidacy for president in 2015 claiming that Mexico was sending “rapists” to the United States, used his unusually dark inaugural address to take aim at what he called “American carnage,” and, during the 2018 midterm elections, ordered troops to the southern border in response to a caravan of Central American migrants that he had characterized as an “invasion of our country.” And fear has been a key component of his re-election bid, as the Trump campaign has tried to argue that voters would not be safe in “Joe Biden’s America.” One Trump ad showed a man prying open the door of an older woman’s home with a crowbar. When she reaches 911, a recording tells her, “Leave a message and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can.” But this week, after the damaging revelation that Mr. Trump had told the journalist Bob Woodward that he had knowingly played down the threat of the coronavirus even though he knew that it was life-threatening and vastly more serious than the flu, Mr. Trump found himself insisting that as a leader it was his duty to project confidence, not spread fear. “We don’t want to instill panic,” the president said at the White House on Wednesday. “We don’t want to jump up and down and start shouting that we have a problem that is a tremendous problem.” Mr. Biden, his Democratic opponent, offered a different theory on why the president had played down the threat of the virus. “It was all about making sure the stock market didn’t come down, that his wealthy friends didn’t lose any money,” Mr. Biden said at a campaign stop on Wednesday. The new revelations about Mr. Trump and the virus came from interviews Mr. Woodward conducted with the president for his coming book, “Rage.” Mr. Woodward’s first book on the Trump presidency was called “Fear.” — Michael Cooper Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign on Thursday extended its denunciations of President Trump over revelations that he knowingly minimized the risks of the coronavirus, directly blaming his response to the crisis for the loss of American lives. During a call with reporters addressing Mr. Trump’s admission to the journalist Bob Woodward that he had intentionally played down the virus, the campaign offered a stinging rebuke of the president. “My dad trusted the president,” said Kristin Urquiza, whose 65-year-old father died of the virus in Arizona in June, not long after the state lifted many stay-at-home restrictions. “He listened to the president and followed his advice,” she continued, echoing remarks she made at the Democratic convention last month. “And sure, my dad did not panic. But instead, he died.” Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, also on the call, said Mr. Trump’s decision to play down the virus was “the definition of Donald Trump’s phony populism.” “He sold the American people these lies, then he betrayed them and people died,” Mr. Brown said. Mr. Biden seized on the revelations Wednesday during a campaign stop in Michigan: “He knew how dangerous it was. And while this deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job on purpose. It was a life-and-death betrayal of the American people.” In an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, which was taped on Wednesday and aired on Thursday, Mr. Biden similarly tore into Mr. Trump, saying that he had “caused people to die” and that his decision to play down the virus was “all about making sure the stock market didn’t come down, that his wealthy friends didn’t lose any money.” “He waved a white flag, he walked away, he didn’t do a damn thing,” Mr. Biden said. “Think about it. Think about what he did not do. It’s almost criminal.” Before the Biden campaign call on Thursday, Mr. Trump tried to attack Mr. Biden’s own response to the virus, pointing in a memo to his campaign’s decision to hold an indoor rally in Michigan in early March. The memo did not mention that Mr. Trump also continued to hold rallies even after privately acknowledging the dangers of the virus, or that he held an indoor rally in Oklahoma in June, long after the severity of the virus had become abundantly clear and more than 100,000 people had died in the United States. “While President Trump was already taking decisive action to protect the country in the early months, Biden was saying barely anything about the pandemic and continuing about his campaign as normal,” said the memo, which was sent to reporters minutes before the Biden campaign’s call. Attempting to parry Mr. Trump’s attacks, Bill Russo, the deputy communications director for the Biden campaign, laid out steps Mr. Biden took as the outbreak grew, including an op-ed article Mr. Biden wrote about the dangers of the virus in January. Asked by a reporter about the campaign’s decision to hold an indoor rally in March, on the eve of the Michigan primary, Mr. Russo acknowledged that the rally may have been a mistake but tried to shift the focus back to Mr. Trump. “Maybe those are decisions that, you know, that look a little bit differently in hindsight,” Mr. Russo said. “But maybe if the president of the United States hadn’t been lying about the extent of the crisis that we were facing, we would have had different information to make different decisions.” — Sydney Ember The Russian military intelligence unit that attacked the Democratic National Committee four years ago is back with a series of new, more stealthy hacks aimed at campaign staff, consultants and think tanks associated with both Democrats and Republicans. That warning was issued on Thursday by the Microsoft Corporation, in an assessment that is far more detailed than any yet made public by American intelligence agencies. The findings come one day after a government whistle-blower claimed that officials at the White House and the Department of Homeland Security suppressed intelligence concerning Russia’s continuing interference because it “made the president look bad,” and instructed government analysts to instead focus on interference by China and Iran. Microsoft did find that Chinese and Iranian hackers have been active — but often not in the way that President Trump and his aides have suggested. Contrary to an assessment by the director of national intelligence last month that said China preferred former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. win the election, Microsoft found that Chinese hackers have been attacking the private email accounts of Mr. Biden’s campaign staff, along with a range of other prominent individuals in academia and the national security establishment, including groups like the Atlantic Council and the Stimson Center. Notably, only one of the Chinese targets detected by Microsoft was affiliated with Mr. Trump, a former administration official whom Microsoft declined to name. The Biden campaign said it was “aware of reports from Microsoft that a foreign actor has made unsuccessful attempts to access the noncampaign email accounts of individuals affiliated with the campaign,” and was preparing for the inevitable onslaught of attacks in the coming weeks. While it did not confirm the company’s reporting, it has taken issue with the director of national intelligence’s assessment, issued several weeks ago, that Chinese leaders prefer Mr. Biden over Mr. Trump. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Microsoft investigation also concluded that hackers related to Russia’s G.R.U., the military intelligence unit that oversaw the “hack and leak” campaigns in 2016 that made emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign public, is going to new lengths to hide its tracks. It is routing some of its attacks through Tor, a service that conceals the attackers’ whereabouts and identity, which slowed the effort to identify the hackers. So far, Microsoft officials said they found no evidence that hacking efforts this year were successful, but corporate officials noted that they have limited vision into Russia’s overall operations. They cannot say definitively that no materials were stolen, or what Russia’s motivations may be. That, they said, was the role of U.S. intelligence officials. — David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, abused nearly $6 million in taxpayer funds by hiring Republican consultants to burnish her image through media appearances, profile pieces and events, an investigation by congressional Democrats has found. The investigation found that the consultants hired by Ms. Verma charged up to $380 an hour, far exceeding the salaries of federal employees, who it said were sidelined by the administrator, her aides and the consultants. The report found that one consultant, Pam Stevens, had billed the government nearly $3,000 for work on a “Girls’ Night” in honor of Ms. Verma at the home of Susan Page, the Washington bureau chief of USA Today. Chrissy Terrell, a spokeswoman for USA Today, said that Ms. Page had personally paid for all the costs of the Girls’ Night reception, including $4,025 for catering. She said that the reception was part of a series organized by Ms. Stevens, with events routinely held at the homes of prominent Washington journalists to honor both Democratic and Republican women. Ms. Page was not paid or reimbursed by the federal government for the event, Ms. Terrell said, and had been unaware that the government had been billed for setting it up. The findings of the probe are contained in a report that was prepared by the Democratic staffs of several House and Senate committees. The investigation, which was first reported by Politico, relied on tens of thousands of pages of documents from the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare administrator’s parent agency, and interviews with employees and executives of two consulting firms Ms. Verma used. The consultants had strong Republican ties. One of the consultants circulated a document entitled, “Draft Executive Visibility Proposal Seema Verma,” which targeted magazines for potential profile pieces on Ms. Verma and recommended placing her on high-profile lists of influential people, the investigation found. And the work paid off: Between August 2018 and April 2019, the consultants landed profiles of Ms. Verma in multiple outlets. In a statement from William Pierce, of the communications firm APCO Worldwide, who described himself as “not an official spokesperson,” Ms. Stevens said she was hired by Porter Novelli, a public relations firm with a CMS contract in August of 2018 “to put together a plan to educate media about CMS’s work through meetings” with Ms. Verma. “I was then asked to facilitate meetings with some of the organizations in the plan as well as with thought leaders.” Michael Caputo, a spokesman for the department of Health and Human Services, called the report a partisan smear. “This is just another reckless, politically timed, drive-by hit job on a reform-driven Trump Administration official and, by extension, on President Trump himself,” he said in a statement. The leaders of the Congressional committees who produced the report said in a joint statement: “We believe she should personally reimburse the taxpayers for these inappropriate expenditures.” — Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Elizabeth Williamson Up against a deadline next week for sending out nearly one million absentee ballots, elections officials in the battleground state of Wisconsin were ordered by the state Supreme Court on Thursday to temporarily suspend mailing them so a lawsuit over candidate eligibility could be resolved. The order, a 4-to-3 ruling by the conservative-controlled court, came after Howie Hawkins, the Green Party candidate for president, sued the Wisconsin Elections Commission over having been left off the Nov. 3 ballot. The rapper Kanye West, who was denied a spot on the Wisconsin ballot as an independent presidential candidate, is mounting a separate legal challenge. Both cases have been intensely followed by Democrats and Republicans in the state, which President Trump carried in 2016, with 22,748 more votes than Hillary Clinton. The Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, received 31,072 votes. Many of the one million ballots have been requested by residents seeking to avoid voting in person during the pandemic. Elections officials denied Mr. Hawkins and his running mate, Angela Walker, a place on the ballot after a challenge was mounted regarding the signatures they had submitted to secure a spot. The Green Party candidates have said the challenge was orchestrated by Democrats to keep them off the ballot. The complainant was a Democrat and retired lawyer. The thrust of that challenge was that 2,046 of nearly 3,800 signatures the Green Party candidates collected listed the wrong street address for Ms. Walker, a technicality that left the pair short of the 2,000 names needed to qualify. In the majority opinion, the court ordered the Elections Commission to provide the names and addresses of voters who had already received absentee ballots as of the close of business on Thursday. A commission spokesman said the agency was working to comply with the order and would have no further comment. It was not immediately clear how long the delay in mailing would last. A state law requires absentee ballots to be sent out 47 days before the election. — Neil Vigdor Google and Twitter said on Thursday that they are adding to a growing list of policies meant to combat misinformation ahead of the November election. Google said in a virtual news conference that it will limit what its “Autocomplete” features suggest to users typing search queries related to the elections. The company said it did not want those automated suggestions or predictions to be interpreted as “claims for or against any candidate or political party.” As a result, a search query starting with “donate to” would not suggest either presidential candidate. The company also said it would not provide suggestions for search queries when people are seeking information on voting methods, requirements or the status of voting locations. Whether a suggestion appears or not, Google said users would not be limited in what they can search for. In the 2016 presidential election, supporters of Donald J. Trump accused Google of suppressing negative stories about Hillary Clinton. The claims were ultimately debunked. In addition, Google said that it has expanded the way in which it monitors breaking news with an “intelligence desk” that tracks and identifies “potential information threats.” Google said it has also improved the speed at which its automated systems recognize that a breaking news event, such as a natural disaster, is happening so that the company can be careful to feature prominently information from sources it considers trustworthy. Separately, Twitter said on Thursday that it is expanding its policies regarding election misinformation. The social media service will begin removing tweets that push false or misleading information about laws governing elections or the outcome of a vote. Twitter will also remove disputed claims that could undermine voters’ confidence in the electoral process, like assertions of ballot tampering or vote rigging. The policy will take effect next week, Twitter said. Although Twitter had long taken a hands-off approach to Mr. Trump’s messages, earlier this year the company began enforcing its rules against violative tweets by the president. In May, Twitter added a fact-check label to two of Mr. Trump’s tweets that contained misleading information about mail-in ballots. And last month, Twitter put a warning label on posts in which Mr. Trump falsely claimed that ballot boxes would be a vector for coronavirus transmission and be used for fraud. Last week, Facebook and Twitter added warning labels to posts by Mr. Trump that encouraged Americans to vote twice. Twitter, Facebook and other major companies meet regularly to discuss election security. Recent discussions have revolved around postelection scenarios, including the possibility of attempts by Mr. Trump or his campaign to use social media to delegitimize the results. — Daisuke Wakabayashi and Kate Conger Senate Republicans on Thursday failed to advance their substantially scaled-back stimulus plan amid opposition by Democrats who called the measure inadequate, further darkening the already dim prospects that Congress will enact another economic recovery measure to address the toll of the pandemic before November’s election. After months of struggling to overcome deep internal divisions over the scope of another relief package, Republicans presented a near-united front in support of their latest plan, while Democrats opposed it en masse, denying it the 60 votes it would have needed to advance. The result was never in doubt, and Republicans held the vote largely in an effort to foist blame on Democrats for the lack of progress on a compromise. The 52-47 vote was mostly along party lines, with Democrats uniformly in opposition and one Republican, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, joining them in seeking to block the measure from advancing. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said of the Democrats before the procedural vote, “They can tell American families they care more about politics than helping them,” adding: “Senators who want to move forward will vote yes. They will vote to advance this process so they can shape it into a bipartisan product and make a law for the American people.” The plan, which slashed billions of dollars from the original $1 trillion Republican proposal unveiled in July, included federal aid for unemployed workers, small businesses, schools and vaccine development. But Democrats, who have refused to accept any proposal less than $2.2 trillion, argued that it did little to address the economic devastation of the pandemic. It did not include another round of stimulus checks for American taxpayers or aid to state and local governments, omissions that cut down the overall price tag of the legislation in an effort to appease fiscal conservatives. And while it would have revived weekly federal jobless benefits that lapsed at the end of July, it set them at $300 — half the original amount. Democrats are pressing to reinstitute the full $600 payment. “This bill is not going to happen because it is so emaciated, so filled with poison pills — it is designed to fail,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, on the Senate floor. “It’s insufficient. It’s completely inadequate.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been a point man in negotiations with Democrats on a recovery package, cast doubt Wednesday on whether any agreement could be reached, saying he was not sure whether there was still a chance. “We’ll see,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “I hope there is. It’s important to a lot of people out there.” — Emily Cochrane The forecast for President Trump’s scheduled campaign stop today in Freeland, Mich., is cloudy, appropriately enough. Mr. Trump, a politician who almost always generates his own weather, finds himself trapped in a self-spun tempest just as he tries to recapture the momentum that led to big victories in the battleground Midwest four years ago. He endured one of the most turbulent days of his presidency on Wednesday, with the emergence of two highly dangerous late-campaign story lines — the revelation (via the veteran presidential chronicler Bob Woodward) that he intentionally downplayed the lethality of the coronavirus and an accusation from a whistle-blower that his Homeland Security team had tried to intentionally downplay other threats — Russian interference in the 2020 election and violent white supremacy. Each story has its distinct narrative. But they both converge on a single, damning conclusion, in the view of his critics: that Mr. Trump puts his own welfare, political and personal, above the interests of the country. “I wanted to always play it down,” the president told Mr. Woodward, as the pandemic built in intensity early this year. “I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.” Later, Mr. Trump seized on the “panic” part, saying he was simply trying to marshal national morale at a fearful moment. The counterpoint: “He knew how dangerous it was,” said Mr. Trump’s opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., during his own stop on Wednesday in Michigan, a state that the president won in 2016 but where Mr. Biden now holds a modest yet stable polling advantage. “It was a life-and-death betrayal of the American people.” A few hours after the Woodward excerpts were published, word came that Brian Murphy, the former head of the Homeland Security Department’s intelligence branch, had said in a complaint that he was ordered to stop producing assessments on Russian interference. He added that the Homeland Security secretary, Chad Wolf, had ordered him not to disseminate a report on a Russian disinformation campaign to denigrate Mr. Biden’s mental health because it “made the president look bad.” Mr. Trump’s appearance in Michigan will take place at the M.B.S. International Airport outside Saginaw. As president, Mr. Trump has shown a preference for staging events at airplane hangars — they are weatherproof, don’t expose him to heckling crowds and, above all, they allow him to get in and out quickly. He likes to do the same with news cycles. Will the stories linger, or be swept away in the amnesia winds of Trump-era politics? Mr. Trump is banking on the latter. By Wednesday night, he was furiously working to change the subject, unveiling his list of second-term Supreme Court finalists, celebrating the life of the baseball great Roberto Clemente (the Puerto Rican vote is critical in Florida’s I-10 corridor) and announcing on Twitter that the Navy would “NOT” be canceling its contract with Catholic chaplains. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan laced into Mr. Trump Thursday as he prepared to travel to her state. “His failure to act has cost so many lives and sent our economy in a tailspin,” she said during her weekly briefing on the coronavirus. “It’s just devastating to hear that. The biggest threat to the American people is the American president right now.” — Glenn Thrush and Kathleen Gray A national poll released Thursday shows Joseph R. Biden Jr. maintaining his lead over President Trump as the campaign enters its last two months, adding to a growing number of surveys that have suggested that the state of the race is largely unchanged since the party conventions. The poll, conducted by Monmouth University, shows Mr. Biden ahead of Mr. Trump by nine percentage points among registered voters, 51 percent to 42 percent. The survey results are almost identical to those in a survey conducted by Monmouth in early August, before the conventions. Thursday’s poll also found Mr. Biden with a seven-point lead among likely voters, which tracks with national polling averages at this stage in the race. On average, Mr. Biden has been holding onto a lead of seven to eight percentage points among likely voters nationwide, down slightly from a lead of eight to nine points heading into the conventions. The Monmouth survey also found only two percent of likely voters undecided. The poll was conducted by telephone from Sept. 3 to 8, surveyed 758 registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. National polls can provide a broad window into the state of the race, but it is Electoral College votes that decide the outcome. Some recent polls have shown Mr. Biden’s lead slipping in battleground states like Florida and Pennsylvania. The Monmouth poll also asked voters about their confidence in the integrity of the 2020 election. Mr. Trump has railed for weeks against mail voting, which is expected to be used by tens of millions of voters amid the coronavirus pandemic, claiming without evidence that the practice is rife with fraud. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have said that the Russian group that interfered in the 2016 presidential election is meddling again. Thursday’s survey found only about six in 10 voters very or somewhat confident that the election will be conducted fairly. Roughly one in four said they were “not too confident” and 13 percent said they were “not at all confident.” The poll found that 52 percent of voters thought it somewhat or very likely that the Trump campaign would try to cheat if it was necessary to win; 39 percent of respondents said the same about the Biden campaign. — Matt Stevens Ahead of President Trump’s rally in Michigan on Thursday night, Democrats are planning to use his own words to skewer him. The Democratic National Committee is dispatching a mobile billboard truck to MBS International Airport in Freeland, Mich., where the rally will take place. The truck will play a brief audio clip of Mr. Trump speaking to the journalist Bob Woodward about the coronavirus: “I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down.” As his words ring out, the mobile billboard will display statistics showing the virus’s toll. The back of the truck will carry a blunt message: “Trump Lied. Americans Died.” Democrats, including Joseph R. Biden Jr., have long attacked Mr. Trump over his handling of the virus. But the president’s comments to Mr. Woodward are giving the party a new and powerful way to raise the issue. “While Trump will continue to use these rallies to lie to the American people,” said Lily Adams, a spokeswoman for the D.N.C., “we’re using his own words to remind Michigan voters that when Americans needed the facts during this pandemic, Donald Trump lied to them, costing an untold number of lives and causing economic devastation.” — Thomas Kaplan AD WATCH The newly-released recordings of President Trump admitting in interviews with Bob Woodward that he played down the threat of the coronavirus are prime fodder for Democratic attacks. Priorities USA, a major Democratic super PAC, was the first to cut them into a digital ad. Since the pandemic exploded in late March, Democratic groups and candidates have seized on the coronavirus as a top political advertising issue, and nearly $40 million in TV ads over the past 30 days have focused on Covid-19, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. Many Democratic attacks have followed the same formula as the new ad from Priorities USA: audio of Mr. Trump downplaying the virus set against an exponential growth chart of deaths. But the new ad set against the same graphics, using recordings from Mr. Woodward’s interviews with the president, drives home a darker message: that rather than handling the virus incompetently, Mr. Trump engaged in a cover-up, hiding information about how lethal the pandemic was from the American people. The ad begins with audio clips of Mr. Trump’s interview with Mr. Woodward, but transitions to public comments Mr. Trump has made, splicing together a clip of him saying “the coronavirus” with one saying “this is their new hoax.” The Trump campaign has taken issue with this edit before, claiming it distorts what the president said. His full comments, following an accusation that the Democrats were “politicizing” the coronavirus, were: “They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.” The ad will run in both English and Spanish in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Arizona. Priorities USA said it will run in other battleground states as well, but did not specify which. Voters across the country have been inundated with ads replaying Mr. Trump’s comments downplaying the virus earlier this year, both as the screens show them rising death counts and their everyday lives continue to be upended by the pandemic. But Priorities USA, and likely other groups in the near future, are betting that newly revealed comments from Mr. Trump indicating he was intentionally downplaying the virus and hiding its true danger from voters will have a greater impact. — Nick Corasaniti Trump supporters heading to the president’s rally in Freeland, Mich., Thursday night were given some unusual notes on how to prepare. “The suggested attire is casual,” according to an email from the Trump campaign to people who registered online for tickets to the event. “Official Trump Campaign merchandise is permitted. Please do not wear ANY OTHER campaign merchandise (i.e. local, state, or federal campaigns).” The guidelines were unusual, according to Democratic and Republican strategists who have worked on other national campaigns. All presidential campaign managers experience friction with local candidates and lawmakers who want speaking slots ahead of a national candidate coming to town. But campaign strategists said it was strange to prohibit signs or T-shirts supporting down-ballot candidates that the leader of the party is supposed to help elevate — and doubly odd to put the directive in writing, they said. Tim Miller, who worked for former Jeb Bush’s Republican presidential campaign in 2016, called the dress code “cultish.” Mr. Trump may often brag about the power of his endorsement to help other candidates win local races, but the dress code indicates the extent of his aversion to seeing the spotlight on anyone but him. Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign communications director, said that only approved Trump-branded signage or apparel was permitted at campaign events. “It’s the President’s campaign,” he said, by way of explanation. Other campaign aides said the dress code was designed to give the crowd a consistent look and branding across the board. “The President enjoys enthusiastic support at his events of the kind Joe Biden can only dream of,” Mr. Murtaugh added. — Annie Karni Donald Trump Jr. told an interviewer this week that his father was reserving judgment on Kyle H. Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old Illinois resident accused of killing two protesters in Kenosha, Wis., last month — and suggested the shootings were the actions of an impetuous “young kid.” The interviewer, the former “Bachelorette” contestant Rachel Lindsay, asked the younger Trump why his father had not condemned Mr. Rittenhouse. “We’re waiting for due process. We’re not jumping to a conclusion,” Mr. Trump, who was promoting his new book, “Liberal Privilege,” said on the “Extra” entertainment show. Then he mused: “If I put myself in Kyle Rittenhouse, maybe I shouldn’t have been there — he’s a young kid, I don’t want 17-year-olds running around the street with AR-15s — maybe I wouldn’t have put myself in that situation, who knows? But we all do stupid things at 17 — ” “That’s a little bit beyond stupid,” Ms. Lindsay interjected. “Really stupid, fine,” Mr. Trump continued. “But we all have to let that process play out.” Mr. Rittenhouse, a Trump supporter who attended one of Mr. Trump’s rallies in January, faces charges including first-degree intentional homicide in connection with the deaths of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, who were protesting the shooting of Jacob Blake. Ms. Lindsay also asked Mr. Trump about the Black Lives Matter movement. “It’s a very good marketing message, it’s a great catchphrase,” said Mr. Trump, adding that he agreed with the movement’s broad goals, but not its underlying ideology. — Glenn Thrush President Trump heads to Michigan after a day of potentially damaging revelations from Bob Woodward’s forthcoming book. Joe Biden seized on the news.
