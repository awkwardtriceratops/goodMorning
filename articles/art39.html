Voters flock to the polls as Georgia opens early voting. Biden builds on his economic populist message and courts Trump voters in Ohio. Independent Midwestern voters who turned to Trump in 2016 now prefer Biden, a poll finds. California investigates reports of illegal ballot-drop boxes that could be used for fraud. In a rare revelation for a lawmaker, Senator Gary Peters says his ex-wife had an abortion to save her life. Kamala Harris rebukes Republicans for rushing Judge Barrett’s confirmation process. High school students are stepping up to fill poll worker shortages. As Trump returns to campaigning, his aides preview a final sprint. Biden’s most-aired ad last week promises a president who listens. Fired-up voters across Georgia descended upon polling sites in record-breaking numbers on Monday —  the first day of early, in-person balloting — as state and local officials reported glitches with the state’s new and troubled touch-screen voting system. In Atlanta and its suburbs, long lines of socially distanced voters began forming in the pre-dawn hours, after a federal judge rejected a last-minute attempt to replace the $104 million system with paper ballots until its problems could be sorted out. “It’s an awesome thing. We thought we were going to get here early,” said Norman Robinson III, as he stood in a line snaking more than a half-mile long outside his early voting site at The Gallery at South DeKalb, a mall near Atlanta. “My parents were jailed in college during the 1960s for exercising their rights to vote,” added Mr. Robinson, an education administrator at a school specializing in science technology and math. “This is in my blood, to make sure I honor and continue their fight for voices to be heard.” A spokesman for Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, said Monday that the state was seeing “record turnout for early voting because of excitement and enthusiasm about the upcoming election.” But the lines were not entirely the result of voter fervor. As lines formed at State Farm Arena in metropolitan Atlanta, problems emerged with electronic equipment there, according to Jessica Corbitt-Dominguez, a spokeswoman for Fulton County, which includes the city. Voters complained on Twitter of 90-minute delays as multiple machines had to be rebooted. Aklima Khondoker, the Georgia director of the voting rights group All Voting Is Local, said that electronic poll pads on which voters check in had been creating problems around the state. “We’ve seen over 10 counties where this is happening,” she said. In a ruling Sunday night, U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg acknowledged the equipment had problems, but held that it was too late to revamp the voting system. The state did not have the capacity “to turn on a dime and switch to a full-scale hand-marked paper ballot system,” she wrote, rejecting arguments by the Coalition for Good Governance who said that potential security holes in the system endangered the election’s integrity. Georgia’s new voting system is a hybrid. The machines do not actually store ballots; voters fill out their preferences on the touch-screen, the results are printed out and scanned, and then they are stored in locked boxes. Judge Totenberg directed election officials to beef up efforts to review ballot images to ensure that software does not miss votes before expected runoff elections in January. Jill Biden, the wife of the Democratic nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr., appeared in DeKalb County on Monday with Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia lawmaker who founded a voting rights organization, to encourage Democrats to vote early. “I want everyone, if you don’t already have one, to make a plan to vote,” Dr. Biden told a socially-distanced crowd gathered in a parking lot. “One vote could make the difference between winning and losing a precinct. One precinct could win this state, and this state could decide our future for generations to come.” Georgians did not seem to need much coaxing to show up, however. “I wish I had brought a chair,” said Everlean Rutherford, 39, a government employee, who stood in line for almost hour outside of her polling place in Marietta before casting her ballot. “One of the poll workers said this is the most that they’ve ever had for early voting,” she said.  — Stephanie Saul and Glenn Thrush TRANSCRIPT “The fact is the president can only see the world from Park Avenue. I see it from Scranton. I see it from Claymont for real. You all know what I’m talking about. You all see it from Erie. That’s why my program to build back better is focused on working people.” “And I’m not going to raise taxes on anybody making less than 400 grand. But, but, you won’t pay a penny more. But those making more than that, I’m going to ask them to finally begin to pay their fair share. I’m going to ask the big corporations and the wealthy to begin to pay. Ninety-one of the Fortune 500 companies today pay zero tax. You hear me? Zero tax. How many of you pay zero tax?” “So I’m going to raise — the money I’m going to raise, we’re going to allow us to invest in working people and grow the middle class back and make sure everyone comes along this time. My plan is about making the kinds of investments that are going to stimulate economic growth.” “We’re going to fix water pipes — pipelines, replace lead pipes, upgrade treatment plants. We’re going to construct 1.5 million new affordable housing units. We’re going to build a hundred billion dollars rebuilding our schools. We’re going to retrofit — which we started our administration — four million buildings, including advanced heating and cooling systems. There’s going to be such a race to job creation for unions that you’re not going to believe it.” “The fact is that every time the word climate change comes up, Donald Trump thinks hoax. Every time it comes up, I think jobs. Let me be clear: No matter how many lies he tells, I am not, not, not banning fracking, period.” Almost four years after Ohio so fully embraced President Trump that many Democrats wrote the state off for the 2020 election, Joseph R. Biden Jr. headed there on Monday, aiming to energize the Democratic base and to court white working-class Americans who supported Mr. Trump last time, powering his wins in Ohio and across the Industrial Midwest in 2016. Mr. Biden promoted his economic message to “Build Back Better” in a speech in Toledo, pressing an economic populist message and casting his opponent as an out-of-touch plutocrat who repeatedly betrayed union workers. “The system’s rigged,” Mr. Biden said, cribbing from language used by both Mr. Trump and some on the left, as he ripped into Mr. Trump’s very limited tax payments. “We’re going to change it.” Mr. Biden,  who spoke Monday outside the United Auto Workers’ Local 14 union hall, has been leaning into a more populist message in recent weeks, pitching his campaign as Scranton versus Park Avenue, a reference that contrasts his hometown in Pennsylvania with Mr. Trump’s privileged background. He is later slated to attend a voter mobilization event in Cincinnati. Mr. Biden’s trip to Ohio is his latest effort to cut into the margins of Mr. Trump’s base. After the first presidential debate, in Cleveland, Mr. Biden launched a train tour that took him through eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, regions that swung heavily in Mr. Trump’s direction in 2016. But many Democrats still view flipping Ohio as a stretch compared with other places, and the state has not been a central focus of Mr. Biden’s team throughout the race, though officials stress that they want to create as many pathways to electoral victory as possible. “Biden has a real opportunity,” said David Pepper, the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, going on to reference the state’s Democratic senator, who has managed to win statewide despite Republican gains. “If he can come anywhere close to how Sherrod Brown did in those areas, he has a good chance of winning Ohio.” — Katie Glueck and Nick Corasaniti The Senate confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump’s nominee to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court, began along predictable partisan lines, with Democrats emphasizing abortion and health care and Republicans sticking to their prepared rebuttals even when they did not correspond to what Democrats were saying. Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including Senators Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Josh Hawley of Missouri, accused Democrats of attacking Judge Barrett on the basis of her religion, suggesting that they were anti-Catholic and wanted to impose an unconstitutional religious test for Supreme Court nominees. But no Democrat on the committee mentioned religion at all. Instead, the Democrats focused on how Judge Barrett might rule on cases involving major issues like abortion and the Affordable Care Act. And, as they have done consistently since Justice Ginsburg died last month, they accused Republicans of hypocrisy for holding the hearings at all after blockading President Barack Obama’s election-year nominee in 2016. Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota argued that confirming Judge Barrett could amount to overturning the Affordable Care Act, whose constitutionality the court will consider in a case scheduled for oral arguments just a week after the election. Others noted the prospect of reversing Roe v. Wade, which anti-abortion and abortion-rights groups alike expect that Judge Barrett would vote to do. And Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut argued that Judge Barrett should commit to recusing herself from any cases related to the election: the elephant in the room given that Mr. Trump’s efforts to delegitimize mail-in voting have made legal challenges to the results more likely, and because some Republicans have expressly argued that she must be confirmed before the election precisely so that a full nine-member court can rule on such challenges. The threat of the coronavirus hung over the hearings on Monday, especially given that two members of the Judiciary Committee tested positive this month. Judge Barrett and most senators on the committee who appeared in person wore masks, except during their statements, but the chairman, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, generally did not. Senator Mike Lee of Utah, one of the members who tested positive, removed his mask when it was his turn to speak. — Maggie Astor, Nicholas Fandos and Emily Cochrane Donald J. Trump’s surprise victory in 2016 centered on the Midwest — particularly the ambivalent voters there who chose him at the last minute as the lesser of two evils. But many of these voters, often political independents, soured on the president’s leadership early in his term. And according to a pair of newly released New York Times/Siena College surveys from Michigan and Wisconsin, Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been consolidating his support among these same voters in the final weeks of the race — putting him in a commanding position and forcing President Trump to make up last-minute ground in the region that carried him to victory four years ago. Mr. Biden leads the president by 10 points in Wisconsin, twice his margin from a Times/Siena poll there last month, and by eight points in Michigan. In both states, Mr. Biden leads by close to 20 points among independent voters. He is also well ahead of Mr. Trump among those who said they supported a third-party candidate in 2016. Partly because he has lost so many people who voted for him out of sheer antipathy to Hillary Clinton, the president’s support now runs slightly stronger among members of the Republican Party than it does among all voters who cast a ballot for him in the last election. Across recent Times/Siena surveys of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Iowa and Ohio, Mr. Trump retained the support of just 87 percent of those who voted for him in 2016. Mr. Biden held onto considerably more of Mrs. Clinton’s supporters. Both Wisconsin and Michigan could be on track for very high voter turnout this year, based on a comparison of the polls’ findings with actual requests made to date for mail-in ballots. In Wisconsin, the number of absentee ballots already requested represents roughly 43 percent of all votes expected to be cast there this year, according to state estimates. But only 24 percent of Wisconsin voters told the pollsters they planned to vote by mail. If the poll figure turns out to be anywhere near accurate, that would mean an even greater increase in turnout than state officials were already predicting. It also provides potentially good news for Democrats, who make up an outsize share of mail-in voters. Similarly, in Michigan, the number of mail ballots requested exceeds 50 percent of expected turnout, even though just 38 percent of the state’s voters told Times/Siena interviewers they planned to vote by mail. In both states, the Times/Siena polls found Republicans more than twice as likely as Democrats to plan on voting in person on Election Day. This all sets up a complex voter-turnout calculus on Election Day, when Republicans will potentially have far more get-out-the-vote work to do than Democrats, a reversal of the typical scenario.  — Giovanni Russonello and Nate Cohn California election officials are investigating the placement of unofficial drop boxes for mail-in balloting in Los Angeles, Fresno and Orange counties — illegal sites that could be used to identify and eliminate the ballots of unsuspecting voters. California’s secretary of state, Alex Padilla, sent a memo late Sunday urging county elections officials to find and remove unauthorized boxes in order to “guarantee the security and chain of custody of vote-by-mail ballots deposited.” In his memo, Mr. Padilla reminded local officials that creating an illegal polling site was a felony punishable by up to four years in prison. “Operating unofficial ballot drop boxes — especially those misrepresented as official drop boxes — is not just misleading to voters, it’s a violation of state law,” Mr. Padilla, a Democrat, said in a statement. “Never hand your ballot over to someone you don’t trust,” he warned voters. “Official county drop boxes are built with specific security protections, and ballots are retrieved only by designated county personnel.” Mr. Padilla’s office received a report on Saturday that a metal box with a misleading sign suggesting that it was an official site to drop off mail-in ballots had been placed in front of the Freedom’s Way Baptist Church in Castaic, northwest of Los Angeles. And last week, a supporter of the Orange County Republican congressional candidate Michelle Steel posted a picture of himself on Twitter dropping off a ballot at a gray metal cabinet onto which someone had taped a sign reading “Official Ballot Drop off Box.” It was not an official site, elections officials said. In the post, the supporter of Ms. Steel, Jordan Tygh, a regional field director for the California Republican Party, flashes a thumbs-up over the caption, “Doing my part and voting early,” according to the Orange County Register, which first reported on the use of the boxes. The post has since been deleted. The paper also reported that the Fresno County Republican Party had posted on its website a list of “secure” ballot collection locations — including the party headquarters and local gun shops — that were not on the state’s list of official county drop box sites. The page has been removed. The secretary of state’s office has not alleged that operatives from either party have engaged in the selective harvesting of ballots placed in the illegal boxes. Messages left with the state and the Fresno County Republican Party offices were not immediately returned. — Glenn Thrush and Jennifer Medina Senator Gary Peters of Michigan, a Democrat facing a competitive race for re-election in Michigan, became one of only a handful of members of Congress on Monday to share a personal experience with abortion. In an interview with Elle magazine, Mr. Peters said that in the late 1980s, his wife at the time, Heidi, had an abortion at four months’ gestation because the pregnancy was not viable and her life was in danger. Her water had broken, Mr. Peters told Elle, leaving the fetus with no chance of survival. When she did not miscarry naturally, she became ill and was told that without an abortion, she would lose her uterus and would be at risk of dying from sepsis. She had to go to a second hospital to get an abortion, Mr. Peters said, because the first hospital had an anti-abortion policy and would not make an exception. “My story is one that’s tragically shared by so many Americans,” Mr. Peters wrote on Twitter. “It’s a story of gut-wrenching and complicated decisions — but it’s important for folks to understand families face these situations every day.” Mr. Peters is one of only two Democratic senators up for re-election who are vulnerable this year, the other one being Senator Doug Jones of Alabama. His Republican challenger, John James, is a vocal opponent of abortion, which has become a bigger issue in this year’s elections since Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death increased the chances of a Supreme Court majority against Roe v. Wade. Mr. James, whose campaign did not immediately comment on Monday, has not directly answered questions about whether he supports exceptions in situations where the woman’s life is in danger. — Maggie Astor Just days after facing off against Vice President Mike Pence at the vice-presidential debate, Senator Kamala Harris was again in the spotlight as she delivered her opening remarks on the first day Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. It was one of the most high-profile appearances in the political career of Ms. Harris, a former prosecutor who was first elected to federal office just four years ago, and who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination before being chosen as the party’s vice-presidential nominee. Appearing remotely to deliver her opening remarks, Ms. Harris largely stuck to the party line, lashing Senate Republicans for rushing through a Supreme Court nomination even as millions of Americans were still suffering from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. “This hearing should have been postponed,” Ms. Harris said. “The decision to hold this hearing now is reckless and places facilities workers, janitorial staff and congressional aides and Capitol police at risk. Not to mention that while tens of millions of Americans are struggling to pay their bills, the Senate should be prioritizing coronavirus relief and providing financial support to those families.” And just as Democrats before her did, she elevated the Affordable Care Act as a crucial issue, warning Americans that the health care law was at stake. “I do believe this hearing is a clear attempt to jam through a Supreme Court nominee who will take health care away from millions of people during a deadly pandemic that has already killed more than 214,000 Americans,” she said. In her dual role as a member of the Judiciary Committee and vice-presidential nominee, Ms. Harris has faced pressure from Democrats to carry the mantle of the Democratic ticket while also upholding her reputation as a skilled cross-examiner. Already, several Senate Republicans used the hearing on Monday to criticize the Democrats who are calling to expand the size of the Supreme Court if Judge Barrett is confirmed — a particularly thorny issue for Ms. Harris and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who have both refused in recent weeks to answer whether or not they support the proposal. — Sydney Ember With many traditional volunteers — especially older people who have long been the main pool of poll workers — reluctant to spend hours in direct contact with large groups, thousands of high school students and other young people are stepping forward. “I’m sure from whatever side of the political spectrum someone comes from, they can agree that currently in our country and in our world, there are a lot of problems that need solving,” said Jacob, 17, who plans to work at a polling place in Milwaukee on Election Day. “For me, that’s being a poll worker.” The pandemic has only accelerated the impending need to replace those who have long worked the polls, 58 percent of whom in 2018 were 61 or older, a group for whom the virus is a high risk. In an effort to prevent long lines at polling locations across the country, some jurisdictions have offered hazard pay to compensate poll workers. And even before the pandemic, 70 percent of jurisdictions reported in 2018 that they faced at least some difficulties recruiting the necessary number of poll workers. Many states and counties allow 16- or 17-year-old high school students to help others cast their ballots even if they cannot do so themselves. Some have additional requirements, such as a minimum grade point average, to qualify. Tired of simply posting on social media, young people have volunteered in droves after many watched the chaotic primary election season that shed light on the demand for new poll workers. Ben Hovland, the chairman of the Election Assistance Commission, the federal agency that provides support to state and local election authorities, called the new generation one of the potential “silver linings” of an election season filled with new challenges. The critical need caused by the pandemic prompted an outpouring of volunteers, many of whom would have never known otherwise about the impending poll worker crisis, he said. — Hailey Fuchs Officials with President Trump’s campaign told reporters on Monday that the final stretch of the race would be more frenetic than ever for the president as he tries to make up time he lost battling the coronavirus. Ahead of Mr. Trump’s return to the campaign trail Monday in Florida, with trips to Pennsylvania, Iowa and North Carolina scheduled for the three following days, aides previewed what they presented as a mad sprint to Nov. 3 and said they had no concerns about the candidate’s health or stamina. “This morning, in our morning conversation, he was getting on my case for not having enough rallies,” said Jason Miller, the campaign’s senior strategist. He said the president’s schedule would include “two to three events a day, and that will grow as we get closer to Election Day.” Bill Stepien, the campaign manager, who himself was returning to work just 10 days after testing positive for the virus, said the president’s packed calendar “reflects his health and well being. It’s going to be a big shot in the arm for the campaign.” Mr. Stepien said that he had been free of symptoms for the entire 10 days and that his decision to return to work was in line with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He did not say whether or not he had tested negative for the virus. “We take a lot of precautions at headquarters here,” Mr. Stepien said. The pronouncement came as Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff who has been around the president in recent days, was spotted on Capitol Hill refusing to speak to reporters through a mask. The White House physician has not released results of Mr. Trump’s most recent test, which he says he took on Friday, though the president said on Sunday that he had tested “totally negative.” That may not be enough time to protect people Mr. Trump comes in contact with. Anyone who tests positive for the coronavirus should quarantine for at least 10 days after showing symptoms, to avoid spreading the infection to others, according to the C.D.C. The agency recommends a longer period of isolation for people who have had severe cases. Overall, the Trump campaign team expressed confidence, even as polls show Joseph R. Biden Jr. with significant leads in several battleground states. Mr. Miller also said that recent cuts in television advertising in key states like Ohio were not a sign of concern over cash flow, but rather indicated the campaign’s confidence there that they felt they could pull down ad buys with just three weeks to go in the race. He said the campaign was making new ad buys in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida and Nevada this week. And he reminded reporters that a spending advantage in 2016 did not deliver a win for Hillary Clinton. One weakness Mr. Stepien acknowledged parenthetically was the president’s dip with older voters, one of his most crucial constituencies. Mr. Stepien said that “every campaign changes from election to re-election” and claimed that losses with older voters would be “offset by gains in certain voting populations,” including Black and Hispanic voters. — Annie Karni AD WATCH As early voting begins, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s most-aired television ad last week was a grab-bag of his 2021 agenda that also featured his willingness to listen and consult with “the nation’s top health experts” on the coronavirus, drawing an unstated contrast with President Trump. The ad is a bit of a mish-mash. With seemingly disparate elements of the Biden agenda strung together over 60 seconds, the ad amounts to a list of some of the more politically persuasive messages for Democrats in general — cutting taxes for the middle class, creating jobs, managing the pandemic — and highlights Mr. Biden’s willingness to listen to all sides. The ad begins with the coronavirus, touting how Mr. Biden followed the advice of experts, before pivoting to his role in listening to doctors and patients when crafting a health care plan, making sure to highlight the key Democratic point that the party will protect coverage of those with pre-existing conditions. The ad then pivots to the economy, before touting Mr. Biden’s promise to cut taxes for the middle class while raising them for the wealthy and to create “18 million jobs in his first term.” “For Joe, it’s never been about ego,” the narrator says. Mr. Biden has listened closely to experts in crafting his own response to the coronavirus, sharply limiting his travel and working to ensure proper social distancing at his events when on the trail, in contrast to Mr. Trump, who has mostly disregarded recommendations from health experts. Mr. Biden’s ad pledges that his economic plans would create 18 million jobs in his first term, but job creation is mostly done in the private sector, and such job gains are notoriously hard to achieve. The ad also vaguely mentions “raising wages by as much as $15,000 a year” without specifying for whom or why that number is featured. Just about everywhere that is a 2020 battleground. The ad had nearly $5 million in airings in the last week, with some of the heaviest rotation in Philadelphia, Phoenix and Detroit. The ad is a positive spot about Mr. Biden that casts him as a Democrat who cares about the economy and who listens to the experts on the pandemic. — Shane Goldmacher At the Church of God of Prophecy in Phoenix, hundreds come each Sunday for two hours of worship in Spanish. They share passages from the Bible, sing and embrace each other tightly. The evangelical congregation, led for nearly 25 years by Pastor Jose Rivera, is nearly all Latino, the vast majority with roots in Mexico. They are not unlike the people President Trump tried to demonize from the outset of his first campaign, or all that different from those he is trying to keep out with his border wall and hard-line immigration policies. But they do not agree on Mr. Trump — some see him as a savior, others as a predator. By Mr. Rivera’s estimate, somewhere between a quarter and a third of his congregants support Mr. Trump, a rate that is echoed in national polls. When Pastor Rivera looks at his congregation, he sees a microcosm of the Latino vote in the United States: how complex it is, and how each party’s attempt to solidify crucial support can fall short. There are not clear ideological lines here between liberals and conservatives. Conversations with dozens of members of Rivera’s congregation and with other Hispanic evangelicals around the country over the course of the year make clear that religious identity is often a more fundamental part of their political affiliation than ethnic identity. “I believe that he’s just doing the courageous things based on Scripture, and making our country become what it should become and bring us all our blessings,” said Carlos Ruiz Esparza, 52, a steadfast supporter of the president who regularly worships with Mr. Rivera. Latinos are projected to be the largest minority to vote in the presidential election this year, with 32 million eligible voters who could play a decisive role in who wins the White House. And while Hispanic evangelicals make up a small slice of the electorate, they are key to Mr. Trump’s consistent support from roughly one-third of Hispanic voters, particularly in battleground states like Florida and Arizona. Mr. Rivera, who has been a bishop for the last three decades, said, “They try to present him as the messiah, but if he is the messiah, he is not doing what we are supposed to do.”  — Jennifer Medina The two biggest groups on the anti-Trump Republican landscape, the Lincoln Project and Republican Voters Against Trump, have become multimillion-dollar operations that conduct their own sophisticated data research and polling. Then there’s the Bravery Project, led by Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman from Illinois; Stand Up Republic, which recently introduced a spinoff, Christians Against Trumpism & Political Extremism; the Republican Political Alliance for Integrity and Reform, known as Repair and led by two former top Trump administration officials; and 43 Alumni for Joe Biden, made up of members of President George W. Bush’s administration. And don’t forget about the short-lived Right Side PAC, founded by Anthony Scaramucci, the former White House communications director, and Matthew Borges, a former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. The group formed in June with the mission of turning out Republican voters for Mr. Biden in battleground states, but  shut down after Mr. Borges was arrested on federal corruption charges. Mr. Scaramucci has since given the money to the Lincoln Project and teamed up with Repair. The crowded, competitive arena of party-less anti-Trump Republicans is, in some ways, a product of the fact that not having a party means not having any clear leader. Groups with similar missions engage in little coordination or sharing of resources. The groups’ leaders say this is all fine, and organic. Mr. Schott’s competitors in the conservative anti-Trump space say there is little downside to another player spending $1 million on advertising criticizing the president. But what is less clear is whether more coordination among anti-Trump Republicans — who harbor deep worries about what would happen to the country if Mr. Trump were re-elected, and are eager to be seen as having been on the right side of history — would better serve the collective project to unseat the president. “The Never Trump movement is having a moment,” said Lucy Caldwell, a Republican strategist who advised Mr. Walsh’s failed primary challenge to Mr. Trump this year. “But on the whole, the last four years have been a lot of throwing spaghetti against the wall and seeing what sticks, and a lot of head chefs in the kitchen.” — Annie Karni Tommy Tuberville, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama, is running in large measure on his experience in college football’s Southeastern Conference, known as the S.E.C., where he coached Auburn University. But he has had experience with another S.E.C., the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other financial regulators. A review by The New York Times found that Mr. Tuberville, who leads Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat, in the polls, has a history of involvement with at least three people who were later convicted of financial fraud in what were described as Ponzi schemes. Mr. Tuberville was largely seen as a victim and never charged with a crime. In two episodes, Mr. Tuberville lost millions of dollars. A third was more minor, when Mr. Tuberville and his wife, Suzanne, bought a home through a company created by a lawyer who was later convicted of running a real estate-related Ponzi scheme. The Times review included a small charitable foundation created by Mr. Tuberville, finding that its tax records indicated that less than a third of its proceeds went to the veterans’ causes it was set up to advance. The foundation also had bookkeeping issues. The review raised questions about Mr. Tuberville’s judgment and financial acumen. While he has said on the campaign trail that he hoped to serve on the “banking finance” committee — the Senate has separate, and prestigious, banking and finance committees — he has at times undercut his own qualifications. Regarding an ill-fated hedge fund venture, he once told a reporter, “I’m not smart enough to understand all the numbers.” In a statement, Mr. Tuberville’s campaign largely deflected financial questions. “Doug Jones, Chuck Schumer, and other liberal, Swamp Democrats are spreading lies in an attempt to smear Coach Tuberville’s career, accomplishments, and charitable service,” the statement said, adding, “Coach is focused solely upon serving his fellow Alabamians and faithfully representing their conservative values, beliefs, and desires.” In one fraudulent scheme, Mr. Tuberville was an investor and a 50/50 owner of a financial firm, TS Capital, that was shut down by state and federal regulators. A 2012 complaint from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said that Mr. Tuberville’s partner, John David Stroud, racked up trading losses of nearly $1.2 million and misappropriated nearly $2.3 million for “car payments, travel expenses, entertainment and retail purchases.” As one of Mr. Stroud’s lieutenants put it, the firm had “the optics of a Ponzi scheme.” — Danny Hakim President Trump will hold a rally in Florida and Joe Biden will campaign in Ohio as the confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett get underway. Read live updates.
