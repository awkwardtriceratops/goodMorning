We’re getting to the time of election season when we receive a dozen or more poll results a day, so let’s start by zooming out a bit and taking in the big picture. Just scan down the rightmost column of the poll table below, which shows the difference between a given poll result and the outcome of the 2016 election in that state. To win, all Joe Biden needs is +1D in every state. Today you’ll mostly see numbers like +7D, +8D, +9D and higher still. That’s consistent with the national polls showing him up by 10 points — a +8D over Hillary Clinton’s two-point victory in 2016. Blue North Carolina. If we start to zoom in a bit, the place where the race snaps into focus most clearly is North Carolina, where a Times/Siena poll Wednesday found Mr. Biden up by four points. The poll is part of a recent North Carolina survey boomlet: eight North Carolina polls released over the last 48 hours. They collectively show Mr. Biden ahead by a narrow but consistent margin of around three points. This isn’t the first time this cycle that so many pollsters have decided to weigh in on a state at the same time. There was a big wave of polls in Wisconsin and Minnesota after the Republican convention, and then a big wave of polls of Pennsylvania before and after the first debate. It shouldn’t be too surprising: Many firms are motivated by the same considerations, and in this case I’d guess the revelations about the Democratic Senate nominee Cal Cunningham’s texts to a woman who wasn’t his wife were the precipitating factor. Mr. Cunningham nonetheless led in every poll over this period. We can focus on the details of these polls all day, but the main takeaway here is clear. North Carolina may be one of the six core battleground states, but it’s the most conservative one. Mitt Romney won it in 2012, and President Trump won it by four points in 2016. If the president is clearly behind in his best core battleground, he’s in real trouble. Or if you prefer: If he’s in trouble here, he’s probably in bigger trouble elsewhere, like Pennsylvania. Eyes-a-poppin’ in Georgia. Yesterday I said we shouldn’t raise our eyebrows at every outlier that comes our way, but as you zoom in even further I’d guess your eyes probably caught a striking Quinnipiac result in Georgia, which showed Mr. Biden up by seven points. This poll is a bit of an outlier, but not as far as Quinnipiac polls are concerned. They’ve shown some spectacular results for Mr. Biden in recent weeks, particularly in the South. They had Mr. Biden leading by 11 points in Florida and trailing by just one point in South Carolina, which Mr. Trump won by double digits in 2016. I don’t know exactly what’s going on here. If you peer into the crosstabs across the recent Quinnipiac polls, it’s clear they have Mr. Biden doing extremely well — unrealistically well, compared with just about every other poll — among white voters without a degree across the South. But that’s more like identifying the symptom rather than the cause. What’s clear is that these polls seem to systematically tilt toward Mr. Biden. That’s probably not intentional, but it does mean you should take it with a grain of salt. Blue Georgia? Of course, even if you took seven points off Mr. Biden’s lead in the Quinnipiac poll, it would qualify as a good result for him. And indeed, Data for Progress and SurveyUSA polls showed Mr. Biden tied or up by two points in Georgia. Those count as good and realistic results for him, and they’re hardly the only polls to show him well positioned. Indeed, Mr. Biden leads by two points on average in the state, making him a fairly clear if still narrow favorite to win the state if the election were held today. Democrats have salivated over the prospect of turning Georgia blue for the first time since Bill Clinton won it in 1992, particularly after Stacey Abrams narrowly lost a contentious governor’s race two years ago. But Mr. Biden’s progress in the polls here isn’t much of a surprise. Mr. Trump fared poorly in Georgia in 2016; he won the state by only five points. That made Georgia less than two points to the right of North Carolina, which everyone considers a serious battleground state. The state is growing rapidly, and its diverse and well-educated population has long posed an obvious risk to the Republicans, even before Mr. Trump’s victory put the state a mere seven points to the right of the nation as a whole. Now that national polls show Mr. Biden running eight points ahead of Mrs. Clinton, why wouldn’t Mr. Biden have the edge in the state? A bad day for the G.O.P. Senate. We usually focus on the presidential race, but it’s worth taking note of a few Senate results: as mentioned earlier, Mr. Cunningham leads in North Carolina; Steve Bullock, the Democratic candidate, leads in a quality poll of Montana, and Democrats appear highly competitive in both Georgia Senate contests. Together, it puts the G.O.P. path to a majority in quite a bit of trouble. What about the rest of the country? Well, we got a poll or two from most everywhere else, and just about everything was in line with what we thought heading into the day: a big Biden lead nationwide, a comfortable lead in the most hotly contested Midwestern battlegrounds, and a more modest edge in the Sun Belt battlegrounds, like Florida or Arizona. Thursday, 1 p.m. Eastern. A Times/Siena poll in South Carolina. We’ll announce the link here first. (If you are signed up for notifications, using the module at the top of the page, you’ll be the first to know.) Friday, 1 p.m. Eastern A Times/Siena poll of Alaska. It’s a notoriously tough state to poll, but so far I’m happy with the geographic and demographic distribution of the responses we’ve gotten, with one exception: no responses yet in Utqiagvik, formerly known as Barrow. Perhaps tonight we’ll do better. State of the race: Another bad day for the president, and for the likelihood of a Republican Senate majority in 2021. By Nate Cohn Joe Biden leads President Trump by four points in a crucial battleground. My colleagues Reid J. Epstein and Matt Stevens have the story. By Nate Cohn Oct 14 A running table of all the presidential polls released today, with newest entries first: By Nate Cohn More clarity in North Carolina. We got a lot of polls today, from more than a dozen states, including from most of the top battlegrounds. You might think such a bounty of polls would yield new insights about the state of the race, or help answer questions we have three weeks from the election. For the most part, you would be wrong. There were certainly a few eyebrow-raising results, but if you took all of the polls together, you wound up in about the same place you started the day: a significant lead for Joe Biden. Clearer picture in North Carolina. Of the top-tier battleground states, North Carolina is probably thought to be the toughest nut for Mr. Biden to crack. On Tuesday, we received four polls of the state, and they suggested he leads President Trump by about three points on average — pretty close to our polling average. Maybe even more important was the result in the Senate race, where the Democrat, Cal Cunningham, continued to hold a considerable lead across all four surveys, even after he admitted to sending flirtatious text messages to a woman who was not his wife. The G.O.P. path to control of the Senate is narrow if Mr. Cunningham continues to hold a clear advantage. Biden’s lead in U.S.C. panel reaches a high. The U.S.C./Dornsife poll is out every day, so we don’t usually discuss it much. But on Tuesday, Mr. Biden held his largest lead yet — 13 points — since the poll began releasing data in mid-August. The U.S.C./Dornsife poll is a panel, so most shifts ought to be because of changes in the attitudes of voters, not changes in the composition sample. Because the pollsters are recontacting the same voters every two weeks or so, you can get a particularly sound comparison if you look back to the result from that long ago. Back then, Mr. Biden was up by just 10 points in the survey. And what happened two weeks ago? The first presidential debate. A lot from Morning Consult. In addition to its poll in North Carolina, Morning Consult released a host of state and national polls, and they’re mostly in line with polling averages — if arguably a bit better for Mr. Trump, at least nationwide. Morning Consult is representative of a new group of state polls this election: online polls that weight by how respondents recall voting in the 2016 election. So, if a state voted for Hillary Clinton by two points, the poll respondents who say they voted for her should outnumber those who say they voted for Mr. Trump by two. Weighting on recalled past vote is often seen as a bit of a crutch for having poor data (I could probably interview a bunch of folks in New York City who voted for Mrs. Clinton by an 80-20 margin; weight them to Clinton 48, Trump 46; and have a perfectly plausible “national poll” result.) But this cycle, the approach does seem to be yielding fairly plausible results — not just from Morning Consult, but from a long list of less prolific firms employing a similar approach. Wait, Biden’s up how much in what poll? Often people ask me about surprising results from obscure polling firms, like the West Virginia poll from Research America Inc., or a national poll from Opinium, which both showed great results for Mr. Biden. I understand why people are curious about results like these, but I don’t spend too much time thinking about them. We know from a lot of other surveys that Mr. Biden probably isn’t up 17 points nationwide, or approaching 40 percent support in West Virginia. And that big picture is … Mr. Biden is ahead, and his lead is either holding steady or widening. By Nate Cohn Oct. 13 A running table of all the presidential polls released today, with newest entries first: By Nate Cohn State polls are starting to look like national ones. If there’s a question about Joe Biden’s commanding lead in the polls, it’s whether he’s doing quite as well in the battleground states (and therefore the Electoral College) as he is in national surveys. On Sunday, I wrote that there were at least some signs of a split between the two groups of surveys. Today, there were fewer of those signs. Times/Siena in Michigan and Wisconsin. If we may say so ourselves, the big polling news of the day was probably our New York Times/Siena surveys in Michigan and Wisconsin, where Mr. Biden led by eight and 10 points. There’s no sugarcoating these results for President Trump. His deficits were fueled largely by voters who said they had flipped to Mr. Biden after voting for Mr. Trump in 2016. Together, the results show Mr. Biden running about 9.5 points ahead of Hillary Clinton’s performance in 2016. That’s about the same margin that the national polls have been showing since the first debate. The Times/Siena poll in Wisconsin found Mr. Biden running five points ahead of his lead in our previous survey, the biggest shift we’ve seen in our post-debate polling so far. Biden inching forward in Reuters/Ipsos state polls. Last month, the Reuters/Ipsos polls counted as some of Mr. Trump’s best results in the battlegrounds. They weren’t even so bad for the president a week ago, after the debate. But the newest Reuters/Ipsos polls in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin show Mr. Biden up seven points in each state, representing a two- and one-point increase in his lead since their last polls, immediately after the presidential debate. Like the Times/Siena results, these are bad numbers for the president, and they’re fairly consistent with the national surveys. Taken together, it’s a meaningful — if not definitive — strike against the possibility that Mr. Biden has made relatively few gains in the battleground states. Another day without a Trump comeback. There was no sign of a Trump comeback in the national polls, either. Yahoo/YouGov and RMG Research polls were unchanged since their previous surveys, which both showed eight-point leads for Mr. Biden soon after the first debate. IBD/TIPP showed Mr. Biden up nine percentage points, up from a three-point lead after the first debate. At least some of Mr. Biden’s gains in the IBD/TIPP poll may be attributable to methodological changes, but there’s no way around the fact that the poll was once a bright spot for the president, and now it’s not. U.S.C. Dornsife’s national tracking poll continues to show Mr. Biden’s lead expanding, and it now shows him with his largest lead since the Republican convention. One thing to remember is that this poll has a 14-day field period, so there are still interviews in this data from before the debate. Mr. Biden’s lead might keep growing until those days have been cycled out entirely. State of the race: The president faces a daunting deficit with just over three weeks to go, and every day that goes by without some kind of good news for him, whether in the headlines or in the numbers, is another lost opportunity at a comeback. By Nate Cohn Biden maintains a solid lead in two key battlegrounds. We have the story over at The Upshot. By Nate Cohn Oct. 12 A running table of all the presidential polls released today, with newest entries first: By Nate Cohn There’s a split in national and state polls. Only a few firms released surveys over the weekend. What we did get was not good news for the president. Another double-digit lead. An ABC/Washington Post poll found President Trump trailing by 12 points on Sunday, a result we would have called an outlier two weeks ago but now fits within the balance of national post-debate polling. After the 12-point margin, the next most important thing about the ABC/Post poll might be when it was conducted: entirely after the president’s release from the hospital, and partly after the vice-presidential debate. We’ll have to wait for confirmation from other polls, but this result suggests that neither event did much to help the president get back in the race. Spotting the state-national split. One emerging pattern has been that the president isn’t doing quite as poorly in state polls as he is in national ones, and that trend continued this weekend. An easy way to see this national/battleground split: Compare the numbers in the far-right column with the other numbers in the tables above; the column shows how the poll findings compare with the 2016 election result. As you can see, in today’s national polls, Joe Biden is running about 10 points ahead of Hillary Clinton’s election result, but the battleground state polls are typically shifting several points less than that, which is why you see lots of 6s and 7s in that column above. That smaller difference qualifies as relatively good news for Mr. Trump. If he’s down by only six points in Michigan, then you can still imagine how a late break his way and another polling error might help him squeak out a win. That’s not so different from what happened four years ago. But if he’s down by 10, as the national polls suggest, he will need something that goes well beyond what happened four years ago. State of the race. President Trump is running out of time to mount a comeback, so every day that the averages stay where they are is a bad day for him. Up next. On Monday at 1 p.m. Eastern, we’ll release the results of Times/Siena polls of Michigan and Wisconsin. Later in the week we’ll have polls of North Carolina, South Carolina and Alaska. By Nate Cohn Better polls in the Sun Belt for Trump. The polling lull continues. Many organizations like to begin polls after a debate — the vice-presidential debate was Wednesday — and they won’t wrap up for a few days. But the data we did get today hinted at the possibility that things are starting to level off for the president. The bleeding is stopping? After a week of beyond awful numbers for President Trump, Friday’s polls suggest that, at the very least, his standing isn’t getting any worse. Joe Biden’s lead in the U.S.C. tracking poll fell to 10.5 percent from 10.9 percent. That’s not much, but the poll has a 14-day field period — meaning that one-day changes will be pretty modest, even if there’s a significant change in the race. The new Ipsos poll shows Mr. Biden up by 12 percentage points among likely voters, unchanged since its survey from Oct. 2-6. And a Landmark Communications poll in Georgia shows Mr. Trump up by two points, one week after it showed Mr. Biden up two in the state. Now, that could easily prove to be statistical noise. But there’s a chance we look back and see this, along with the day’s other polls, as one of the earliest signs that the president had begun to reverse some of his post-debate and post-coronavirus-diagnosis losses. Better polls for Trump in the Sun Belt. The Landmark poll wasn’t the only survey to show the president leading in a Sun Belt battleground. Three other polls, of varying quality, also showed the president ahead in Georgia, Texas and Arizona. There’s not much need to dig deep on these polls individually, though I will note that the University of Georgia poll is pretty similar to Times/Siena polls methodologically. These results are not necessarily much for the president to brag about, but it’s certainly a different story than polls showing Mr. Biden ahead by 12 points or more nationally would seem to imply. What about Redfield & Wilton? You might have noticed surveys from Redfield & Wilton Strategies. This is a British polling outfit, and it joins a few other international firms — like the Montreal-based Leger  — in dipping its toes into the U.S. polling scene this cycle. The Redfield & Wilton polls appear to be conducted online, like most British polls, but there isn’t a ton of methodological detail here. Anyway, I wouldn’t dismiss them out of hand, even if there isn’t much cause for any great confidence either. State of the race. Mr. Biden retains a commanding lead, but for the first time in a while the day’s polls weren’t borderline apocalyptic for Republicans. It’ll be interesting to see whether this is just a blip, or whether it foretells a return to something like the state of play before the president’s coronavirus diagnosis. By Nate Cohn Oct. 9 A running table of all the presidential polls released today, with newest entries first:  The New York Times Biden leads by 10 in our average. The day after a presidential (or vice-presidential) debate is usually a pretty quiet period for polling. Many pollsters like to start a poll after a debate is over, so today is a nice opportunity to take stock of the race. Biden’s double-digit lead. Our national polling average on Thursday shows President Trump trailing by 10 percentage points — his largest deficit of the campaign. It sounds bad for him, but there have actually been several national polls in recent days showing him faring much worse, including today’s Data for Progress poll showing him trailing by 15. Joe Biden’s nine-point lead in the Morning Consult poll counts as one of the president’s best national polls in recent days. It’s not just Biden’s margin. We usually focus on the difference between the two candidates, but it’s worth taking note of vote share from time to time, and right now Mr. Biden’s share of the vote is up to 52 percent in our average. That’s a pretty big deal. If the numbers held, Mr. Trump would still lose the national vote by at least five points even if all of the undecided vote went his way. Some of Mr. Biden’s gains seem as if they might be durable. If his rise could mainly be attributed to a decline in Mr. Trump’s support, rather than an increase in his own, you could assume that most of Mr. Trump’s former supporters would ultimately return to the president’s side during a better news cycle. But that’s not all that has happened here. It’s hard to stress how rare it is for a presidential candidate in the modern era to have such a high share of the vote at this stage. Just go back through the last decade of Real Clear Politics averages, and you’ll find there’s only one instance when a candidate eclipsed Mr. Biden’s 52 percent  over the final few months of a race: Barack Obama on the day of the 2008 election. The state polls were weird. Maybe it’s not too surprising that most of the polls we got today — during a survey dead spot — were fairly odd. Most were from partisan firms, and it’s usually worth taking those with a grain of salt. One of the few nonpartisan results — from Insider Advantage in Florida — was released exclusively to the Fox News commentator Sean Hannity and sponsored by Matt Towery Sr., a former Republican in the Georgia House of Representatives. So that’s not exactly what you’d think of as a nonpartisan poll. Another nonpartisan result, a St. Anselm College poll of New Hampshire, had far too many college graduates represented in its sample, which can tend to bias a poll toward Democrats. All considered, there weren’t many state polls worth thinking too much about. State of the race: Mr. Biden took a commanding lead after the first debate and the president’s coronavirus diagnosis. It will be a few more days until we can get a sense of whether the vice- presidential debate or Mr. Trump’s release from the hospital has helped the president claw back into the race. By Nate Cohn Behind a day of dismal polling for the president. On Tuesday, I noted that when you consider how few days remain in the race, it was probably President Trump’s worst day of polling so far this campaign. Today, there were a few points of relatively good news for him from high-quality pollsters. But here’s the thing: Even the “good news” for Mr. Trump is still quite bad. Well, that’s a lot. When you get so many polls on a day like this, it’s somewhat helpful to consider three things: How bad were the worst polls for the president, how good were the good polls, and where does the average stand? The president’s bad polls were really, really bad. For the second straight day, nearly every national survey showed the president down by 10 points or more. Even Rasmussen, often the most favorable pollster to the president, showed Joe Biden ahead by 12 points nationwide. The president’s worst state polls showed Mr. Biden tied or ahead in states worth well over 400 electoral votes. Quinnipiac surveys showed Mr. Biden ahead by a (not terribly believable) 11 points in Florida, by 13 points in Pennsylvania and by five points in Iowa. There were polls by Democratic-leaning firms showing Mr. Biden way ahead in North Carolina, ahead in Texas, and highly competitive in Missouri (down by only two points in a state Mr. Trump carried by 19 points in 2016). In comparison, the surveys showing Mr. Biden leading narrowly in Iowa and Ohio and tied in Texas looked entirely reasonable. The president’s “best” polls. The president’s very best polls today were basically what average polls for him looked like a few weeks ago, or worse. His best national survey was a nine-point deficit in YouGov/Economist — nothing to brag about. There were a few semi-bright spots for him in the state polling, like a six-point deficit in Nevada in a Times/Siena poll or a five-point deficit in Wisconsin, according to Marquette Law. Maybe you could count the two-point deficit in Arizona from Ipsos, but here again that would have basically just been an average result a month ago. A few weeks ago, we used to note that the race was teetering between being highly competitive and a landslide. On a given day, the president’s best polls would show a tight race in Pennsylvania and Florida, but also with Mr. Biden within striking distance in Georgia and Ohio. If the polls were off by a couple of points, either way, you could have a pretty close contest or a blowout. By that same logic, the race today is teetering between a straightforward loss for the president and the worst defeat of an incumbent president since Herbert Hoover. More about Marquette. It’s worth taking a second to contemplate this Wisconsin number from the Marquette Law poll. It’s the first result from a telephone survey in Wisconsin in several weeks, it’s from one of the best pollsters in the country, and the result is somewhat closer than we would have guessed. In most of our discussions about the various roads to 270 electoral votes, we have mostly supposed that Wisconsin is part of Mr. Biden’s path of least resistance after several high-quality pollsters showed him solidly ahead in early September, just after the Republican convention. Since then, the national polls have shifted two to three points in Mr. Biden’s favor, so we would have guessed he was even further ahead today — maybe even up by eight to nine points. Instead, the Marquette poll found an essentially unchanged race, with Mr. Biden up five points among registered and likely voters. That’s two points better for Mr. Trump among registered voters, compared with early September, and one point better for Mr. Biden among likely voters. Now, it’s been a while since we’ve had many telephone surveys of Wisconsin, so we don’t have a particularly robust average in the state. Most of our assumptions about the race are based on polls that are fairly out of date, mainly conducted during or in the immediate aftermath of the unrest in Kenosha. So it’s possible that the president’s standing is relatively resilient in Wisconsin. If the president is indeed holding up well in Wisconsin, that would help keep one of his best remaining hopes alive: the chance that he can scratch out a victory in the Electoral College while losing the national popular vote by a much wider margin than he did four years ago. There are limits to what the president can realistically hope to pull off here — winning while losing the national vote by more than five points would be a real stretch. But if Mr. Trump really were down only by five points in Wisconsin, even as he trails by 10 nationwide, it would be one important step toward keeping that possibility alive. We’ll have a Times/Siena poll in Wisconsin early next week, so that ought to help clarify things. A daunting deficit. You could go nuts trying to decide whether to believe the really, really bad polls for Mr. Trump or the merely bad polls for him, and that’s where the poll average comes in. By our estimates, he faces an increasingly daunting deficit with under a month until the election. He trails by nearly 10 points nationwide. Can things still change, starting with the vice presidential debate? Yes. There’s still a month left, and just think about all that’s happened in half that time: Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death, The Times’s Trump tax story, Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination, a presidential debate, and now the president’s coronavirus diagnosis, hospitalization and eventual release. For all the talk that “nothing matters,” the news has definitely had a material effect on the polls. It’s quite possible that the news could still turn back in the president’s favor. He’s out of the hospital. The confirmation hearing of Judge Barrett could go well for him. A strong debate performance by Mike Pence and a poor one by Kamala Harris could help change the conversation. Yes, it’s pretty unlikely that a perceived debate victory by Mr. Pence would sway many voters to the president. But it could help the president in the polls. The news, after all, has been quite bad — and bad news can affect poll results, even without really causing deep-seated changes in public opinion. As we discussed yesterday, it can make the supporters of one candidate less likely to take a survey. It can also make them less likely to voice their support for a candidate they’re almost certain to vote for in the end — not because they’re “shy,” but because they really do feel troubled about their candidate in ways that leave them unwilling or unable to commit to support him at a challenging moment. It might lead some undecided voters to throw up their hands and back a candidate whom they won’t feel inclined to back just a few days later. If that’s true — and remember that we’re still talking at the margins — it’s possible that some modicum of good news for Mr. Trump could help bring about a more neutral news environment and help him a bit in the polls. That could be as simple as a solid or even neutral debate performance tonight by Vice President Pence. By Nate Cohn A close race in Ohio, and Biden leads by six points in Nevada. My colleagues Reid J. Epstein and Isabella Grullón Paz have the story. By Nate Cohn Oct. 7 A running table of all the presidential polls released today, with newest entries first: By Nate Cohn A day when even the good news was bad for him. It has been four days since the announcement that President Trump contracted coronavirus, so we’re only now beginning to get a picture of where the race stands after his diagnosis. When you consider the number of days left in the race, it’s probably the worst day of polling the president has had. The extent of the bad news for the president. Most national surveys Tuesday showed Joe Biden ahead by at least 10 percentage points nationwide, including a daunting 16-point advantage in a CNN/SSRS poll. Then there was Mr. Biden’s double-digit lead in Pennsylvania in a long-awaited Monmouth poll. (I wrote about the poll this morning. The short version is: If it’s even remotely in the ballpark, it’s a big blow to President Trump’s chances at re-election.) The president’s good news was still pretty bad. Not every poll was as bad for Mr. Trump as the CNN/SSRS survey was. But go down the list and take the president’s best one: down eight nationwide, tied in Florida, down four in Pennsylvania, down one in Arizona, tied in North Carolina. These results would have seemed pretty typical two weeks ago. Now they count as his best, and they’re not even enough for a lead in any of those states. (In our table of averages, he leads only in Texas among the battleground states.) The polling picture is still blurry. It’s pretty clear that the president’s position has deteriorated significantly over the last 10 days or so. What’s less clear is why. Pollsters like to say that the polls are a “snapshot,” but that’s not quite right. Most surveys are conducted over a few days, not in an instant, and all surveys represent voters at the time the interview was conducted — almost always a few days before the poll is released. A three- or four-day exposure is usually pretty reasonable in public opinion research, but right now events are just moving too fast. We’ve been getting a big news development every day or two. We simply don’t have enough data to say how much of the president’s weakness can be attributed to his debate performance, his coronavirus diagnosis or his hospitalization. Is it real? If you’ll permit a small technical diversion, poll analysts almost always debate whether big polling shifts are real, or just the result of something called “partisan nonresponse bias.” That term is a fancy way of saying that the supporters of one candidate might be more or less likely to respond to a poll. In general, Democrats and Republicans are equally likely to respond to surveys, controlling for their demographic characteristics. But there’s plenty of evidence that response rates can briefly fluctuate in response to a big news event. This can contribute to familiar shifts like a “convention bounce” or even a swing after a debate, like right now. So it’s fair to ask: Is this real? Are Trump supporters simply reluctant to pick up the phone after a tough week for their candidate? It’s hard to rule it out completely, but it’s worth noting that the telltale signs of partisan nonresponse bias just aren’t there right now. One natural thing to check is the party identification of the respondents in a sample. If it shifts a lot along with the horse race, that could be a sign that the poll moved mainly because of partisan nonresponse. But I don’t see much signs of a big shift in party identification today. To take one example: The Democratic Party ID advantage in the CNN/SSRS poll increased to five points from three points in its prior poll, while Mr. Biden’s margin went up to 16 points from eight points. If partisan nonresponse were the cause, you would expect the Democratic advantage to shift more than that. Even more remarkable: The Monmouth poll in Pennsylvania found the Democratic Party identification advantage shrinking to plus-one from plus-five, but found Mr. Biden gaining eight points. That’s just not what you’d expect to see if partisan nonresponse were the factor. Another thing to check is if there’s a shift in the polls that use lists of registered voters. Pollsters using these lists can make sure they’ve reached the right number of registered Democrats and Republicans in a state. The Monmouth poll, which showed Mr. Biden doing so well in Pennsylvania, falls into this category. So does the NBC/WSJ poll, which showed Mr. Biden up by 14 points and said it found no signs that Republicans weren’t picking up the phone. (Our Times/Siena polls are in this category, too.) The big picture: Mr. Biden is in an increasingly strong position, but only time will tell whether it’s durable in this fast-paced news environment. By Nate Cohn A recent weak spot seems to have become a strength for him. If you’ve been reading along here, you know we’ve been waiting for a Monmouth poll in Pennsylvania. Today, we got it: Joe Biden is leading by eight or 11 points, depending on the turnout scenario. We average the two results for our poll averages, including the table above. If the Monmouth result is even remotely in the ballpark, it’s a big blow to President Trump’s path to re-election. The context: Over the last 10 days or so, Mr. Biden has had a great run of polls in Pennsylvania. An ABC/Washington Post survey, two New York Times/Siena polls and one by  CBS/YouGov found Mr. Biden up by seven to nine points. This growing consensus would be big, if true. Mr. Biden has been polling well in Michigan and Wisconsin. If Pennsylvania were also in his column, along with the states won in 2016 by Hillary Clinton, it would give Mr. Biden a clear advantage in states worth more than 270 electoral votes, the number needed to win. There had been reason to be cautious as this string of good news began for Mr. Biden: Until about 10 days ago or so, Pennsylvania was a rare bright spot for the president. In August before the Republican convention, Muhlenberg College showed Mr. Biden up by just four points. Then Monmouth showed him up by just one or three points, depending on its two likely-voter screen options for turnout estimate. With that backdrop, it was hard to say whether Mr. Biden’s recent strong poll results were simply a reflection of more favorable pollsters, or a shift in his favor. The consequence: Now, Mr. Trump’s best recent poll in Pennsylvania — the last Monmouth poll — has become his worst. Together, Mr. Biden has led in six straight high-quality polls of Pennsylvania by at least seven percentage points. This is about as clear a picture as we get in state polling. It gives him a clear advantage in states worth more than 270 electoral votes, and therefore in the race for the presidency. By Nate Cohn Oct 6 By Nate Cohn (Algebra optional.) Monday was a fairly slow day of polling. So slow, in fact, that some of the most interesting news of the day came from a poll that hasn’t even been fully released yet. The handful of results we did receive confirm that the president’s coronavirus diagnosis has done little to win him sympathy or reshape the race. If anything, things have moved a point or two toward Joe Biden since the first debate. Today’s national polls: Decent for Biden. A Morning Consult poll conducted online after the president’s coronavirus announcement showed Mr. Biden up nine points nationally. That’s more or less where Morning Consult polls have been for months, but it is a point or two better for Mr. Biden. Similarly, RMG research showed Mr. Biden with an eight-point lead. The state polls weren’t much better for Trump. A Times/Siena survey found Mr. Biden with an eight-point lead in a state (Arizona) that President Trump carried by nearly four points in 2016. Needless to say, that’s a miserable result for the president. If there’s any consolation for him, it’s that it’s actually a point closer than the nine-point deficit he faced in the last New York Times/Siena poll in Arizona. Meanwhile, Ipsos found Mr. Biden up by six points in Wisconsin and by five points in Pennsylvania. Those results aren’t so terrible for Mr. Trump compared with other polls, but the trend line is favorable for Mr. Biden, who improved over his prior result in both states. In fact, the last Ipsos result in Pennsylvania — Biden+3 — was one of Mr. Trump’s best results of the month. Tomorrow, a big one in Pennsylvania. On Tuesday, we expect a Monmouth poll out of Pennsylvania. It’s a big one. Last time, it found Mr. Biden up by just three points in the state, one of the president’s best results of the month. If Monmouth shows a larger lead for Mr. Biden — as recent Times/Siena, ABC/Washington Post and YouGov polls have — Mr. Trump’s path to the presidency will plainly be in serious jeopardy. We might have gotten a clue of tomorrow’s result in the form of a Monmouth poll on Monday of New Jersey’s Second Congressional District, which flipped from Barack Obama to Mr. Trump in 2016. Mr. Biden led by four or five points in the poll, depending on turnout estimates, and while we are quite sure that New Jersey and Pennsylvania are different places, a strong result for Mr. Biden in New Jersey’s Second may bode well for his standing in neighboring Pennsylvania. Today’s CNN/SSRS national poll hints at a terrible result for Trump tomorrow. CNN released part of its new national survey Monday, and it had a terrible number for the president: a minus-17 approval rating. It didn’t release the result of the question testing Mr. Biden versus Mr. Trump, but if you dig a little deeper, it’s pretty clear Mr. Biden’s up by double digits. How can you tell? Well, CNN released a 16-page document of crosstabs from the poll today, which lets people like me look at how various subgroups — men, women, college graduates, white people and so on — answered individual questions. And if you scroll to Page 10 of that document, as I obviously did, you’ll see Table 008 Question A1, which lists Mr. Trump’s approval rating for different groups of voters. The president’s approval rating was broken down into two groups: Trump voters and Biden voters. With that information — the president’s overall approval rating, and his approval rating among Biden and Trump supporters — we can get a pretty good estimate for the results of the poll Tuesday. It can’t be perfect — for one, we don’t know how many undecided voters were in the survey or whether they approved of the president, and rounding is a minor issue — but we can definitely get in the ballpark. Take the president’s 40 percent approval rating. According to the poll, the president is getting positive job approval from 3 percent of Biden voters and 92 percent of Trump supporters. If, for the moment, we stipulated that there were no undecided or third-party voters, we could make a rough guess of the results of the survey. For those who like math, the algebra is straightforward: 40 = 92x+3(1-x), where x is the president’s share of the vote in the poll. If you solve for x, then the president has 41.6 percent, with 58.4 for Mr. Biden. Run the same math on the president’s disapproval, and you get Biden 57.3, Trump 42.7. Those are 17- and 15-point leads. Now, there are some undecided voters, of course, and we don’t know whether they approve or disapprove of the president. But CNN doesn’t usually have many undecided voters, so we’re almost certainly talking about a double-digit lead for Mr. Biden. And if you take the average of their last two polls, you’d guess it’s quite a bit larger than a 10-point Biden lead. Maybe even 15. We’ll find out the real result soon enough. That’s obviously a bit of an outlier, but … NBC/WSJ had it Biden plus-14 on Sunday. By Nate Cohn Biden leads by eight points. Joe Biden holds a significant lead in Arizona after the first presidential debate, a new survey released Monday showed, as Arizona Republicans face dissent in their ranks and an influx of Democratic-leaning voters in one of the nation’s fastest-growing states. In the New York Times/Siena College survey, Mr. Biden leads President Trump by eight percentage points in Arizona, 49 percent to 41 percent. The poll began on Thursday, hours before President Trump announced he had contracted the coronavirus. Mr. Biden fared significantly better in interviews conducted on Friday and Saturday, after controlling for the demographic characteristics of the respondents. Two nights of interviews in one survey, however, are not enough to make any confident claims about the effect of the president’s diagnosis on public opinion. The result is better for Mr. Biden than his average lead of four points from other recent Arizona surveys, but it is essentially unchanged from the last Times/Siena poll of the state in September, which showed him leading by nine points, 49 percent to 40 percent. Right or wrong, Times/Siena surveys of Arizona have tended to show bigger Biden leads than other surveys of Arizona this cycle. The findings confirm that the Republican grip on Arizona is in jeopardy, after it spent decades as a bastion of Sun Belt conservatism. It was the home of Barry Goldwater and John McCain, but the state’s Republican vote has fractured during the Trump era. The president became embroiled in high-profile battles with the state’s former Republican senators, Jeff Flake and Mr. McCain, who died in 2018. An influx of new voters has deepened the party’s woes, threatening to turn another state blue in the once reliably Republican interior West. In 2016, Mr. Trump won the state by 3.5 percentage points, a significant decline in Republican standing since Mitt Romney’s nine-point win in the 2012 presidential election. In the 2018 midterms, the Democratic Senate candidate, Kyrsten Sinema, defeated Martha McSally by more than two points. In the race for U.S. Senate next month, the Democrat Mark Kelly leads Ms. McSally — appointed to the Senate seat once held by Mr. McCain — by 11 percentage points, 50-39. A shift among Republican voters in the state toward Democrats appears to represent about one-half of the Republican challenge in the state, while the changing electorate makes up the other half. Mr. Biden leads by two percentage points, 46-44, among likely voters with a validated record of voting in the 2016 election — a group that reports voting for Mr. Trump by six points in 2016, 47-41. Meaningful defections. The president has suffered modest but meaningful defections among the voters who supported him four years ago. Today 87 percent of those voters back him, while 6 percent do not. Registered Republicans back Mr. Trump, 82-9. Mr. Biden, in contrast, has the benefit of a more unified Democratic base. Hillary Clinton voters back Mr. Biden, 93-2, while registered Democrats back Mr. Biden, 90-3. Mr. Biden also holds a 55-16 lead among validated 2016 voters who said they didn’t back one of the major-party candidates four years ago, a potentially crucial shift in a state where Mr. Trump won with just 48 percent of the vote. Mr. Biden’s gains among minor-party voters would be enough by themselves to eliminate Mr. Trump’s advantage from 2016. Big lead among those who didn’t vote in 2016. At the same time, Mr. Biden holds a 22-point lead among likely voters in Arizona who did not participate in the 2016 election. These voters make up a surprising 32 percent of the electorate. That’s the second-highest such group in any Times/Siena survey so far this year, trailing only nearby Nevada — the nation’s fastest-growing state. Such a huge number of new voters might seem hard to believe, or indicative of the potential for unprecedented turnout. But it is nearly identical to the 30 percent of currently registered 2016 voters in Arizona who were not validated voters in the state in 2012, according to voter file data from L2, a nonpartisan political data firm. For many of these people, the idea of voting isn’t a hypothetical. Many of them probably cast ballots in other states. Others have already revealed their high levels of political engagement: One-third of the new voters already participated in the 2018 midterm elections, and they represent 10 percent of the 2020 likely electorate. In our poll, they backed Mr. Biden by a margin of 64 percent to 29 percent. Produced by Rumsey Taylor </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
