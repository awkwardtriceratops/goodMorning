As Trump and Biden criss-cross the Midwest, the key could be ‘a purple region within a purple state.’ Daily schedules: Trump and Biden in Minnesota and Wisconsin, Harris in Texas, Pence in Arizona. More than 9 million people have voted early in Texas, surpassing the state’s total 2016 turnout. Biden and Obama will hold their first joint rallies on Saturday in Detroit and Flint, Mich. Trump remakes his election night plans. An appeals court says Minnesota must set aside ballots received after 8 p.m. on Election Day. Donald Trump Jr. said virus deaths had fallen to ‘almost nothing’ as over 1,000 died in the U.S. With President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. converging today on Wisconsin — a state the president won in 2016 by roughly 22,000 votes, or less than a percentage point — the key to winning the state could lie in places like the Fox Valley. The valley, a three-county stretch from Green Bay to Oshkosh, is the most politically competitive region in one of America’s most hotly contested states, where Mr. Trump, who is holding a rally in Green Bay this afternoon, has trailed steadily in polls. Democrats tend to focus their Wisconsin efforts on turning out voters in the liberal cities of Milwaukee and Madison — Mr. Biden is speaking at the airport in Milwaukee this evening — while Republicans concentrate on the conservative suburbs ringing Milwaukee. But it is often the Fox Valley where elections are won or lost. And this year, there is a new wild card: the coronavirus is rampaging through the Fox Valley, with new case counts averaging nearly 600 a day. The three counties — Brown, Outagamie and Winnebago — all backed Mr. Obama in 2008, and two of the three narrowly went for Mitt Romney in 2012 before they all backed Mr. Trump four years later. And in 2018, all three counties backed Gov. Scott Walker, a conservative Republican who narrowly lost his bid for a third term as governor, and Senator Tammy Baldwin, a liberal Democrat who coasted to re-election. “It’s a purple region within a purple state, and purple regions swing back and forth depending on the times,” said Senator Ron Johnson, an Oshkosh Republican. The combination of old factory towns and rural voters who have migrated to the Republican Party, college towns and small cities becoming increasingly Democratic, and Catholic voters inclined to back Democrats as long as they aren’t too strident on abortion rights has made the region a real presidential battleground. It is the headquarters of the John Birch Society and the cradle of McCarthyism — Senator Joseph McCarthy was born in Grand Chute — but it reveres the Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, one of the N.F.L.’s most prominent social justice activists. It is also an epicenter of the coronavirus surge battering Wisconsin. All three counties have new virus case counts that exceed the state’s average for the last week. Of the 15 cities with the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the country, eight are in Wisconsin, and five — Appleton, Fond du Lac, Green Bay, Manitowoc and Oshkosh — are in the greater Fox Valley. And that may change the political equation in an area that is not ordinarily driven by national issues. — Reid J. Epstein Joseph R. Biden Jr. is beginning a three-state swing on Friday with a drive-in rally in Iowa, in a sign of how competitive the state has become with just four days left in the campaign. The rally, at the state fairgrounds in Des Moines, will come before rallies in Minnesota and Wisconsin. While Iowa could be key to a Biden victory this year, the state was not kind to him during the first-in-the-nation caucuses nine months ago. Strapped for cash in the early stages of the Democratic primary, Mr. Biden had a much weaker presence in the state than his rivals Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and faced an unexpected challenge from Pete Buttigieg, who found himself appealing to the same slice of the electorate — older voters — that Mr. Biden hoped to woo. On caucus night, Mr. Biden came in fourth. Perhaps most distressingly, he failed to win any of the blue-collar counties in the southeastern part of the state and along the Mississippi River that had flipped for Mr. Trump in 2016 and that represented one of the Mr. Biden’s best opportunities to make the case that he could appeal to the white working-class voters who were drifting away from the Democratic Party. But Mr. Biden now finds himself in a much stronger position, in part because of the bungled coronavirus response by Mr. Trump and Iowa’s mask-resistant Republican governor, Kim Reynolds. The state has one of the country’s highest coronavirus rates, with outbreaks racing through several meatpacking plants, and the virus has killed more than 1,700 people there. Iowa Democrats think Mr. Biden has a decent chance to win back a state where Barack Obama won by nearly six percentage points in 2012 but Mr. Trump won by more than nine points in 2016. “People here are cautiously optimistic and see this as a real shot to win,” said Zach Wahls, a prominent state senator in eastern Iowa who supported Ms. Warren in the caucuses. “On caucus night I don’t think I would have ever said that I’d be excited to vote for Joe Biden,” he said. “And I was thrilled to vote for Joe Biden.” His shift reflects what he says is a larger pattern in the state, one that he said stood in contrast to 2016, when enduring support for Mr. Sanders — who only narrowly lost to Hillary Clinton in the caucuses — shaded people’s support for her in the general election. “I think people here are really excited about him. In 2016 the Sanders-Clinton beef was just deep and that really has not been the case this time around,” he said. Complicating matters, however may be the coronavirus, which continues to rampage across the state. On Thursday, NPR reported that voters would not be able to cast their ballots at polling places in cities including Waterloo, Fort Dodge and Council Bluffs because of closures due to the virus. — Sydney Ember There are four days until Election Day.

Early voting and campaigning have already been disrupted this week by the extremities of the weather: Powerful Santa Ana winds fueled wildfires in Southern California, and Hurricane Zeta knocked out electricity at some polling stations as it carved a path through the South. But New England and much of the country can expect clear skies on Election Day, with seasonably cool conditions in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, mild weather stretching through the South and over the Rockies and warm weather in store for Southern California. The Pacific Northwest, however, may be in for showers. “Republicans should pray for rain” is an adage in American politics, suggesting that marginalized voters who tend to support Democrats are the most likely to be deterred by weather, and a 2007 analysis of 14 presidential elections published in the Journal of Politics seemed to bear it out. Historically, every inch of rain reduced the turnout by around 1 percent and every inch of snow reduced it by 0.5 percent, the authors found. In both cases, Republicans benefited. More recent analysis, however, suggest that the effect of weather is decreasing, perhaps because more voters are casting their ballots before Election Day. “It could also be that, over time, people just got better at dealing with rain,” said Thomas Fujiwara, an associate professor of economics at Princeton University. “Maybe weather forecasting got a little better. In the 1950s, you could be surprised when it snowed.” — Ellen Barry Texas, a 2020 jump-ball state once considered a layup for Republicans, is shattering turnout records, with the number of early in-person and mail- ballots now exceeding the total number of votes cast statewide in the 2016 election. Early-voting turnout has been enormous across the country, spurred by the coronavirus pandemic and one of the most bitterly contested presidential races in history, accelerating a years-in-the-making shift away from Election Day-only voting. As of Friday morning, more than 83 million votes had been cast, representing more than 60 percent of the total ballots cast four years ago, according to the nonpartisan U.S. Elections Project. In 11 states, voters have already submitted 80 percent of the ballots cast in those states in 2016, and five of them — Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada, along with Texas — are battlegrounds. Texas, the nation’s second most-populous state, was the second to pass its 2016 threshold. (The first was Hawaii.) The Texas secretary of state’s office reported Friday morning — the last day for early voting in the state — that 9,009,850 people had already voted by mail, dropped ballots in boxes or showed up at polling sites. Four years ago, a record-breaking 8,969,226 Texans voted in the election. The Texas increase has been fueled by huge turnout in urban, Democratic areas, like Harris County, home to Houston, but rural counties that have traditionally voted Republican have also seen significant jumps in voting. Polls show a near dead-heat in the state, with a slight edge for President Trump. Though Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, is making a late swing through the state today, with visits to Houston, McAllen and Fort Worth, the Biden campaign has not put significant time or money into the state, arguing that it is a bad investment: Texas has multiple expensive media markets and is not an essential stop on Mr. Biden’s path to 270 electoral votes. Early-voting patterns, especially in big cities like San Antonio and Austin, suggest that the underlying dynamics of the race are less like 2016, when Mr. Trump won by 9 percentage points, than the 2018 midterms, when Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, narrowly beat Representative Beto O’Rourke, a Democrat. “There’s no doubt that it’s a real race,” Mr. Cruz said recently. The surge in turnout comes despite the fact that Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, a Trump ally, has limited the number of drop boxes to one per county, an order that greatly advantages low-population counties where Republicans predominate. The drop-box limit has been offset by big new investments in election infrastructure in Harris County and elsewhere. Harris County officials opened 10 drive-through voting sites across the county, fighting off an effort by the state Republican Party to shut them down. A separate action by the governor, extending the statewide early voting period by six days, has also contributed to the increases. — Glenn Thrush Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former President Barack Obama will make their first public joint appearances of 2020 at rallies in Detroit and Flint, Mich., as the Biden campaign makes a final push for a Blue Wall state that crumbled on Democrats four years ago. Mr. Biden’s campaign announced on Friday that the two men — whose chilly early alliance blossomed into a genuine friendship over eight years in the White House — “will travel to Michigan to discuss bringing Americans together to address the crises facing the country and winning the battle for the soul of the nation.” The campaign, in keeping with its tight-lipped approach to major events, did not release specific times or locations for the appearances. Both will be “drive-in” rallies in which supporters gather in parking lots at pandemic-appropriate social distances, with an afternoon rally in Flint followed by an evening event in Detroit. Their objective in a state President Trump carried by just 10,704 votes in 2016 was far less of a mystery: Hillary Clinton’s loss was the result, in part, of lackluster turnout among Black voters in Detroit and Flint. Mr. Trump has also spent much of his recent time in the state. He is scheduled to hold a rally this afternoon in Oakland County, a moderate suburban bellwether that has been slipping away from Republicans. Mr. Biden has held a steady lead in the state for months, but his campaign has warned against the kind of overconfidence that prompted Mrs. Clinton to scale back campaigning in the Upper Midwest four years ago. — Glenn Thrush President Trump has called off plans to appear at the Trump International Hotel on election night and is likely to be at the White House instead, according to a person familiar with the plans. Advisers had said privately that Mr. Trump was going to appear at his namesake hotel in Washington for an election night party for which his campaign had sent out multiple fund-raising solicitations to his supporters. “November 3rd will go down in history as the night we won FOUR MORE YEARS. It will be absolutely EPIC, and the only thing that could make it better is having YOU there,” read one solicitation from the president that included an image of Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, under the words “Join us on election night.” It was unclear why the plans had changed. But the prospect of the president appearing on the night of the election at the hotel was certain to reinforce concerns about Mr. Trump mingling the office with his business. It would also reinforce questions about whether the hotel would be in violation of Washington coronavirus restrictions limiting gatherings to 50 people. And a party would have to be paid for by the campaign, which is facing a cash crunch in the final weeks of the race. A spokesman for Mr. Trump declined to comment. Eric Trump, the president’s son, confirmed Friday morning that the campaign was considering moving the party from the hotel in an interview on “Fox & Friends.” “No, we’re thinking about moving it, actually, over to the White House for — we’re looking at that right now, and it’s going to be a great night,” he said in the interview. “It’s going to be a really, really beautiful night, and I’m really excited.” The last-minute change comes at a time when the president’s opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., has maintained a substantial lead in national polls and a smaller one in several key states. For the last several days, Mr. Trump, who is deeply superstitious, has tried to recreate as many of the 2016 election conditions around himself as possible. Aside from his blunt efforts to raise questions about business dealings by Mr. Biden’s younger son, Hunter, that parallel how he attacked Hillary Clinton in 2016, Mr. Trump has surrounded himself with the people he was with in the final days of that race, such as David Bossie, who then served as the deputy campaign manager, as well as his adviser Hope Hicks and another campaign hand, Jason Miller. Mr. Trump’s approach to politics has always been to treat it as something of a mystical proposition, governed by otherworldly forces in a world in which things generally work out in his favor. The voting results after a campaign in which Mr. Trump has been judged harshly by voters for his performance during the coronavirus pandemic could tell him a very different story. — Maggie Haberman A federal appeals court ruled on Thursday that Minnesota election officials must set aside any ballots that arrive after 8 p.m. on election night, throwing into uncertainty the seven-day grace period that had been in place for ballots postmarked by Election Day. The fate of the segregated ballots remains up in the air. Another court ruling could come down instructing officials whether or not to accept them. The divided state legislature, where Republicans control the Senate and Democrats control the House, could rush through a law regarding the ballots, though that is unlikely. The ruling, issued just five days before the election, comes as an estimated 578,000 absentee ballots that had been requested in the state have not been returned,  according to the U.S. Elections Project. Many of those ballots could already be in the mail, or voters can still return ballots in person. It also comes as President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. plan to hold rallies in the state today. Mr. Biden has held a steady polling lead in Minnesota for most of the campaign. In its 2-to-1 ruling, the court said that the Minnesota secretary of state had “extended the deadline for receipt of ballots without legislative authorization.” “The consequences of this order are not lost on us,” the court majority wrote. “We acknowledge and understand the concerns over voter confusion, election administration issues, and public confidence in the election.” But, the court said, “we conclude the challenges that will stem from this ruling are preferable to a postelection scenario where mail-in votes, received after the statutory deadline, are either intermingled with ballots received on time or invalidated without prior warning. Better to put those voters on notice now while they still have at least some time to adjust their plans and cast their votes in an unquestionably lawful way.” Judge Jane L. Kelly, in a dissenting opinion, said that the decision “will cause voter confusion and undermine Minnesotans’ confidence in the election process.” She said it also risked disenfranchising voters in Minnesota. Elections officials in the state have been instructing voters who had not mailed their ballots by Tuesday to return them by drop box or to vote in person. But the decision still puts the fate of an unknown number of ballots at risk. The court instructed elections officials to segregate and maintain all ballots that arrive after the 8 p.m. deadline. Democrats in Minnesota denounced the decision. “In the middle of a pandemic, the Republican Party is doing everything to make it hard for you to vote,” Senator Amy Klobuchar, the senior senator from Minnesota and a Democrat, said on Twitter. “Stand up for YOUR rights: Vote in-person or take mail-in ballot directly to ballot box.” About 50 million Americans have already voted by mail. Here’s what processing those ballots looks like in a crucial swing state. — Nick Corasaniti Donald Trump Jr., echoing his father’s inaccurate claim that the country is turning the corner in fighting the pandemic, said on Thursday night that deaths had dropped to “almost nothing,” as the nation reported 1,004 deaths from the coronavirus in one day during a record-breaking surge in cases. “I went through the C.D.C. data, because I kept hearing about new infections, but I was like, ‘Well, why aren’t they talking about this?’ ” Mr. Trump said in an interview with the Fox News host Laura Ingraham, a longtime Trump ally. “Oh, because the number is almost nothing. Because we’ve gotten control of this thing, we understand how it works. They have the therapeutics to be able to deal with this.” As Ms. Ingraham shook her head in agreement, he repeated: “It’s gone to almost nothing.” While some treatments, including the kinds of therapeutics and steroids used on his father, have improved the likelihood of survival for those who are able to obtain them, Mr. Trump’s claims were deeply misleading and perpetuate a dismissive view of the virus widely condemned in the public health community. Mr. Trump called critics of his father’s coronavirus response “truly morons.” The elder Trump echoed his son on Twitter Friday morning, writing that deaths from the virus are “WAY DOWN.” They aren’t. Over the past two weeks, daily fatalities have increased 16 percent nationwide. They just broke 1,000 two days in a row, for the first time in nearly two months. Deaths reached their peak in early April, when more than 2,000 people in the United States were dying of the virus each day, but after falling to about 500 per day in July, deaths climbed back up as states lifted restrictions. In the past two weeks, more than 12,000 people have died of the virus in the United States, sending the official death count, which many health experts say is well below the true toll, past 228,000. At a rally in Tampa, Fla., President Trump said once again that the country was “turning the corner” on the virus and repeated his misleading claim that a vaccine would be widely distributed in a matter of weeks. In fact, nine states set new one-day case records on Thursday, as did the nation, recording more than 90,000 cases for the first time.   — Glenn Thrush The Republican Georgia Senator David Perdue withdrew on Thursday from the final debate in his tight re-election race a day after his Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff, called him a “crook” and accused him of trying to profit from the coronavirus. The rivals had been scheduled to face off on Sunday, the third debate in one of two pivotal Senate races in Georgia that could determine which party controls the chamber. The candidates had committed to the debate in September, according to Mr. Ossoff’s campaign. Mr. Ossoff broke the news that Mr. Perdue had canceled on him on Twitter: “At last night’s debate, millions saw that Perdue had no answers when I called him out on his record of blatant corruption, widespread disease, and economic devastation,” he wrote. “Shame on you, Senator.” A spokesman for Mr. Perdue confirmed that he would not be at the debate and said in a statement that the senator had better uses of his time. “As lovely as another debate listening to Jon Ossoff lie to the people of Georgia sounds, Senator Perdue will not be participating in the WSB-TV debate but will instead join the 45th president, Donald J. Trump, for a huge get-out-the-vote rally in Northwest Georgia,” the spokesman, John Burke, said. Mr. Ossoff’s stinging comments about Mr. Perdue’s conduct came during a bruising debate that underscored the bitter partisan divide in what was once a safely Republican state. Mr. Perdue, a wealthy former corporate executive, bought stock in DuPont de Nemours, which sells personal protective equipment, on Jan. 24, the same day he received a classified briefing on the threat posed by the coronavirus, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. “It’s not just that you’re a crook, Senator,” Mr. Ossoff said, turning to face his socially-distanced opponent as Mr. Perdue’s eyes remained fixed on the camera. “It’s that you’re attacking the health of the people that you represent. You did say Covid-19 was no deadlier than the flu. You did say there would be no significant uptick in cases. All the while you were looking after your own assets and your own portfolio.” Mr. Perdue, 70, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and said any transactions he made were executed by a financial adviser without his knowledge. “The thing I’m most upset about,” Mr. Perdue said of Mr. Ossoff, “is that he’ll say and do anything to my friends in Georgia to mislead them about how radical and socialist” his agenda is. Recent polls have found Mr. Perdue and Mr. Ossoff, 33, in a dead heat. If neither candidate hits 50 percent of the vote, they will compete in a runoff election in January. Georgia’s other Senate race is also close, though the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat and pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, has led in recent polls. He faces Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican who was appointed to her seat; Representative Doug Collins, another Republican; and several other candidates. That race will almost certainly result in a runoff. — Glenn Thrush and Neil Vigdor When President Trump called the pro-Brexit politician Nigel Farage to the stage during his rally in Goodyear, Ariz., on Wednesday, it was a reminder that Britain’s bombshell vote to leave the European Union in June 2016 was seen as a harbinger of Mr. Trump’s victory in the United States that fall. And yet, four years later, Britain has moved on from Brexit, and Mr. Farage is widely viewed there as yesterday’s man, forced to travel abroad to seek a spotlight that has swung away from him at home. Despite Mr. Trump’s staunch support of Brexit and his effusive displays of affection for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Britain seems equally ready to turn the page on the president. “There are millions and millions of Brits who voted for Brexit and think Donald Trump is ghastly and something quite different,” said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European studies at Oxford University. Inside Mr. Johnson’s government, where the prospect of a Trump defeat has been a source of anxiety for months, officials now talk about how they could adjust to a President Joe Biden. In foreign policy, diplomats spin visions of Britain standing alongside the United States in a coalition of democracies against the commercial and geopolitical pressure of autocrats in China and Russia. That is a role Mr. Johnson could never comfortably play with a president who relishes the company of strongmen. And on one of Mr. Johnson’s top priorities, an Anglo-American trade deal, officials say they could “Bidenize” whatever they have negotiated with Mr. Trump to make it palatable to a Democratic administration, though American analysts are skeptical. “It’s a little tone-deaf to say, ‘We have this deal with Trump. What icing do you want on the cake to make it a Biden deal?’” said Thomas Wright, the director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution in Washington. — Mark Landler The acting chairman of the county board that inspects and tabulates mail-in ballots in Jacksonville, Fla., resigned on Thursday amid criticism that he had made political donations to President Trump and displayed his campaign signs at his home. The resignation of Brent D. Shore, a Duval County judge who is a Republican, was confirmed by the county’s supervisor of elections, Mike Hogan. Judge Shore was one of the alternates on the three-person canvassing board and had been filling in as its chairman. The panel has come under intense scrutiny in this year of record numbers of mail-in ballots, and Judge Shore has faced criticism for restricting photography and video recordings of the board’s counting and checking signatures on mail-in ballots. It was not the first time that the panel, or Judge Shore, was in the glare of publicity. The judge was the board’s chairman during the 2000 race between George W. Bush and Al Gore, when many Black voters in the county complained that their ballots had not been counted. Duval County, home to nearly a million people and Florida’s largest city, could play a significant role in deciding who wins the state, and ultimately the presidential election. Mr. Trump won the county by under 6,000 votes in 2016. Judge Shore had made at least six small contributions to Mr. Trump’s campaign this year totaling less than $200, federal campaign finance records show. This year, he has also contributed nine times to WinRed, a fund-raising platform created by the Republican National Committee, for a total of less than $200. His resignation was first reported by The Florida Times-Union, which published photos of Trump campaign signs and stickers in the judge’s yard. Under Florida’s Code of Judicial Conduct, judges are barred from contributing to candidates or political organizations. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
