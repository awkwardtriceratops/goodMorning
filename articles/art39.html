Only a few firms released surveys over the weekend. What we did get was not good news for the president. Another double-digit lead. An ABC/Washington Post poll found President Trump trailing by 12 points on Sunday, a result we would have called an outlier two weeks ago but now fits within the balance of national post-debate polling. After the 12-point margin, the next most important thing about the ABC/Post poll might be when it was conducted: entirely after the president’s release from the hospital, and partly after the vice-presidential debate. We’ll have to wait for confirmation from other polls, but this result suggests that neither event did much to help the president get back in the race. Spotting the state-national split. One emerging pattern has been that the president isn’t doing quite as poorly in state polls as he is in national ones, and that trend continued this weekend. An easy way to see this national/battleground split: Compare the numbers in the far-right column with the other numbers in the tables above; the column shows how the poll findings compare with the 2016 election result. As you can see, in today’s national polls, Joe Biden is running about 10 points ahead of Hillary Clinton’s election result, but the battleground state polls are typically shifting several points less than that, which is why you see lots of 6s and 7s in that column above. That smaller difference qualifies as relatively good news for Mr. Trump. If he’s down by only six points in Michigan, then you can still imagine how a late break his way and another polling error might help him squeak out a win. That’s not so different from what happened four years ago. But if he’s down by 10, as the national polls suggest, he will need something that goes well beyond what happened four years ago. State of the race. President Trump is running out of time to mount a comeback, so every day that the averages stay where they are is a bad day for him. Up next. On Monday at 1 p.m. Eastern, we’ll release the results of Times/Siena polls of Michigan and Wisconsin. Later in the week we’ll have polls of North Carolina, South Carolina and Alaska. By Nate Cohn Better polls in the Sun Belt for Trump. The polling lull continues. Many organizations like to begin polls after a debate — the vice-presidential debate was Wednesday — and they won’t wrap up for a few days. But the data we did get today hinted at the possibility that things are starting to level off for the president. The bleeding is stopping? After a week of beyond awful numbers for President Trump, Friday’s polls suggest that, at the very least, his standing isn’t getting any worse. Joe Biden’s lead in the U.S.C. tracking poll fell to 10.5 percent from 10.9 percent. That’s not much, but the poll has a 14-day field period — meaning that one-day changes will be pretty modest, even if there’s a significant change in the race. The new Ipsos poll shows Mr. Biden up by 12 percentage points among likely voters, unchanged since its survey from Oct. 2-6. And a Landmark Communications poll in Georgia shows Mr. Trump up by two points, one week after it showed Mr. Biden up two in the state. Now, that could easily prove to be statistical noise. But there’s a chance we look back and see this, along with the day’s other polls, as one of the earliest signs that the president had begun to reverse some of his post-debate and post-coronavirus-diagnosis losses. Better polls for Trump in the Sun Belt. The Landmark poll wasn’t the only survey to show the president leading in a Sun Belt battleground. Three other polls, of varying quality, also showed the president ahead in Georgia, Texas and Arizona. There’s not much need to dig deep on these polls individually, though I will note that the University of Georgia poll is pretty similar to Times/Siena polls methodologically. These results are not necessarily much for the president to brag about, but it’s certainly a different story than polls showing Mr. Biden ahead by 12 points or more nationally would seem to imply. What about Redfield & Wilton? You might have noticed surveys from Redfield & Wilton Strategies. This is a British polling outfit, and it joins a few other international firms — like the Montreal-based Leger  — in dipping its toes into the U.S. polling scene this cycle. The Redfield & Wilton polls appear to be conducted online, like most British polls, but there isn’t a ton of methodological detail here. Anyway, I wouldn’t dismiss them out of hand, even if there isn’t much cause for any great confidence either. State of the race. Mr. Biden retains a commanding lead, but for the first time in a while the day’s polls weren’t borderline apocalyptic for Republicans. It’ll be interesting to see whether this is just a blip, or whether it foretells a return to something like the state of play before the president’s coronavirus diagnosis. By Nate Cohn Oct. 9 A running table of all the presidential polls released today, with newest entries first:  The New York Times Biden leads by 10 in our average. The day after a presidential (or vice-presidential) debate is usually a pretty quiet period for polling. Many pollsters like to start a poll after a debate is over, so today is a nice opportunity to take stock of the race. Biden’s double-digit lead. Our national polling average on Thursday shows President Trump trailing by 10 percentage points — his largest deficit of the campaign. It sounds bad for him, but there have actually been several national polls in recent days showing him faring much worse, including today’s Data for Progress poll showing him trailing by 15. Joe Biden’s nine-point lead in the Morning Consult poll counts as one of the president’s best national polls in recent days. It’s not just Biden’s margin. We usually focus on the difference between the two candidates, but it’s worth taking note of vote share from time to time, and right now Mr. Biden’s share of the vote is up to 52 percent in our average. That’s a pretty big deal. If the numbers held, Mr. Trump would still lose the national vote by at least five points even if all of the undecided vote went his way. Some of Mr. Biden’s gains seem as if they might be durable. If his rise could mainly be attributed to a decline in Mr. Trump’s support, rather than an increase in his own, you could assume that most of Mr. Trump’s former supporters would ultimately return to the president’s side during a better news cycle. But that’s not all that has happened here. It’s hard to stress how rare it is for a presidential candidate in the modern era to have such a high share of the vote at this stage. Just go back through the last decade of Real Clear Politics averages, and you’ll find there’s only one instance when a candidate eclipsed Mr. Biden’s 52 percent  over the final few months of a race: Barack Obama on the day of the 2008 election. The state polls were weird. Maybe it’s not too surprising that most of the polls we got today — during a survey dead spot — were fairly odd. Most were from partisan firms, and it’s usually worth taking those with a grain of salt. One of the few nonpartisan results — from Insider Advantage in Florida — was released exclusively to the Fox News commentator Sean Hannity and sponsored by Matt Towery Sr., a former Republican in the Georgia House of Representatives. So that’s not exactly what you’d think of as a nonpartisan poll. Another nonpartisan result, a St. Anselm College poll of New Hampshire, had far too many college graduates represented in its sample, which can tend to bias a poll toward Democrats. All considered, there weren’t many state polls worth thinking too much about. State of the race: Mr. Biden took a commanding lead after the first debate and the president’s coronavirus diagnosis. It will be a few more days until we can get a sense of whether the vice- presidential debate or Mr. Trump’s release from the hospital has helped the president claw back into the race. By Nate Cohn Behind a day of dismal polling for the president. On Tuesday, I noted that when you consider how few days remain in the race, it was probably President Trump’s worst day of polling so far this campaign. Today, there were a few points of relatively good news for him from high-quality pollsters. But here’s the thing: Even the “good news” for Mr. Trump is still quite bad. Well, that’s a lot. When you get so many polls on a day like this, it’s somewhat helpful to consider three things: How bad were the worst polls for the president, how good were the good polls, and where does the average stand? The president’s bad polls were really, really bad. For the second straight day, nearly every national survey showed the president down by 10 points or more. Even Rasmussen, often the most favorable pollster to the president, showed Joe Biden ahead by 12 points nationwide. The president’s worst state polls showed Mr. Biden tied or ahead in states worth well over 400 electoral votes. Quinnipiac surveys showed Mr. Biden ahead by a (not terribly believable) 11 points in Florida, by 13 points in Pennsylvania and by five points in Iowa. There were polls by Democratic-leaning firms showing Mr. Biden way ahead in North Carolina, ahead in Texas, and highly competitive in Missouri (down by only two points in a state Mr. Trump carried by 19 points in 2016). In comparison, the surveys showing Mr. Biden leading narrowly in Iowa and Ohio and tied in Texas looked entirely reasonable. The president’s “best” polls. The president’s very best polls today were basically what average polls for him looked like a few weeks ago, or worse. His best national survey was a nine-point deficit in YouGov/Economist — nothing to brag about. There were a few semi-bright spots for him in the state polling, like a six-point deficit in Nevada in a Times/Siena poll or a five-point deficit in Wisconsin, according to Marquette Law. Maybe you could count the two-point deficit in Arizona from Ipsos, but here again that would have basically just been an average result a month ago. A few weeks ago, we used to note that the race was teetering between being highly competitive and a landslide. On a given day, the president’s best polls would show a tight race in Pennsylvania and Florida, but also with Mr. Biden within striking distance in Georgia and Ohio. If the polls were off by a couple of points, either way, you could have a pretty close contest or a blowout. By that same logic, the race today is teetering between a straightforward loss for the president and the worst defeat of an incumbent president since Herbert Hoover. More about Marquette. It’s worth taking a second to contemplate this Wisconsin number from the Marquette Law poll. It’s the first result from a telephone survey in Wisconsin in several weeks, it’s from one of the best pollsters in the country, and the result is somewhat closer than we would have guessed. In most of our discussions about the various roads to 270 electoral votes, we have mostly supposed that Wisconsin is part of Mr. Biden’s path of least resistance after several high-quality pollsters showed him solidly ahead in early September, just after the Republican convention. Since then, the national polls have shifted two to three points in Mr. Biden’s favor, so we would have guessed he was even further ahead today — maybe even up by eight to nine points. Instead, the Marquette poll found an essentially unchanged race, with Mr. Biden up five points among registered and likely voters. That’s two points better for Mr. Trump among registered voters, compared with early September, and one point better for Mr. Biden among likely voters. Now, it’s been a while since we’ve had many telephone surveys of Wisconsin, so we don’t have a particularly robust average in the state. Most of our assumptions about the race are based on polls that are fairly out of date, mainly conducted during or in the immediate aftermath of the unrest in Kenosha. So it’s possible that the president’s standing is relatively resilient in Wisconsin. If the president is indeed holding up well in Wisconsin, that would help keep one of his best remaining hopes alive: the chance that he can scratch out a victory in the Electoral College while losing the national popular vote by a much wider margin than he did four years ago. There are limits to what the president can realistically hope to pull off here — winning while losing the national vote by more than five points would be a real stretch. But if Mr. Trump really were down only by five points in Wisconsin, even as he trails by 10 nationwide, it would be one important step toward keeping that possibility alive. We’ll have a Times/Siena poll in Wisconsin early next week, so that ought to help clarify things. A daunting deficit. You could go nuts trying to decide whether to believe the really, really bad polls for Mr. Trump or the merely bad polls for him, and that’s where the poll average comes in. By our estimates, he faces an increasingly daunting deficit with under a month until the election. He trails by nearly 10 points nationwide. Can things still change, starting with the vice presidential debate? Yes. There’s still a month left, and just think about all that’s happened in half that time: Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death, The Times’s Trump tax story, Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination, a presidential debate, and now the president’s coronavirus diagnosis, hospitalization and eventual release. For all the talk that “nothing matters,” the news has definitely had a material effect on the polls. It’s quite possible that the news could still turn back in the president’s favor. He’s out of the hospital. The confirmation hearing of Judge Barrett could go well for him. A strong debate performance by Mike Pence and a poor one by Kamala Harris could help change the conversation. Yes, it’s pretty unlikely that a perceived debate victory by Mr. Pence would sway many voters to the president. But it could help the president in the polls. The news, after all, has been quite bad — and bad news can affect poll results, even without really causing deep-seated changes in public opinion. As we discussed yesterday, it can make the supporters of one candidate less likely to take a survey. It can also make them less likely to voice their support for a candidate they’re almost certain to vote for in the end — not because they’re “shy,” but because they really do feel troubled about their candidate in ways that leave them unwilling or unable to commit to support him at a challenging moment. It might lead some undecided voters to throw up their hands and back a candidate whom they won’t feel inclined to back just a few days later. If that’s true — and remember that we’re still talking at the margins — it’s possible that some modicum of good news for Mr. Trump could help bring about a more neutral news environment and help him a bit in the polls. That could be as simple as a solid or even neutral debate performance tonight by Vice President Pence. By Nate Cohn A close race in Ohio, and Biden leads by six points in Nevada. My colleagues Reid J. Epstein and Isabella Grullón Paz have the story. By Nate Cohn Oct. 7 A running table of all the presidential polls released today, with newest entries first: By Nate Cohn A day when even the good news was bad for him. It has been four days since the announcement that President Trump contracted coronavirus, so we’re only now beginning to get a picture of where the race stands after his diagnosis. When you consider the number of days left in the race, it’s probably the worst day of polling the president has had. The extent of the bad news for the president. Most national surveys Tuesday showed Joe Biden ahead by at least 10 percentage points nationwide, including a daunting 16-point advantage in a CNN/SSRS poll. Then there was Mr. Biden’s double-digit lead in Pennsylvania in a long-awaited Monmouth poll. (I wrote about the poll this morning. The short version is: If it’s even remotely in the ballpark, it’s a big blow to President Trump’s chances at re-election.) The president’s good news was still pretty bad. Not every poll was as bad for Mr. Trump as the CNN/SSRS survey was. But go down the list and take the president’s best one: down eight nationwide, tied in Florida, down four in Pennsylvania, down one in Arizona, tied in North Carolina. These results would have seemed pretty typical two weeks ago. Now they count as his best, and they’re not even enough for a lead in any of those states. (In our table of averages, he leads only in Texas among the battleground states.) The polling picture is still blurry. It’s pretty clear that the president’s position has deteriorated significantly over the last 10 days or so. What’s less clear is why. Pollsters like to say that the polls are a “snapshot,” but that’s not quite right. Most surveys are conducted over a few days, not in an instant, and all surveys represent voters at the time the interview was conducted — almost always a few days before the poll is released. A three- or four-day exposure is usually pretty reasonable in public opinion research, but right now events are just moving too fast. We’ve been getting a big news development every day or two. We simply don’t have enough data to say how much of the president’s weakness can be attributed to his debate performance, his coronavirus diagnosis or his hospitalization. Is it real? If you’ll permit a small technical diversion, poll analysts almost always debate whether big polling shifts are real, or just the result of something called “partisan nonresponse bias.” That term is a fancy way of saying that the supporters of one candidate might be more or less likely to respond to a poll. In general, Democrats and Republicans are equally likely to respond to surveys, controlling for their demographic characteristics. But there’s plenty of evidence that response rates can briefly fluctuate in response to a big news event. This can contribute to familiar shifts like a “convention bounce” or even a swing after a debate, like right now. So it’s fair to ask: Is this real? Are Trump supporters simply reluctant to pick up the phone after a tough week for their candidate? It’s hard to rule it out completely, but it’s worth noting that the telltale signs of partisan nonresponse bias just aren’t there right now. One natural thing to check is the party identification of the respondents in a sample. If it shifts a lot along with the horse race, that could be a sign that the poll moved mainly because of partisan nonresponse. But I don’t see much signs of a big shift in party identification today. To take one example: The Democratic Party ID advantage in the CNN/SSRS poll increased to five points from three points in its prior poll, while Mr. Biden’s margin went up to 16 points from eight points. If partisan nonresponse were the cause, you would expect the Democratic advantage to shift more than that. Even more remarkable: The Monmouth poll in Pennsylvania found the Democratic Party identification advantage shrinking to plus-one from plus-five, but found Mr. Biden gaining eight points. That’s just not what you’d expect to see if partisan nonresponse were the factor. Another thing to check is if there’s a shift in the polls that use lists of registered voters. Pollsters using these lists can make sure they’ve reached the right number of registered Democrats and Republicans in a state. The Monmouth poll, which showed Mr. Biden doing so well in Pennsylvania, falls into this category. So does the NBC/WSJ poll, which showed Mr. Biden up by 14 points and said it found no signs that Republicans weren’t picking up the phone. (Our Times/Siena polls are in this category, too.) The big picture: Mr. Biden is in an increasingly strong position, but only time will tell whether it’s durable in this fast-paced news environment. By Nate Cohn A recent weak spot seems to have become a strength for him. If you’ve been reading along here, you know we’ve been waiting for a Monmouth poll in Pennsylvania. Today, we got it: Joe Biden is leading by eight or 11 points, depending on the turnout scenario. We average the two results for our poll averages, including the table above. If the Monmouth result is even remotely in the ballpark, it’s a big blow to President Trump’s path to re-election. The context: Over the last 10 days or so, Mr. Biden has had a great run of polls in Pennsylvania. An ABC/Washington Post survey, two New York Times/Siena polls and one by  CBS/YouGov found Mr. Biden up by seven to nine points. This growing consensus would be big, if true. Mr. Biden has been polling well in Michigan and Wisconsin. If Pennsylvania were also in his column, along with the states won in 2016 by Hillary Clinton, it would give Mr. Biden a clear advantage in states worth more than 270 electoral votes, the number needed to win. There had been reason to be cautious as this string of good news began for Mr. Biden: Until about 10 days ago or so, Pennsylvania was a rare bright spot for the president. In August before the Republican convention, Muhlenberg College showed Mr. Biden up by just four points. Then Monmouth showed him up by just one or three points, depending on its two likely-voter screen options for turnout estimate. With that backdrop, it was hard to say whether Mr. Biden’s recent strong poll results were simply a reflection of more favorable pollsters, or a shift in his favor. The consequence: Now, Mr. Trump’s best recent poll in Pennsylvania — the last Monmouth poll — has become his worst. Together, Mr. Biden has led in six straight high-quality polls of Pennsylvania by at least seven percentage points. This is about as clear a picture as we get in state polling. It gives him a clear advantage in states worth more than 270 electoral votes, and therefore in the race for the presidency. By Nate Cohn Oct 6 By Nate Cohn (Algebra optional.) Monday was a fairly slow day of polling. So slow, in fact, that some of the most interesting news of the day came from a poll that hasn’t even been fully released yet. The handful of results we did receive confirm that the president’s coronavirus diagnosis has done little to win him sympathy or reshape the race. If anything, things have moved a point or two toward Joe Biden since the first debate. Today’s national polls: Decent for Biden. A Morning Consult poll conducted online after the president’s coronavirus announcement showed Mr. Biden up nine points nationally. That’s more or less where Morning Consult polls have been for months, but it is a point or two better for Mr. Biden. Similarly, RMG research showed Mr. Biden with an eight-point lead. The state polls weren’t much better for Trump. A Times/Siena survey found Mr. Biden with an eight-point lead in a state (Arizona) that President Trump carried by nearly four points in 2016. Needless to say, that’s a miserable result for the president. If there’s any consolation for him, it’s that it’s actually a point closer than the nine-point deficit he faced in the last New York Times/Siena poll in Arizona. Meanwhile, Ipsos found Mr. Biden up by six points in Wisconsin and by five points in Pennsylvania. Those results aren’t so terrible for Mr. Trump compared with other polls, but the trend line is favorable for Mr. Biden, who improved over his prior result in both states. In fact, the last Ipsos result in Pennsylvania — Biden+3 — was one of Mr. Trump’s best results of the month. Tomorrow, a big one in Pennsylvania. On Tuesday, we expect a Monmouth poll out of Pennsylvania. It’s a big one. Last time, it found Mr. Biden up by just three points in the state, one of the president’s best results of the month. If Monmouth shows a larger lead for Mr. Biden — as recent Times/Siena, ABC/Washington Post and YouGov polls have — Mr. Trump’s path to the presidency will plainly be in serious jeopardy. We might have gotten a clue of tomorrow’s result in the form of a Monmouth poll on Monday of New Jersey’s Second Congressional District, which flipped from Barack Obama to Mr. Trump in 2016. Mr. Biden led by four or five points in the poll, depending on turnout estimates, and while we are quite sure that New Jersey and Pennsylvania are different places, a strong result for Mr. Biden in New Jersey’s Second may bode well for his standing in neighboring Pennsylvania. Today’s CNN/SSRS national poll hints at a terrible result for Trump tomorrow. CNN released part of its new national survey Monday, and it had a terrible number for the president: a minus-17 approval rating. It didn’t release the result of the question testing Mr. Biden versus Mr. Trump, but if you dig a little deeper, it’s pretty clear Mr. Biden’s up by double digits. How can you tell? Well, CNN released a 16-page document of crosstabs from the poll today, which lets people like me look at how various subgroups — men, women, college graduates, white people and so on — answered individual questions. And if you scroll to Page 10 of that document, as I obviously did, you’ll see Table 008 Question A1, which lists Mr. Trump’s approval rating for different groups of voters. The president’s approval rating was broken down into two groups: Trump voters and Biden voters. With that information — the president’s overall approval rating, and his approval rating among Biden and Trump supporters — we can get a pretty good estimate for the results of the poll Tuesday. It can’t be perfect — for one, we don’t know how many undecided voters were in the survey or whether they approved of the president, and rounding is a minor issue — but we can definitely get in the ballpark. Take the president’s 40 percent approval rating. According to the poll, the president is getting positive job approval from 3 percent of Biden voters and 92 percent of Trump supporters. If, for the moment, we stipulated that there were no undecided or third-party voters, we could make a rough guess of the results of the survey. For those who like math, the algebra is straightforward: 40 = 92x+3(1-x), where x is the president’s share of the vote in the poll. If you solve for x, then the president has 41.6 percent, with 58.4 for Mr. Biden. Run the same math on the president’s disapproval, and you get Biden 57.3, Trump 42.7. Those are 17- and 15-point leads. Now, there are some undecided voters, of course, and we don’t know whether they approve or disapprove of the president. But CNN doesn’t usually have many undecided voters, so we’re almost certainly talking about a double-digit lead for Mr. Biden. And if you take the average of their last two polls, you’d guess it’s quite a bit larger than a 10-point Biden lead. Maybe even 15. We’ll find out the real result soon enough. That’s obviously a bit of an outlier, but … NBC/WSJ had it Biden plus-14 on Sunday. By Nate Cohn Biden leads by eight points. Joe Biden holds a significant lead in Arizona after the first presidential debate, a new survey released Monday showed, as Arizona Republicans face dissent in their ranks and an influx of Democratic-leaning voters in one of the nation’s fastest-growing states. In the New York Times/Siena College survey, Mr. Biden leads President Trump by eight percentage points in Arizona, 49 percent to 41 percent. The poll began on Thursday, hours before President Trump announced he had contracted the coronavirus. Mr. Biden fared significantly better in interviews conducted on Friday and Saturday, after controlling for the demographic characteristics of the respondents. Two nights of interviews in one survey, however, are not enough to make any confident claims about the effect of the president’s diagnosis on public opinion. The result is better for Mr. Biden than his average lead of four points from other recent Arizona surveys, but it is essentially unchanged from the last Times/Siena poll of the state in September, which showed him leading by nine points, 49 percent to 40 percent. Right or wrong, Times/Siena surveys of Arizona have tended to show bigger Biden leads than other surveys of Arizona this cycle. The findings confirm that the Republican grip on Arizona is in jeopardy, after it spent decades as a bastion of Sun Belt conservatism. It was the home of Barry Goldwater and John McCain, but the state’s Republican vote has fractured during the Trump era. The president became embroiled in high-profile battles with the state’s former Republican senators, Jeff Flake and Mr. McCain, who died in 2018. An influx of new voters has deepened the party’s woes, threatening to turn another state blue in the once reliably Republican interior West. In 2016, Mr. Trump won the state by 3.5 percentage points, a significant decline in Republican standing since Mitt Romney’s nine-point win in the 2012 presidential election. In the 2018 midterms, the Democratic Senate candidate, Kyrsten Sinema, defeated Martha McSally by more than two points. In the race for U.S. Senate next month, the Democrat Mark Kelly leads Ms. McSally — appointed to the Senate seat once held by Mr. McCain — by 11 percentage points, 50-39. A shift among Republican voters in the state toward Democrats appears to represent about one-half of the Republican challenge in the state, while the changing electorate makes up the other half. Mr. Biden leads by two percentage points, 46-44, among likely voters with a validated record of voting in the 2016 election — a group that reports voting for Mr. Trump by six points in 2016, 47-41. Meaningful defections. The president has suffered modest but meaningful defections among the voters who supported him four years ago. Today 87 percent of those voters back him, while 6 percent do not. Registered Republicans back Mr. Trump, 82-9. Mr. Biden, in contrast, has the benefit of a more unified Democratic base. Hillary Clinton voters back Mr. Biden, 93-2, while registered Democrats back Mr. Biden, 90-3. Mr. Biden also holds a 55-16 lead among validated 2016 voters who said they didn’t back one of the major-party candidates four years ago, a potentially crucial shift in a state where Mr. Trump won with just 48 percent of the vote. Mr. Biden’s gains among minor-party voters would be enough by themselves to eliminate Mr. Trump’s advantage from 2016. Big lead among those who didn’t vote in 2016. At the same time, Mr. Biden holds a 22-point lead among likely voters in Arizona who did not participate in the 2016 election. These voters make up a surprising 32 percent of the electorate. That’s the second-highest such group in any Times/Siena survey so far this year, trailing only nearby Nevada — the nation’s fastest-growing state. Such a huge number of new voters might seem hard to believe, or indicative of the potential for unprecedented turnout. But it is nearly identical to the 30 percent of currently registered 2016 voters in Arizona who were not validated voters in the state in 2012, according to voter file data from L2, a nonpartisan political data firm. For many of these people, the idea of voting isn’t a hypothetical. Many of them probably cast ballots in other states. Others have already revealed their high levels of political engagement: One-third of the new voters already participated in the 2018 midterm elections, and they represent 10 percent of the 2020 likely electorate. In our poll, they backed Mr. Biden by a margin of 64 percent to 29 percent. By Nate Cohn Oct. 5 A running table of all the presidential polls released today, with newest entries first: By Nate Cohn Little change, but post-debate polls show hints of strength for Biden. The news is changing so quickly that even new polls seem woefully out of date. At this point, we’ve seen enough to say that the first presidential debate seemed to change the race slightly. But now the question is where things stand after the announcement early Friday of President Trump’s positive coronavirus test. Today, we have our first clues. On balance, the polls Sunday didn’t show much of a shift: Ipsos/Reuters has Biden up by 10 percentage points in a survey conducted entirely on Friday and Saturday, after the announcement of the president’s diagnosis. That’s just one point higher than in its last several national polls, including one from after the debate. It did find that nearly two-thirds of Americans think Mr. Trump could have avoided the virus if he had taken it more seriously. (That figure includes nine in 10 Democrats and five in 10 Republicans.) YouGov/Yahoo found Mr. Biden up by eight points in interviews conducted on Friday and Saturday. This one’s a little tougher to untangle: It’s a three-point improvement for Joe Biden compared with the YouGov/Yahoo poll conducted immediately before the debate, but it’s basically in line with the other YouGov polls sponsored by other organizations. In general, the YouGov polls seem to lean in various ways depending on their sponsor, with the president faring better in YouGov/Yahoo polls than in YouGov/CBS News national polls, with YouGov/Economist polls in between. As with the Ipsos poll, there’s little reason to expect the president to benefit much from the sympathy of the public. On question after question, a majority of Americans said the president hadn’t been taking the coronavirus seriously, whether in terms of policy or personal conduct. Put together, it’s too early to know whether Mr. Biden’s lead has changed as a result of the president’s diagnosis, but it’s safe to say that the president’s conduct on coronavirus to this point will probably prevent him from getting too many sympathy points from the electorate. A clearer post-debate, pre-covid picture We did get a clearer sense of the race post-debate. And it’s not particularly encouraging for Mr. Trump. Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania If you’ve been reading this page, you know that a lot hinges on whether Mr. Biden has a modest or a significant lead in Pennsylvania. The state is so important to the electoral calculus that a big lead for Mr. Biden in Pennsylvania is tantamount to a big lead over all, while a tight race in the state all but translates to a close race over all — regardless of what the national polls say. This weekend, the news was bad for the president. He trailed by seven points in Times/Siena and CBS/YouGov surveys, and these are only the latest in a rough run of polls over the last few weeks. Obviously, polling averages are not election results, something we’ll repeat many times in the coming weeks. But this fact is inescapable: A big Biden lead in Pennsylvania is devastating for Mr. Trump’s re-election chances. More tough results for Trump in Florida and Ohio. Times/Siena and CBS/YouGov polls also had poor results for the president in Florida (trailing by five) and Ohio (even), two states that are all but must-win for him. It’s not a huge surprise, given the overall national environment. A national poll from NBC/Wall Street Journal showed Mr. Biden leading by 14 points nationally, one of his best national poll results in several months. On its face, it’s probably an outlier — the kind you’d fully expect from time to time. But the NBC/WSJ poll is usually quite steady, so a Biden plus-14 result is a little more intriguing than it might be otherwise. The president loses what looked like good news. One of the better pieces of news for the president over the last few weeks has been the steadily tightening U.S.C./Dornsife poll. Well, turns out that was just a mistake. The U.S.C. poll corrected what it initially described as a “technical error,” and now the poll doesn’t show the president gaining. The U.S.C. poll ought to be — and in important respects is — a good poll. It’s serious work, and a serious approach. But it has had a tough run, dating to 2016. Some of what went wrong in 2016 was exacerbated by errors distinct to its approach, but most of what’s going on here is mistakes anyone could make. It’s really too bad. State of the race: The polls are behind the news, and they will be for a while, but what we see so far is pretty consistent with what we already knew: Mr. Biden is ahead, and it’s the president who needs to be inching back in the race. By Nate Cohn Biden leads in two states crucial to Trump’s re-election chances. By overwhelming margins, voters in Pennsylvania and Florida were repelled by President Trump’s conduct in the first general election debate, according to New York Times/Siena College surveys, as Joseph R. Biden Jr. maintained a lead in the two largest battleground states. We have the story over at The Upshot. By Nate Cohn Wait-and-see mode continues. The first wave of post-debate polls aren’t complete yet, but they’re already out of date. On Friday, the presidential campaign was upended by President Trump’s announcement that he tested positive for coronavirus. How will voters process the news? The short answer is that we don’t know and won’t for some time. Most likely, we’ll have initial glimpses at some of these questions over the weekend from some online polls like YouGov. More clarity will take more time. Many pollsters, after all, are still conducting their post-debate surveys. We’ll have to wait for the next wave of polls — beyond the post-debate polls — before we’ll get a clear sense of the fallout. That said, nearly 20 polls were released Friday, most of them conducted before the debate. Some details are below, but you can really think of them as from the Before Times. Post-debate polls were steady. An online but serious pollster, IBD/TIPP, showed Joe Biden with just a three-point lead nationally, down from a six-point lead before the debate. On the other hand, HarrisX and Data for Progress showed Mr. Biden holding steady or gaining compared with their prior surveys. State of the race: Hard to answer this one tonight. The polls are already behind the news, and they’re going to stay behind the news for a while now. By Nate Cohn Oct. 2 A running table of all the presidential polls released today, with newest entries first:  By Nate Cohn But a quiet day over all. We’re still waiting for a good sense of the direction of the race after the first debate. Many pollsters are in the field now, asking voters what they thought about the debate and whether it changed their views on the candidates one way or the other. Most of the polls we got Thursday were mainly conducted before the debate or sponsored by Democratic organizations. Not surprisingly, they were largely consistent with what we thought heading into the debate: Joe Biden has a solid lead in the battleground states, but not an unshakable one. The two post-debate polls on Thursday hinted at better news for Mr. Biden. Neither was particularly of high quality: They were conducted over one or two days, either online or using automated phone calls. But they both showed better results for Mr. Biden than they had before the debate. Landmark Communications found Mr. Biden leading President Trump by two points in Georgia, a nine-point improvement from its last poll after the Republican convention. And Change Research found Mr. Biden up 13 points nationwide, up from a nine-point lead before the debate. A couple of polls of uncertain quality isn’t nearly enough to say there was a shift post-debate. But it is intriguing, and Mr. Biden did win in the post-debate instant polls. We’ll have a better idea in a few days, when more polls start to come in. Other than that, nothing much happened. Perhaps take the time you would have spent reading about a busier day of polls and learn about eels instead? You won’t be sorry.
