Live Updates: Trump Will Frame the Election as a Crossroads for America<br></h1><p id="artcont">RIGHT NOW Despite the virus, Trump will speak in front of a large crowd, seated closely together on the South Lawn. ‘At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice,’ Trump will say in his convention address. After Pence attacks ‘Joe Biden’s America,’ Biden says the bigger danger is ‘Donald Trump’s America.’ Harris says the Republican convention has one purpose: ‘to soothe Donald Trump’s ego.’ The Biden campaign made a $2 million ad buy for the final night of the G.O.P. convention. Here’s how to watch as the convention wraps up. Rudy Giuliani, who went from America’s mayor to the president’s personal lawyer, will speak Thursday night. Deceptive robocalls try to frighten Detroit residents about voting by mail. The pandemic has curbed new voter registrations, but a study suggests a reason for hope. Amid an untamed pandemic that has cost more than 180,000 American lives and millions of jobs, a hurricane battering the Gulf Coast and unrest gripping another city after another police shooting of a Black man, President Trump plans to make his most direct case for re-election yet on Thursday night when he addresses the Republican National Convention. “At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,” Mr. Trump plans to say, according to advance excerpts from his speech. “We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years.” Mr. Trump has been a much more regular presence in the hybrid live and virtual convention that the Republicans have put on this week than presidential nominees tended to be in pre-pandemic conventions, addressing the delegates on Monday and appearing on the evening broadcasts. But the acceptance speech will be his most important moment. Mr. Trump will try to project a sense of optimism about America’s future, at a moment when the nation has had more trouble getting the coronavirus outbreak under control than any other wealthy country, and on a day when the Labor Department announced that over a million more Americans had filed new claims for state jobless benefits last week,  in the latest sign that the economy was losing momentum. “This towering American spirit has prevailed over every challenge, and lifted us to the summit of human endeavor,” Mr. Trump plans to say. And he is expected to deliver a blistering denunciation of Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, attacking the former vice president’s positions and record on issues like policing and the economy. “At the Democrat convention, you barely heard a word about their agenda,” Mr. Trump will say, despite the fact that the Republicans decided not to adopt a party platform in this election for the first time since 1856. (The Democrats did adopt a platform, and sketched out an agenda at their convention.) “But that’s not because they don’t have one,” he will say. “It’s because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee.” And capping a week in which the convention sought to win back suburban voters in swing states who drifted from the Republican Party in the 2018 midterms, turned off by the president’s divisive record, Mr. Trump will make an explicit appeal to them: “The Republican Party goes forward united, determined, and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents, and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.” — Michael Cooper and Adam Nagourney President Trump will speak Thursday night in front of a large crowd sitting closely together on the South Lawn of the White House without significant social distancing, according to photos of the event space taken Thursday afternoon. Hundreds of white folding chairs with roughly a foot between them have been set up facing the lectern where Mr. Trump will speak, formally accepting his party’s nomination for another four years in the White House on a day when the death toll from the coronavirus in the United States topped 180,000. Officials at the Republican National Committee, which is producing the convention, declined to respond to questions about whether members of the audience would be required to wear masks or would be tested for Covid-19 before being allowed onto the White House grounds for the final night of speeches. In a statement, the campaign noted that it had worked with Patronus Medical, a safety and health company, to “make certain proper protocols are in place to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals at convention venues.” It added that representatives of the company had been on site to make sure screening “meets the highest standards of public safety.” But at previous convention events this week, attendees have mingled closely without masks, generating criticism from public health officials about the possibility that the virus could be spreading quickly through the crowds. On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence spoke at Fort McHenry in Baltimore in front of a crowd where people were seated close together. Most of the members of the audience did not appear to be wearing masks at the event. On Tuesday, Melania Trump, the first lady, also spoke before a smaller but largely maskless crowd seated close together in the Rose Garden. — Michael D. Shear Joseph R. Biden Jr. responded on Thursday to Vice President Mike Pence’s blunt warning at the Republican National Convention that “you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America” by saying that “the problem we have right now is we are in Donald Trump’s America.” “If you want to talk about safety, the biggest safety issue is people dying from Covid,” Mr. Biden said in an interview on MSNBC, during which he discussed the coronavirus pandemic, the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs and the unrest over policing that has gripped the nation. “More people have died on this president’s watch than at just about any time in American history, on a daily basis,” Mr. Biden said. “And what’s he doing, what’s he doing about it? He continues to flaunt every single basic rule and basic tenet that Democrats and Republicans both have adhered to.” Biden responds to VP Pence's RNC claim that "you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America":

"The problem we have right now is that we're in Donald Trump's America." pic.twitter.com/hD2SSUd7z7 Addressing the unrest in Kenosha, Wis., after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, which Republicans have seized on to try to present themselves as the party of law and order, Mr. Biden condemned violence “in any form” but also said that he supported the right to protest peacefully. And he said that he was troubled by reports that Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old who was arrested in connection with shootings that left two people dead on Tuesday night, may have had “a connection to a militia in Illinois.” “This is not who we are,” Mr. Biden said. “This is not who America is. They want to bring about some order in safety and security for people, we have to start dealing with the real problems underlying all these issues. And the president never speaks to that.” — Michael Cooper TRANSCRIPT Jacob Blake, shot seven times in the back in broad daylight in front of his three young sons. As Vice President Biden put it, the shots fired at Mr. Blake pierced the soul of our nation. It’s sickening to watch. It’s all too familiar, and it must end. And even as we experience this reckoning with racial injustice, we must also confront another crisis, the pandemic that has torn apart so many lives. 180,000 lives lost, more than 50 million claims for unemployment this year alone. That is the reality of America right now. A reality completely absent from this week’s Republican National Convention. Because unlike the Democratic Convention, which was very clear-eyed about the challenges we are facing and how we will tackle them, the Republican Convention is designed for one purpose: to soothe Donald Trump’s ego, to make him feel good. But here’s the thing. He’s the president of the United States. And it’s not supposed to be about him. It’s supposed to be about the health and the safety and the well-being of the American people. And on that measure, Donald Trump has failed. WASHINGTON — Senator Kamala Harris said on Thursday that the Republican National Convention was operating in an alternate reality that ignored the coronavirus pandemic and unrest over the repeated police shooting of Black people. “Unlike the Democratic convention, which was very cleareyed about the challenges we are facing and how we can tackle them, the Republican convention is designed for one purpose: to soothe Donald Trump’s ego, to make him feel good,” said Ms. Harris, the Democratic nominee for vice president. “He is the president of the United States and it’s not supposed to be about him. It’s supposed to be about the health and safety and the well-being of the American people. And on that measure, Donald Trump has failed.” The remarks, delivered to about two dozen journalists in an auditorium at George Washington University, appeared to be an attempt to focus public attention on Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, an issue avoided by most of this week’s speakers at the Republican National Convention. Very few convention speakers have addressed the nearly 180,000 Americans who have died from the virus, with discussion of the pandemic instead focusing on how China, where it originated, failed to contain the virus. Ms. Harris, whom aides said would “prosecute the case” against Mr. Trump, said the president has “failed at the most basic and important job” of the presidency. She accused him of being too cozy with the Chinese government, citing his January statement praising the country for its transparency in dealing with the virus. The senator couched her attack on Mr. Trump in the most personal of terms, suggesting he had choked under pressure. (The president has often ridiculed others for weakness under pressure, which he perceives as a fatal character flaw.) “Right at the moment we needed him to be tough on the Chinese government, he caved,” Ms. Harris said. “Instead of rising to meet the most difficult moment of his presidency, Donald Trump froze. He was scared.” Ms. Harris addressed for the first time before television cameras the Sunday police shooting of Jacob Blake, the Black man shot seven times in the back by police in Kenosha, Wis. “It’s sickening to watch, it’s all too familiar and we must end it,” Ms. Harris said. She also condemned people who have convened upon Kenosha with guns, one of whom, an Illinois teenager, was charged with two counts of homicide after shooting into a crowd of protesters Tuesday, killing two people. “We will not let vigilantes in our streets derail the fight for justice,” she said. — Reid J. Epstein The Biden campaign will spend more than $2 million to air a two-minute ad on national networks and Fox News during coverage of the Republican National Convention tonight. The ad spreads the campaign’s message of resilience and hope for recovery while also getting in a few not-so-subtle digs at President Trump, who is formally accepting his party’s renomination at the convention finale. “When Joe Biden is president, America is just going to have to keep up,” the ad says, after the narrator tweaks those who “take it slow” as a shot of Mr. Trump gingerly ambling down a ramp in West Point plays. “We won’t have to wait to deal with Covid-19: He already has a plan.” Both campaigns have been aggressively seeking to bracket the other’s conventions with paid messaging. Last week, during the Democratic convention, the Trump campaign ran an enormous digital ad operation, monopolizing the top strip of YouTube for a 96-hour stretch and taking over the home pages of The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post for 24 hours at a time. That digital buy, which cost more than $10 million, reached tens of millions of voters. Buying lengthy ad slots has been a campaign tactic for years. Some candidates have even bought full 30-minute slots to run a campaign-produced documentary on broadcast television. But an ad buy of this scale during the final day of a political convention is rare, even in the post-Citizens United, post-public financing world of modern political campaigns. The ad will air on CBS, ABC and NBC nationally, and will also run on Fox News, local Fox affiliates and Fox Sports 1. — Nick Corasaniti After eight intense nights of programming, the 2020 conventions will come to an end on Thursday: President Trump will formally accept the Republican nomination, and the general election season will officially begin. How to watch: The speeches will run from 8:30 to 11 p.m. Eastern time. The Times will stream the convention, accompanied by chat-based live analysis from our reporters and real-time speech highlights. The official livestream will be available on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Twitch and Amazon Prime. ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News will cover the convention from 10 to 11 p.m.; CNN from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.; MSNBC from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.; PBS from 8 to 11 p.m.; and C-SPAN at 8:30 p.m. Who’s speaking: President Trump will formally accept renomination and deliver his convention speech at the end of the night. Other speakers include: Stacia Brightmon, a Marine Corps veteran who participated in an apprenticeship program. Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development. A neurosurgeon known for separating twins conjoined at the head, he ran for the Republican nomination in 2016. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, an outspoken military and foreign policy hawk who is seen as a possible presidential candidate in 2024. Ann Dorn, the widow of David Dorn, a retired police captain who was killed by someone looting a store during protests in St. Louis. Debbie Flood, president of an architectural hardware and castings manufacturer in Wisconsin. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York who, as Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, was deeply involved in the conduct that led to the president’s impeachment. The Rev. Franklin Graham, one of Mr. Trump’s most prominent evangelical supporters and the son of the Rev. Billy Graham. Alice Johnson, whose life sentence for a nonviolent drug conviction was commuted by Mr. Trump after Kim Kardashian West drew attention to it. Patrick Lynch, the president of New York City’s largest police union. Wade Mayfield, the president of Thermal Services in Omaha, Neb. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader. Carl and Marsha Mueller, the parents of Kayla Mueller, a humanitarian worker who was kidnapped and killed by Islamic State militants. Attorney General Sean Reyes of Utah, a co-chairman of Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign in that state. Dan Scavino, a White House aide known for leading Mr. Trump’s social media. Ja’Ron Smith, a deputy assistant to the president and the highest-ranking Black official in the White House. Ivanka Trump, the president’s oldest daughter and a senior White House adviser. Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who was elected to Congress in 2018 as a Democrat but, a year later, switched parties and pledged “undying support” to Mr. Trump. Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. — Maggie Astor Rudolph W. Giuliani — a kind of at-large fixer and henchman for President Trump, first under the guise of “informal security consultant” and then as his “personal lawyer” — will speak Thursday night, Mark Leibovich writes in a memo on the Republican Convention. Mr. Leibovich explored the moment, and the arc of Mr. Giuliani’s long career: On Thursday night, Mr. Giuliani will speak in a prime slot — the culminating evening of the convention. If precedent holds, he will accuse former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. of all manner of corruption and mental decline, blame China for the coronavirus crisis (if he mentions the pandemic at all), spin grim scenarios of burning cities and socialist anarchy if Mr. Biden prevails and heap flamboyant praise upon his unlikely late-career meal ticket, Mr. Trump. Depending on where one sits on the Trump spectrum, the current iteration of Mr. Giuliani represents either a triumphant comeback or the further decline into farce of a once legitimately momentous figure in the life of New York City and the country. If nothing else, Mr. Giuliani is back and fully ensconced in prime time. Not some scaled back and chastened version, either. “He’s got a boss who is not exactly reining him in,” said Andrew Kirtzman, a New York political consultant who two decades ago wrote a biography of Mr. Giuliani, “Emperor of the City,” and is now at work on a second volume that incorporates the former mayor’s work for the president. Indeed, Mr. Trump seems to be encouraging the fullest, loudest Rudy possible. While Mr. Giuliani fits no one’s profile of the kind of market-tested speaker that might appeal to, say, college-educated women, he is perhaps as close as there is to a stylistic alter-ego for Mr. Trump.   TRANSCRIPT [music] [applause] Crowd: “Four more years! Four more years!” “Joe Biden said that we were living through a ‘season of darkness.’ But as President Trump said, where Joe Biden sees American darkness, we see American greatness. Four years ago, I answered the call to join this ticket, because I knew that Donald Trump had the leadership and the vision to make America great again. And for the last four years, I’ve watched this president endure unrelenting attacks but get up every day and fight to keep the promises that he made to the American people. My fellow Americans, we’re passing through a time of testing, when in the midst of this global pandemic, just as our nation had begun to recover, we’ve seen violence and chaos in the streets of our major cities. President Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest, but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest, tearing down statues is not free speech, and those who do so will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. [applause] So let me be clear: The violence must stop — whether in Minneapolis, Portland or Kenosha. Too many heroes have died defending our freedom to see Americans strike each other down. We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color.” [cheering] “President Trump has stood up for our heroes every day. He stood by our law enforcement, our military and the freedoms we hold dear. He’s made good on his promise to put America first. And I hope you will stand with me as we send him back for four more years, with a clear message to the Democrats: You will never cancel our heroes.” “You may know me as a supporter of President Trump. But tonight I’m here to share with you how he supported me — both as a new mom and as an American with a pre-existing condition. When I was 21 years old, I got a call that changed my life. It was my doctor, informing me that I had tested positive for the BRCA2 genetic mutation, a mutation that put my chances of breast cancer at 84 percent. On May 1, 2018, I followed in my mother’s footsteps, choosing to get a preventative mastectomy. As I came out of anesthesia, one of the first calls I received was from Ivanka Trump. As I recovered, my phone rang again. It was President Trump calling to check on me. I was blown away. Here was the leader of the free world caring about my circumstance.” “I was raised in a household of all women. They were self-reliant and resilient. Their lives were not easy, but they never complained. Money was tight, but we had an abundance of what mattered most: family, faith and freedom. I learned that, in America, limited means does not make for limited dreams. The promise of America belongs to us all.” “I wasn’t born a Trump. I’m from the South. I was raised a Carolina girl. I went to public schools and worked my way through a state university. Mrs. B. from my seventh-grade English class was right. What I learned about our president is different than what you might have heard. I learned that he’s a good man, that he loves his family, that he didn’t need this job. We cannot dare to dream our biggest dreams for ourselves or for our children while consumed by worry about the safety of our families. President Trump is the law-and-order president, from our borders to our backyards.” [music, “Hail to the Chief”] [cheering] The America that many speakers described on Wednesday at the Republican National Convention did not sound like a desirable place: fractious, violent, functionally lawless in some pockets. But their case that only President Trump could shield Americans from this fate was complicated by a nettlesome fact: He is in charge, at present — at the controls of government through the purportedly real-time conditions these supporters outlined. And they would all like to keep him there. “America,” Vice President Mike Pence told a Republican convention crowd sternly from Fort McHenry in Baltimore, “needs four more years of President Donald Trump.” The third night of the Republican convention steered into a bit of messaging jujitsu that has become a dominant theme of the week: Mr. Trump’s capacity to cure the ills that have visited America on his watch but have, in this telling, been largely out of his hands to date. And so Mr. Trump, the argument has gone, can be relied upon now to shield Americans abandoned amid the threats they see all around them, in the nation he leads. “People that can afford to flee have fled,” Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota said of cities like Portland, Ore., and New York. “But the people that can’t — good, hard-working Americans — are left to fend for themselves.” Mr. Pence was more explicit in establishing a contrast with the Democratic nominee: “You won’t be safe,” he said, “in Joe Biden’s America.” Even as president, Mr. Trump has often appeared most comfortable in the role of back-seat driver, jeering his own government like a common bystander, insisting that someone really ought to do something about all this. (“When he has an opinion,” Mr. Pence said, “he is liable to share it.”) — Matt Flegenheimer and Katie Glueck The authorities in Michigan said on Thursday they were investigating deceptive robocalls targeting Detroit residents in what appeared to be an effort to deter them from voting by mail. In a tweet Thursday morning, Jocelyn Benson, the Michigan secretary of state, called the robocalls, which she said used racially charged stereotypes, an “unconscionable, indefensible, blatant attempt to lie to citizens about their right to vote.” The calls falsely claim that mail-in ballots expose voters to the release of personal information — including to bill collectors. My office has received a recording of a robocall targeting Detroit voters using racially-charged stereotypes and false information to deter voting by mail. It is an unconscionable, indefensible, blatant attempt to lie to citizens about their right to vote. https://t.co/lgNEh8mtvf Voice mail messages left by the robocalls seemed to suggest they were sponsored by Project 1599, describing the group as a “civil rights organization” started by Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. There is a group called Project 1599 started by those two men, conservative Washington political operatives, but it is not a civil rights organization. Mr. Wohl and Mr. Burkman could not immediately be reached for comment. Mr. Wohl, who has a large online following, has in the past helped orchestrate efforts to smear opponents of President Trump. He has made headlines in the past two years for promoting false sexual assault allegations against Robert S. Mueller III, the former special counsel, and Pete Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Democratic presidential candidate. A spokeswoman for Ms. Benson’s office said it was not yet clear who was behind the calls, a portion of which were inaudible. The spokeswoman, Tracy Wimmer, said that “everything in that call is completely false.” “Your information is no more exposed than if you simply register to vote,” Ms. Wimmer said, adding that both Ms. Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel of Michigan were beginning an investigation of the calls, which she said appeared to violate federal laws prohibiting voter intimidation. It was not clear how many Detroit residents had received the calls. — Stephanie Saul Kellyanne Conway, President Trump’s departing counselor, said on Thursday that Mr. Trump stood to benefit politically from the kind of unrest that erupted this week in Kenosha, Wis., after the police shooting of an unarmed Black man, Jacob Blake. “The more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who’s best on public safety and law and order,” Ms. Conway said on “Fox & Friends.” She had been asked on the program to respond to criticism from the Biden campaign and Pete Buttigieg, the former Democratic presidential candidate, that Mr. Trump was responsible for societal divisions that have been magnified by the protests this summer over police brutality and racial injustice. She told the interviewers she had seen a quote from a Wisconsin restaurant owner to the effect that protesters were actually helping to get Mr. Trump re-elected. Mr. Biden took issue with Ms. Conway’s remarks in an interview on MSNBC Thursday afternoon. “He views this as a political benefit to him,” Mr. Biden said of the president. “You know, he’s rooting for more violence, not less, and is clear about that.” Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to the Biden campaign, condemned Ms. Conway’s comment on a Zoom call with reporters, saying, “Donald Trump has stoked this climate for years because of the sick mentality that she just displayed, thinking it will help him somehow politically.” The political clash came five days into protests over the police shooting in Kenosha, a city of 100,000 people midway between Chicago and Milwaukee. Some of the protests have turned violent, and on Tuesday night two people were shot dead. An Illinois teenager who proclaimed support online for pro-police causes like Blue Lives Matter has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide in connection with the shootings. Ms. Conway, who managed Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and is one of his longest-serving aides, spoke at the Republican National Convention last night. She announced last week that she was stepping down to spend more time with her family. — Neil Vigdor Television ratings declined for Wednesday’s installment of the Republican National Convention, which was seen by roughly 25 percent fewer live viewers than the third night of the Democratic convention last week. About 17.3 million people tuned in to watch the convention on television on its third night, when Vice President Mike Pence gave the keynote speech, according to Nielsen. The decline followed a ratings bump on Tuesday, when 19.4 million watched a Rose Garden address from the first lady, Melania Trump. Fox News, as it has throughout this week, dominated the competition. About 7.1 million people watched Fox News’s convention coverage from 10 to 11:15 p.m., a larger audience than ABC, CBS and NBC combined. No other major network cracked two million viewers during that time period, according to early statistics. Nielsen figures do not include viewers who may have watched the convention on the internet or a streaming platform. Many younger Americans now prefer to watch live events online, but the size of that audience is difficult to credibly measure. — Michael M. Grynbaum Two law professors, including one who served as President George W. Bush’s ethics adviser, have filed a complaint to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel accusing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of violating federal laws by addressing the Republican National Convention while on a diplomatic trip overseas. The complaint, filed on Wednesday, asserts that Mr. Pompeo “abused his office” by taping his nearly four-minute speech from Jerusalem, where he met on Monday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials. The address, which aired on Tuesday night, showed the city’s holy sites over Mr. Pompeo’s shoulder as he praised President Trump’s foreign policy and endorsed his re-election. The complaint said there was no evidence that the Republican Party or the Trump campaign had covered the cost of flying Mr. Pompeo and State Department staff members to Jerusalem on a government jet. “Rather, to the best of our knowledge, the entire cost of the trip was paid for by U.S. taxpayers,” wrote the professors, Claire O. Finkelstein of the University of Pennsylvania and Richard W. Painter of the University of Minnesota, who was Mr. Bush’s chief ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007. The complaint adds: “Transporting a government official to any location to take advantage of a unique setting for a campaign photo or video is itself a misappropriation of government funds and a violation of the Hatch Act,” which bars federal employees from engaging in political activities while on the job. Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas and chairman of a House subcommittee that oversees the State Department, has opened an inquiry into Mr. Pompeo’s appearance. The State Department has said that several lawyers reviewed Mr. Pompeo’s plans to address the political convention and found no legal problem with doing so. Officials also said no department resources were used to film the speech. — Lara Jakes Despite immense interest in November’s elections, new-voter registrations have plummeted this year, thanks to a pandemic that has shut down motor-vehicle licensing offices and get-out-the-vote drives by advocacy groups at places like malls and street festivals. Now, however, a new study suggests registrations are experiencing at least a partial rebound. The study, by the Center for Election Innovation and Research, shows that the total number of new voters registered in June in the District of Columbia and six states — Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Virginia — was slightly above the total logged in June 2016. It marked the end of a steep decline that began in March, when Covid-19 began its rapid spread. That is the good news, said David J. Becker, the director of the center. The bad news is that even with that rebound, those seven jurisdictions have reported nearly 330,000 fewer registrations this year through June than during the same period in 2016. “There’s much more interest in this election than in 2016, and the population has grown,” he said. “So in a normal election we’d expect registration to be significantly higher.” And the trend was spotty even in those seven jurisdictions, which were chosen for the study because new registrations could be separated from address changes and other alterations to the voter rolls. New registrations exceeded the June 2016 level in only four of the seven jurisdictions. — Michael Wines A boycott by N.B.A. players over the shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wis., elicited a dismissive response from members of the Trump administration on Thursday — one that dramatically diverged from the expressions of solidarity from top Democrats. Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and a senior adviser to the president, suggested during an appearance on the CNBC program “Squawk Box” that the players were not making a significant sacrifice by sitting out of playoff games. “I think that the N.B.A. players are very fortunate that they have the financial position where they’re able to take a night off from work without having to have the consequences to themselves financially,” Mr. Kushner said. “So they have that luxury, which is great.” Mr. Kushner’s comments hit a sour note on social media, with some sports figures and activists noting that Mr. Kushner was not self-made like the N.B.A. players to whom he had referred. Former President Barack Obama commended the players for the boycott. “It’s going to take all our institutions to stand up for our values,” Mr. Obama tweeted on Wednesday after the Milwaukee Bucks refused to leave their locker room for a playoff game. Hillary Clinton tweeted on Thursday that the boycotts by N.B.A. and W.N.B.A. players were an example of the peaceful protests that Representative John Lewis, the civil rights icon who died last month, referred to as “good trouble.” The courage and conviction that athletes of the NBA & WNBA have shown over the last 24 hours is America at its best.

They’ve seen something that's not right, not just, not fair, and they’re taking action to stop it. #goodtrouble Mr. Kushner was not the only Trump administration official who faced criticism Thursday for comments on the N.B.A. boycott. On CNN, Marc Short, Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, called the protests “absurd” and “silly” and said that the N.B.A. and its players had looked the other way on human rights abuses in China. “If they want to protest, I don’t think we care,” Mr. Short said.  — Neil Vigdor President Trump will address the convention tonight amid unrest in Kenosha, Wis., and a hurricane in Louisiana.
