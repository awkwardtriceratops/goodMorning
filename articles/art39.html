All eyes on Romney, Grassley and Gardner as a Supreme Court confirmation fight looms over the Senate. Trump says he will wait until the end of the week to announce his Supreme Court pick. Justice Ginsburg will lie in repose at the Supreme Court for two days this week. Trump baselessly suggests Democrats fabricated Justice Ginsburg’s dying wish. A shutdown looms as Democrats and Republicans are at odds over a stopgap spending bill. In Wisconsin, Biden appeals to Obama voters who backed Trump. With her primary behind her, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez redirects $1 million to encourage participation in the census. Another federal court rebukes DeJoy and orders the Postal Service to prioritize mail-in voting. Senators were set to return to Washington on Monday with a Supreme Court confirmation fight looming, as Republican leaders weighed the timing of a vote to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. With President Trump vowing to name a replacement by the weekend, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, was working behind the scenes to lock up the support he would need to proceed before Inauguration Day — and possibly before the Nov. 3 election. Two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, have publicly objected to the idea of a vote before Election Day, meaning Mr. McConnell could only afford to lose one more member of his party, given his slim, 53-to-47 majority. Attention was focused on Senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who were seen as possible holdouts but had said nothing publicly about their intentions. Mr. Romney was the only Republican to break with his party and vote to convict and remove Mr. Trump at his impeachment trial. A vote on a Supreme Court nominee before the election could prove tricky for Mr. Gardner, who is in a tough re-election race in the politically competitive state of Colorado. And Mr. Grassley, a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, had previously held to Republicans’ 2016 position that a Supreme Court vacancy should not be filled in an election year. Democrats, who lack the power to block a Supreme Court confirmation on their own, are instead mounting a pressure campaign to sway the two additional Republicans who would be needed to do so. The are also warning of the consequences if they fail. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said that “nothing is off the table” if Democrats were to take control of the Senate, including abolishing the 60-vote legislative filibuster and potentially adding additional seats to the nation’s highest court. The political battle comes as lawmakers are already at a stalemate over another economic stimulus measure to counter the toll of the pandemic, and are working to reach consensus on a stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown at the end of the month. On Capitol Hill on Monday morning, dozens of protesters, organized by a local chapter of the Sunrise Movement and Shut Down D.C., a local coalition of activists, gathered outside the Washington residence of Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. Mr. Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has reneged on his vow that any Supreme Court vacancy arising in an election year should not be filled until after Inauguration Day. — Emily Cochrane President Trump said on Monday that he would wait until the end of the week to nominate a replacement for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in deference to her funeral services, trimming even further the time available to confirm his selection before the Nov. 3 election as he hopes to do. “I think it’ll be on Friday or Saturday and we want to pay respect, it looks like we will have probably services on Thursday or Friday, as I understand it, and I think in all due respect we should wait until the services are over for Justice Ginsburg,” Mr. Trump said on “Fox & Friends.” Even as he talked about showing respect for Justice Ginsburg, Mr. Trump asserted with absolutely zero evidence that her dying wish that she not be replaced until the next president is chosen, as conveyed by her granddaughter to NPR, was actually made up by Democrats. “I don’t know that she said that, or was that written out by Adam Schiff and Schumer and Pelosi?” he said, referring to three leading Democrats, Representative Adam Schiff of California, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. “I would be more inclined to the second, O.K., you know? That came out of the wind. It sounds so beautiful, but that sounds like a Schumer deal, or maybe a Pelosi or Shifty Schiff.” White House officials had indicated that the announcement of Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court pick could come as early as Tuesday and remain eager to get it done sooner rather than later. The president’s aides have been working on a plan for such a scenario for months, whittling down the list of candidates in advance in order to move quickly. Mr. Trump said he was currently considering five people but did not name them. The front-runner is said to be Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago, followed by Judge Barbara Lagoa of the 11th Circuit in Atlanta, according to people close to the process. Kate Todd, a deputy White House counsel, was also said to be on the list. Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, has also been promoting Judge Allison Jones Rushing of the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, but at age 38, she is viewed by many aides as too young. If Mr. Trump announces his choice on Friday, that would leave just 39 days until the election, which would be the quickest confirmation since Sandra Day O’Connor was appointed in 1981. Since 1975, confirmation on average has taken about 70 days. But Mr. Trump again insisted on a confirmation “before the election” even though Senate Republicans blocked consideration of President Barack Obama’s nomination for a vacant seat in 2016 months before the election. “The bottom line is we won the election, we have an obligation to do what’s right and act as quickly as possible,” Mr. Trump said. The president’s stated goal has set lawmakers on a collision course with one another at a time when Congress already has major issues on its agenda, including spending bills to keep the government open past next week and a stalled coronavirus relief package to help millions of Americans left unemployed by the pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 people. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, on Sunday denounced Mr. Trump’s decision to move ahead with a pick. — Peter Baker Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will lie in repose at the Supreme Court on Wednesday and Thursday, allowing visitors to pay respects during an unusual outdoor viewing aligned for the pandemic era, the Supreme Court announced on Monday. Justice Ginsburg, who died on Friday at 87, will be brought for a final time to the court where she served for 27 years for a private ceremony at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday. The service will be held in the Great Hall of the building and attended by her fellow justices, relatives and close friends. Afterward, Justice Ginsburg’s casket will be brought outdoors, where she will lie in repose under the Portico at the top of the front steps. The public can pay respects from 11 a.m. until 10 p.m. on Wednesday and again from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Thursday. Justice Ginsburg will also lie in state in the National Statuary Hall at the Capitol on Friday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced. A formal ceremony will be held there that morning but will be by invitation only over concerns about the coronavirus. Justice Ginsburg will later be interred in a private ceremony next week at Arlington National Cemetery, where her husband, Martin D. Ginsburg, is also buried. The services at the court are somewhat in keeping with recent tradition: Justices John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist all lay in repose in the Supreme Court. Usually, however, such viewings are held in the court’s Great Hall. But the court has been closed to the public during the pandemic. As in the past, the Lincoln catafalque, or platform, which was used for President Lincoln’s coffin in 1865, will be loaned by Congress to the Supreme Court, and Justice Ginsburg’s coffin will be placed on it. A portrait of her will also be on display inside the Great Hall. — Peter Baker and Michael Gold President Trump questioned Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dying wish that her replacement on the Supreme Court be chosen by the next president, suggesting without evidence on Monday that Democrats had concocted a quote provided by Justice Ginsburg’s grieving family. “I don’t know that she said that, or if that was written out by Adam Schiff, and Schumer and Pelosi,” Mr. Trump said during an interview on “Fox & Friends” early Monday, referring to three top Democrats, Representative Adam Schiff of California, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. “That came out of the wind. It sounds so beautiful, but that sounds like a Schumer deal, or maybe Pelosi or Shifty Schiff,” added Mr. Trump, interrupting one of the show’s co-hosts, who had tried to interject that the quote had been verified by journalists. Days before her death on Friday, Justice Ginsburg, 87, dictated a statement to her granddaughter Clara Spera, saying, “my most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed,” according to NPR’s Nina Totenberg, who was close to the justice and her family. Mr. Trump’s television appearance on Monday, coming after the president said he would nominate a woman to replace Justice Ginsburg, contained a number of scathing attacks on female politicians during a few minutes of airtime. Mr. Trump has a history of targeting powerful women, a practice that has intensified as he has come under fire, often from female critics, for his response to the pandemic. On Monday, he began by calling out the two Republican women, Senators Lisa Murkowksi of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, who have said they will oppose an attempt by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, to force a vote before the election. He also lit into a trio of favorite Democratic targets, using his go-to Native American slur against Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, offering a mocking impersonation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and making fun of the way Senator Kamala Harris of California, the vice-presidential nominee, pronounces her name. — Glenn Thrush Congressional leaders clashed on Monday over a stopgap spending bill to stave off a government shutdown at the end of the month, as Democrats put forth a measure that omitted billions of dollars in additional relief that President Trump has promised for farmers battered by his trade policies. The late-stage dispute, which came as Republicans and Democrats had been nearing a bipartisan deal on the measure, could jeopardize efforts to cement an agreement to avert a lapse in government funding when the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. It came after Democrats balked at additional money for the Commodity Credit Corporation, arguing privately that Mr. Trump was seeking to use it as a political piggy bank to reward a powerful constituency. The looming fight over filling the Supreme Court vacancy left by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death has escalated partisan tensions on Capitol Hill, leaving the chances of a quick resolution unclear. The House is expected to vote on the spending bill as early as this week, but Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, denounced the Democratic-written proposal as “unacceptable.” “House Democrats’ rough draft of a government funding bill shamefully leaves out key relief and support that American farmers need,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement. “This is no time to add insult to injury and defund help for farmers and rural America.” In an effort to win Republican approval, Democrats had agreed to extend funding through Dec. 11, rather than providing enough money to last into early 2021, as they had originally sought to do. They also dropped provisions, opposed by Republicans, that would have provided additional money for election security and extended crucial deadlines for the census to provide redistricting data. The legislation would extend funding for a flood insurance program through next September, extend a program that finances the construction and maintenance of highways, and prevent furloughs at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency that has seen a dip in revenue partly because of the pandemic. But the bill did not include any additional relief for American families or businesses struggling to weather the toll of the pandemic, as talks over a broader coronavirus relief package remained at an impasse. — Emily Cochrane Joseph R. Biden Jr. traveled to Wisconsin on Monday, where he planned to make an appeal to voters who once supported Barack Obama but were drawn to President Trump in the last presidential election. In his latest campaign trip to a critical Midwestern battleground, Mr. Biden spoke in Manitowoc, a city along Lake Michigan in a county that Mr. Trump won by 21 points in 2016 — a significant shift from 2008, when Barack Obama won there. (Mitt Romney narrowly won in 2012.) A Biden campaign official said Mr. Biden, the former vice president, would press the “Scranton vs. Park Avenue” message that he has pushed in recent days, invoking his hometown, Scranton, Pa., to argue that Mr. Trump cares only about the rich, and the stock market. Mr. Biden also planned to address the latest grim milestone in the coronavirus pandemic, with the death toll in the United States now at about 200,000. The trip on Monday was Mr. Biden’s second to Wisconsin this year. In early September, he visited Kenosha after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, and held a small event in Wauwatosa, a Milwaukee suburb. Polls continue to show Mr. Biden with an edge in Wisconsin. A poll conducted by The New York Times and Siena College this month found him with a five-point lead over Mr. Trump among likely voters. — Thomas Kaplan With a little more than a week left before the deadline to complete the census, so-called counters have been knocking on doors across the country in order to boost the number of people included. In New York City, their work has been supplemented by a million-dollar effort from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Since easily winning a Democratic primary this summer, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has repurposed her campaign operation to spread the word about the census, using digital ads, flyers and phone banks to encourage people in her district, half of whom are immigrants, to participate in spite of potential fear of federal immigration authorities. “Whether you do have papers or you don’t have papers, it’s 100 percent confidential,” she said in Spanish in a recent Telemundo online forum, highlighting the Sept. 30 deadline. Nonetheless, the congresswoman said in a subsequent interview with The Times, “I don’t think there’s any way you can fully match or undo the damage the president has done in stoking fear among immigrants around filling out the census.” Beyond the Trump administration’s effort to exclude unauthorized immigrants from this year’s census, which was deemed illegal by a federal court, the pandemic has also hurt the count. The census helps determine the distribution of federal funding, how many seats in the House of Representatives each state is entitled to, and the geographical boundaries of legislative districts. “We have an opportunity not just to count everybody, not just to make sure that resources are allocated justly, but also to really redraw the entire political possibilities of the House,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said Saturday. That day, she posted up at the edge of Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx, distributing bags of groceries, school supplies and written information about the census in English, Spanish and Bangla to passersby. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s monthslong effort to raise awareness has featured digital ads in Spanish on platforms like Vevo, Univision, YouTube and Facebook that have been geographically targeted toward neighborhoods with particularly poor participation in her district, which includes parts of Queens and the Bronx. She also redirected a dozen paid campaign staffers who dispatched volunteers for thousands of shifts to support the effort. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said that grass-roots organizing is about more than elections. “It’s about a broader theory of change,” she said, “so you don’t pin every single hope and every single path for our country’s future just on what happens on one election night.” — Rebecca R. Ruiz Dan Crenshaw, a high-profile freshman Republican congressman from the Houston suburbs, acknowledged on Monday that moderate voters in his district “have a personal dislike” for President Trump — yet another harbinger of possible trouble for the G.O.P. in a supposedly safe Red State. Mr. Crenshaw, one of the few Republican stars to emerge from the Democrat-dominated class of 2018, was asked about his party’s struggles in suburban areas during an online question-and-answer session sponsored by Politico and The Texas Tribune. His response was candid. “It’s not secret that in the suburbs, and especially amongst women,” voters “are simply turned off by Donald Trump,” said Mr. Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL who lost his right eye in an insurgent attack in Afghanistan. “It’s pretty obvious to me as I talk to people on a daily basis, in these suburban areas around Harris County, for instance, that people are definitely center-right voters, but they don’t want to vote for Donald Trump,” he said. “They have a personal dislike for him, it’s just that simple,” he added. “Does this mean they are turned off by Republicans? Does this mean they are not center-right voters any more? No, not necessarily.” The Second Congressional District of Texas, a gerrymandered crescent that encircles the northern and western suburbs of the city, went for Mr. Trump by nine points over Hillary Clinton four years ago — matching his overall statewide margin of victory. Mr. Crenshaw is currently fighting for re-election against Sima Ladjevardian, an Iranian-born lawyer who served as a campaign adviser to Beto O’Rourke in his campaign against Senator Ted Cruz. Ms. Ladjevardian has mounted a strong challenge, but Texas Democrats still think Mr. Crenshaw holds the edge. The overall environment in Texas is much less favorable to Republicans this year, however. Mr. Trump is locked in a neck-and-neck contest with Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to recent polls, and Mr. Crenshaw’s district, like many other suburban areas, has become less conservative over the years, he conceded on Monday. Mr. Crenshaw has alternated between embracing and distancing himself from Mr. Trump. At this year’s Republican convention, Mr. Crenshaw praised the courage of his comrades who fought alongside him in Helmand Province and those who died doing so. But he made no mention of Mr. Trump. — Glenn Thrush A federal judge in New York on Monday ordered the Postal Service to reverse operational changes that have slowed mail delivery in recent months and to prioritize election mail, the latest legal rebuke to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy’s management of the agency. By Sept. 25, the Postal Service must begin treating all election mail, including ballots, as first-class or priority mail; pre-approve all overtime requested between Oct. 26 to Nov. 6, the peak times for election mail; and submit a plan to restore on-time delivery of mail to its highest level this year, Judge Victor Marrero wrote in his ruling Monday. “The right to vote is too vital a value in our democracy to be left in a state of suspense in the minds of voters weeks before a presidential election, raising doubts as to whether their votes will ultimately be counted,” Mr. Marrero wrote. The order came in response to a lawsuit filed by mail-in voters from six states against President Trump and Mr. DeJoy, seeking to block cuts Mr. DeJoy put in place just months before the November election. The 17 plaintiffs from California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, New Jersey, Wisconsin and New York asked the court to declare that Mr. Trump and Mr. DeJoy, the Republican megadonor and presidential ally installed earlier this year to lead the Postal Service, had violated voters’ rights by scaling back operations in an effort to stymie mail-in voting. In June, union officials received a notice that Postal Service management was removing 671 machines used to sort mail quickly because of a “reduction to letter and flat mail volume.” In July, the agency sent employees a memo banning additional daily trips beyond their initial runs in an effort to save some $200 million. Judge Marrero also ordered Mr. DeJoy to reverse bans on running extra mail trips and to provide the court with a weekly update of the Postal Service’s progress in improving mail delivery. Among the plaintiffs were some prominent New York Democrats, including Mondaire Jones, a progressive congressional candidate running to represent the suburban 17th district, and Alessandra Biaggi, a state senator. Judge Marrero’s order came after courts in numerous states issued rulings last week that could expand the use of mail-in voting. In Pennsylvania, the state Supreme Court paved the way for more mail-in ballots to be counted by extending the due date by which they must be received by election officials and allowing the expanded use of drop boxes. In Washington State, a federal judge blocked Mr. DeJoy’s operational and policy changes, issuing a nationwide injunction to force the Postal Service to reverse them. — Luke Broadwater AD WATCH An ad focusing on the Supreme Court vacancy after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is hitting the airwaves in a critical Senate race, as Sara Gideon, the Democratic challenger to Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has made Ms. Collins’s support of President Trump’s past nominees an issue in a new ad. pic.twitter.com/mnNsoy4zHW The ad, which features footage of Ms. Gideon speaking at a town-hall style event earlier this year, seeks to tie Ms. Collins to the national Republican Party — and particularly to Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and Mr. Trump. The ad says the Senate under Mr. McConnell is “virtually just rubber stamping almost every one” of Mr. Trump’s judicial picks. Ms. Collins, who has served in the Senate for more than two decades, has carved out an independent reputation that the ad seeks to undercut by portraying a vote for her as a vote to keep Mr. McConnell as majority leader. Ms. Collins has reliably been at the center of the biggest judicial confirmation fights, most notably over Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, whom she ultimately voted to confirm. That vote helped spur an outpouring of donations — $4 million — to oppose Ms. Collins in 2020. The ad does not mention Justice Ginsburg but it arrives as the new vacancy makes the high court an urgent issue. Ms. Collins has said that “the decision on a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court should be made by the president who is elected on Nov. 3” but she has not specifically said how she would vote. The Republican-controlled Senate under Mr. McConnell has prioritized confirming Mr. Trump’s judicial appointments, putting more than 200 on the bench, even adopting an informal slogan: Leave no vacancy behind. The ad was posted online on Monday and will air on television in Maine starting on Tuesday. This is the first ad to bring up judgeships since Justice Ginsburg’s passing but it likely will not be the last. The Gideon campaign clearly wants the Supreme Court to be front of mind for Maine voters, and for them to view Ms. Collins as a rank-and-file Republican rather than as an independent-minded incumbent. — Shane Goldmacher THE UPSHOT It will be a while until we have a good understanding of public opinion in the aftermath of the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Most high-quality polls are conducted over three or more days, so we’ll have to wait to see many full poll results. Even then, those results will reflect only the state of play at the outset of what’s sure to be a long fight. But here’s what we know so far. The early results are decent for Biden. We do have our first results from a few quick online surveys. YouGov found that voters didn’t want President Trump to appoint a new Supreme Court justice before the 2021 presidential inauguration, by a margin of 51 percent to 42 percent, and that if Mr. Trump did appoint a new justice, they did not want the Senate to seat him or her. Ipsos found that a much larger majority of Americans — 62 percent — think that the winner of the presidential election should replace Justice Ginsburg, while just 23 percent disagreed. Why the big difference? Question wording. The results of issue questions are often highly sensitive to the wording of the question. In this case, the huge difference between the Ipsos and YouGov results might be explained by a common bias in questionnaire design: acquiescence bias. In general, people tend to be nice and agreeable, so questions that simply ask voters to agree or disagree with a statement will generally find higher support for “agreement” than a similar question with a forced choice between opposing ideas. In this case, if the pollster simply asks whether the respondent agrees that the winner of the election should replace Justice Ginsburg, most voters might say “yes.” But if you give the same respondents a second option — whether Mr. Trump should choose the nominee — you can bet that plenty of Trump supporters would take the option, even though they might have agreed, if asked the other question, that the winner should decide. That’s probably a better reflection of the politics of the issue. More of the same in the horse race. There weren’t too many polls this weekend, but most of them were very consistent with what we thought we already knew: a modest but still significant advantage for Joe Biden. Maybe the most noteworthy one was an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, the first live-interview, education-weighted national survey in a while. It found Mr. Biden up by eight points among registered voters, with a net one-point shift in the president’s direction since August. On balance, that’s better for Mr. Biden than both the trend line and the average.  — Nate Cohn Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign said on Sunday that it entered September with $466 million in the bank together with the Democratic Party, giving Mr. Biden a vast financial advantage of about $141 million over President Trump as they head into the intense final stretch of the campaign. That gap marks a complete reversal from this spring, when Mr. Biden emerged as the Democratic nominee and was $187 million behind Mr. Trump, who began raising money for his re-election bid shortly after he was inaugurated in 2017. Mr. Trump dodged a question about the disadvantage during an appearance on “Fox & Friends” early Monday but noted that the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which prompted  more than $100 million in contributions to Democratic campaigns over the weekend, was “a big event” for the opposition. “I could raise so much money if I took one day to make phone calls to rich people, but I don’t like doing that. I never have,” Mr. Trump told the show’s hosts, who repeatedly questioned whether he was taking the gap seriously enough. The president’s once-formidable financial lead has been erased after slower spending by Mr. Biden’s campaign in the spring, his record-setting fund-raising over the summer — especially after he named Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate — and heavy early spending by Mr. Trump’s campaign. Mr. Trump and his joint operations with the Republican National Committee entered September with $325 million, according to Mr. Trump’s communications director, Tim Murtaugh. Some Republicans have questioned how a Trump campaign that has raised $1.3 billion since the beginning of 2019 with the Republican National Committee has already spent nearly $1 billion of those funds before the start of voting. Trump officials have repeatedly pointed to their bigger investment in ground operations that Democrats have forgone during the pandemic, such as door-to-door canvassing, as prudent spending that will provide a benefit as voting begins. “Our early investment in states is going to move the needle in a way that Joe Biden’s campaign just can’t do, even if they tried starting now,” Bill Stepien, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, told reporters earlier this month. An extraordinary influx of cash in August accounts for Mr. Biden’s newfound financial lead, after he and his opponent entered the month nearly neck and neck. The Biden campaign and his joint operations with the Democratic National Committee raised a record $364.5 million last month — more than any previous candidate has raised in a single month — while Mr. Trump brought in $210 million, their campaigns said. “We’re going to have the resources, not just to go wide on our map but also to go deep within those states,” said Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, regarding the Electoral College battlegrounds. — Shane Goldmacher and Glenn Thrush Attorney General William P. Barr escalated the Trump administration’s war on Democratic-led cities on Monday by identifying three that he said could lose federal funding over their responses to protests against police brutality and systemic racism this summer. It is unclear whether the administration has the legal standing to withdraw the funding. An effort by the former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to defund so-called sanctuary cities is still winding its way through the courts with mixed results. Still, the Justice Department said that New York, Seattle and Portland had all “permitted violence and destruction of property to persist and have refused to undertake reasonable measures to counteract criminal activities.” President Trump had ordered the review of the cities’ funding, accusing them of “permitting anarchy.” “We cannot allow federal tax dollars to be wasted when the safety of the citizenry hangs in the balance,” Mr. Barr said in Monday’s statement. “It is my hope that the cities identified by the Department of Justice today will reverse course and become serious about performing the basic function of government and start protecting their own citizens.” Democrats immediately vowed to challenge the Justice Department’s authority. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said on Monday that the administration’s portrayal of city as lawless was a complete misrepresentation, and that residents were going about their business and were excited about the first day of school. “I saw anything but anarchy,” Mr. de Blasio said after visiting the Elmhurst section of Queens. “This is just another one of President Trump’s games. It’s thoroughly political.” Letitia James, New York’s attorney general, said in a Twitter post on Monday that the Trump administration’s actions would not pass legal muster. “This order hypocritically lays the groundwork to defund New York and the very types of law enforcement President Trump pretends to care about,” Ms. James said. “The president should be prepared to defend this illegal order in court.” The Trump administration’s threats to defund Seattle, Portland, and New York are a gross misuse of federal power and blatantly unlawful. Trump, the Department of Justice, and Barr’s obsession with Seattle and me is irrational and most importantly, a huge distraction. Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle characterized the move as an abuse of power and said it was “blatantly unlawful.” The memo gave Mr. Barr 14 days to identify anarchist jurisdictions, citing the cities of New York, Seattle and Portland as some that had permitted “anarchy.” All three cities are led by Democratic mayors. — Katie Benner, Jesse McKinley, Mike Baker and Neil Vigdor TRANSCRIPT The voters of this country should be heard. As I said, voting’s already begun. By the time we get to the middle of October, there will be millions and millions and millions who have already voted. In just a few weeks, all votes in this nation will be heard. They’re the ones who the Constitution envisioned should decide who has the power to make this appointment. And even if President Trump wants to put forward a name now, the Senate should not act until after the American people select their next president, their next Congress, their next Senate. If Donald Trump wins the election, then the Senate should move on his selection and weigh the nominee he chooses fairly. But if I win this election, President Trump’s nominee should be withdrawn. And as the new president, I should be the one to nominate Justice Ginsburg’s successor. We’re in the middle of a pandemic. Like I said, as I speak, we’re probably passing 200,000 deaths lost to this virus. Tens of millions of Americans are unemployed, health care in this country hangs in the balance before the court. And now, in a raw political move this president and the Republican leader have decided to jam a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court through the United States Senate. That’s the last thing we need at this moment. So I appeal to those few Senate Republicans, the handful who really will decide what happens, please follow your conscience. Don’t vote to confirm anyone nominated under the circumstances President Trump and Senator McConnell have created. Don’t go there. Joseph R. Biden Jr. urged Republicans on Sunday not to rush a Supreme Court nominee through the Senate in the final six weeks before the presidential election, suggesting that such a move would amount to an “abuse of power” at an already perilous moment in American political history. In his first extensive remarks on the looming Supreme Court battle since he acknowledged the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday, Mr. Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, appealed directly to the few pivotal Senate Republicans “who really will decide what happens,” urging them to oppose an effort to push through a new nominee before the election. “Please, follow your conscience,” he pleaded in a speech at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. “Don’t vote to confirm anyone nominated under the circumstances President Trump and Senator McConnell have created. Don’t go there. Uphold your constitutional duty. Your conscience. Let the people speak. Cool the flames that have been engulfing our country.” Mr. Trump has promised to nominate a replacement for the position in the next week, seizing on an issue that has the potential to electrify the bases of both political parties and to inject a new measure of uncertainty into an already unpredictable presidential race. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has vowed to hold a floor vote. Many Republican senators have already indicated their support for Mr. Trump’s approach, fueling long-simmering Democratic skepticism over Mr. Biden’s insistence that bipartisan cooperation was still possible, even in an era of political polarization. Mr. Biden promised on Sunday that as president, he would consult with senators from both parties before selecting his own nominee, part of “a process that restores our finest traditions, not the extension of one that’s torn this country apart the last years.” — Katie Glueck and Thomas Kaplan For months, abortion has been relegated to a back burner in the presidential campaign, eclipsed by a worldwide pandemic, an economic crisis and protests over racial justice. But the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the looming confirmation battle to replace her could force the candidates to discuss a volatile issue six weeks before Election Day — one that carries significant political risks for both sides, even as it energizes portions of their bases. Mainstream views on abortion are more moderate than those of the activists on either wing, with most Americans saying that abortions should be legal with some restrictions. An all-out fight over abortion could further alienate the more moderate suburban voters that both sides are competing for. Democrats especially must navigate their own divisions over how far to push an issue that Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, has long found personally uncomfortable. Since Justice Ginsburg’s death on Friday, President Trump and Mr. Biden have so far treaded lightly on the subject. But there is pressure on both candidates to address the abortion issue, because of its significance to their respective bases at a moment when so much is at stake. Socially conservative strategists see the sudden emergence of the abortion issue as an important opportunity for Mr. Trump, who has lagged in the polls. They believe it may help shore up Republican swing voters in Arizona, or motivate base voters who might not have gotten around to requesting an absentee ballot. “This alters the political landscape in a very significant way,” said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. “This will take the focus off the coronavirus; this will take the focus off a lot of things.” Planned Parenthood, the largest reproductive rights organization in the country, is reassessing its strategy to fight a two-front war: pushing for Mr. Biden and Democratic candidates in key states, and pressing Republican senators to hold off on a confirmation vote until a new president is elected. The group is planning to run a new round of political ads. “People are fired up — they’re in front of the court, they’re rallying, they’re holding vigils,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of Planned Parenthood. “All of the tools are coming out to play in this fight, not only to prevent this nomination from happening but also around the election.” — Lisa Lerer and Elizabeth Dias From resistance to face masks and scorn for the science of the coronavirus to predicting the imminent arrival of a vaccine while downplaying the death count, President Trump and a sizable number of his supporters have aligned emphatically behind an alternate reality minimizing a pandemic that has killed almost 200,000 Americans and gutted the economy. This mix of denial and defiance runs contrary to the overwhelming evidence about the spread and toll of the virus, and it is at the center of Mr. Trump’s re-election effort as early voting begins in Minnesota, Virginia and other states. It is an outlook shared among his most loyal supporters and pushed by many of his allies in the political and news media establishment. To some extent, the viewpoint reflects the resentments of Americans living in regions of the country, like upstate New York and the upper reaches of Michigan, that have been relatively untouched by the virus but have had to endure drastic business shutdown measures that have left many residents confined to their homes without jobs or income. “The people who need to shelter in place should do so, but I do not feel that that should ruin the economy,” said Karla Mueller, a Republican and church custodian who lives in Fond du Lac, Wis. “I think it’s ruined a lot of people’s small businesses. I just don’t feel that that’s necessary.” But it is also a direct result of the look-the-other-way message that the Trump administration has sent with increasing urgency, pollsters and strategists say, as the president faces a strong challenge to re-election from Joseph R. Biden Jr., his Democratic opponent. Mr. Trump has called on Twitter for people to “LIBERATE” states that have imposed stay-at-home orders, threatened to withhold aid from Democratic governors and undercut medical professionals who have cautioned against the use of unproven medical treatments and premature school reopenings. He has attacked communities that have resisted reopening schools and business, and suggested the death count was either exaggerated or mainly a problem in blue states. The president’s critics say his confrontational approach has kept the country from forming a consensus about how to fight the worst public health crisis in more than 100 years. — Adam Nagourney and Jeremy W. Peters President Trump’s expected announcement of a Supreme Court nominee will reshape the presidential campaign and draw intense attention to a handful of Republican senators.
