Trump claims the nation is ‘rounding the turn’ on the virus as cases climb; Biden vows to ‘deal honestly with the American people.’ The Supreme Court will allow election officials to accept ballots after Election Day in two key battlegrounds: Pennsylvania and North Carolina. ‘Anonymous’ no longer: Miles Taylor, a former Homeland Security official, says he wrote anti-Trump article and book. Two conservative operatives charged with election fraud for a Midwest robocall scam are ordered to call 85,000 people back. The 2020 race, projected to cost $14 billion, is the most expensive in history. An F-16 fighter jet used flares to intercept a plane flying near a Trump rally in Arizona. In Tucson, Harris tells voters, ‘Everything is at stake.’ Voting in a pandemic tests the boundaries of mask orders. The coronavirus pandemic — which has reshaped the presidential race by transforming the conventions, the debates, the way the candidates campaign and how voters cast their ballots — dominated the race on Wednesday as President Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. held fast to the starkly different positions they have staked out. Rallying supporters in Bullhead City, Ariz., the first of two stops in the state on Wednesday, Mr. Trump claimed that a vaccine for the coronavirus would be available “momentarily,” speeding up an already exaggerated timeline in the final days of the presidential race. (Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said in an interview Wednesday with the JAMA Network that an emergency use authorization for a coronavirus vaccine might not come until January or later.) Mr. Trump insisted again that the country was “rounding the turn” on the virus, even as it is raging in wide swaths of the country, and the nation set a record by reporting more than 500,000 new Covid-19 cases over the past week. He took aim at Mr. Biden, claiming without evidence that if the former vice president were to be elected, “there would be no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving.” And he mocked a California mask mandate, saying, “You have to eat through the mask.” And Mr. Trump, who was hospitalized with the coronavirus, played down the impact the virus had on his own family, claiming that Barron Trump, his youngest son, had had it for “two minutes” before it was gone from his system. Mr. Biden struck a very different note. TRANSCRIPT The American people deserve so much better than this. Just look at what happened last night in Omaha after Trump, after the Trump rally ended, hundreds of people, including older Americans and children, were stranded in sub-zero freezing temperatures for hours. Several folks ended up in the hospital. It’s an image that captured President Trump’s whole approach to this crisis. He takes a lot of big pronouncements, and he makes a lot of big pronouncements, but they don’t hold up. He gets his photo-op and he gets out. He leaves everyone else to suffer the consequence of his failure to make a responsible plan. It seems like he just doesn’t care much about it. And the longer he’s in charge, the more reckless he gets. It’s enough. It’s time to change. Even if I win, it’s going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic. I’m not running on the false promise of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switch. But what I can promise you is this: We will start on Day 1 doing the right things. We’ll let science drive our decisions. We will deal honestly with the American people and we’ll never, ever, ever quit. That’s how we’ll shut down this virus. So we can get back to our lives a lot more quickly than the pace we’re going at now. “I’m not running on the false promise of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switch,” Mr. Biden, who received a briefing from public health experts about the coronavirus pandemic, said in remarks at a theater in Wilmington, Del. “But what I can promise you is this: We will start on Day 1 doing the right things. We’ll let science drive our decisions. We will deal honestly with the American people. And we will never, ever, ever quit.” In the brief speech, he continued to assail Mr. Trump’s handling of the virus as well as the president’s desire for the Affordable Care Act to be struck down by the Supreme Court. In his speech, Mr. Biden declared that Mr. Trump was “on a single-minded crusade to strip Americans of their health care.” The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments a week after Election Day in a case challenging the Affordable Care Act; the Trump administration has asked the court to overturn the law. Since the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Mr. Biden has emphasized how the sprint by Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans to appoint Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the court could have far-reaching consequences for health care, particularly for Americans with pre-existing conditions. In his speech, Mr. Biden quoted from Mr. Trump’s recent interview with “60 Minutes,” in which the president said he hoped the Supreme Court would strike down the Affordable Care Act. “There’s no question that’s why President Trump nominated Justice Barrett to the court,” Mr. Biden said. Then Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill, voted by appointment at a state office building in Wilmington, joining more than 70 million Americans who have already cast their ballots. They emerged wearing “I Voted” stickers. — Annie Karni, Thomas Kaplan and Michael Cooper In a pair of decisions welcomed by Democrats, the Supreme Court on Wednesday at least temporarily let election officials in two key battleground states, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, accept absentee ballots for several days after Election Day. In the Pennsylvania case, the court refused a plea from Pennsylvania Republicans that it decide before Election Day whether the state can continue counting absentee ballots for three days after Nov. 3. In the North Carolina case, the court let stand a lower court ruling that allowed the state’s board of elections to extend the deadline to nine days after Election Day, up from the three days called for by state legislators. The court’s brief orders in the two cases were unsigned and gave no reasons. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the court on Tuesday, did not take part in either case. A court spokeswoman said Justice Barrett said she had not participated “because of the need for a prompt resolution of it and because she has not had time to fully review the parties’ filings.” — Adam Liptak Miles Taylor, the former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, was the anonymous author of The New York Times Op-Ed article in 2018 whose description of President Trump as “impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective” roiled Washington and set off a hunt for his identity, Mr. Taylor confirmed Wednesday. Mr. Taylor was also the anonymous author of “A Warning,” a book he wrote the following year that described the president as an “undisciplined” and “amoral” leader whose abuse of power threatened the foundations of American democracy. He acknowledged that he was the author of both the book and the opinion article in an interview and in a three-page statement he intended to post online. Mr. Taylor resigned from the Department of Homeland Security in June 2019, and went public with his criticism of Mr. Trump this past summer. He released a video just before the start of the Republican National Convention declaring that the president was unfit for office and endorsed Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee. But Mr. Taylor, who had repeatedly denied being Anonymous, did not reveal himself to be the author of the opinion article and book at the time. Confronted with Mr. Taylor’s public criticism in August, the president wrote on Twitter that he was a “DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE named Miles Taylor, who I do not know (never heard of him).” The Op-Ed pages of The Times are managed separately from the news department, which was never told of Anonymous’s identity. Mr. Taylor served for two years as a top aide to Kirstjen Nielsen, Mr. Trump’s third Homeland Security secretary, and wrote in The Times that he was part of a cadre of officials around Mr. Trump who were quietly working to “frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.” As a senior administration official, Mr. Taylor often interacted with the president at the White House, particularly on issues related to immigration, cybersecurity and terrorism. He left government after Ms. Nielsen was fired and later became the head of national security relations for Google. He has been on personal leave from the company for the past several months after endorsing Mr. Biden and has been organizing other Republicans to campaign against Mr. Trump’s re-election. “More than two years ago, I published an anonymous opinion piece in The New York Times about Donald Trump’s perilous presidency, while I was serving under him. He responded with a short but telling tweet: ‘TREASON?’” Mr. Taylor wrote in his statement. As one of Ms. Nielsen’s top advisers, Mr. Taylor was part of the administration during some of the most controversial decisions of Mr. Trump’s first three years in office, including the ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries, the decision to separate immigrant children from their parents at the border and the efforts to turn back asylum seekers. His role in those events prompted protests among employees at Google when the company announced his hiring. At least one petition called for Google to fire Mr. Taylor, calling him “complicit in helping Nielsen tear apart thousands of immigrant families.” — Michael D. Shear Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, clashed on Wednesday with Sara Gideon, her Democratic opponent and the Speaker of the State House, in the final debate of the race. The two women battled over the handling of the pandemic, how to provide health care to thousands of voters and traded accusations over negative ads and dishonest representations of each other’s records. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report has rated the Maine Senate race a tossup, but several polls — including a New York Times/Siena College poll released in September — have found Ms. Collins, who is seeking a fifth term, trailing Ms. Gideon. Ms. Collins is facing the toughest re-election of her career in part because her decisive vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in 2018 infuriated moderate voters who had previously supported her. On Wednesday, she defended both her vote to confirm Justice Kavanaugh and her decision to vote against the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett earlier this week. Ms. Collins highlighted her work in approving nearly $3 trillion in legislation earlier this year and accused Ms. Gideon, as she has in the past, of failing to provide for Maine during the pandemic. (The Maine State House adjourned in March and has not yet returned.) “I’ll hold our record in the State Legislature up to the record of Senator Collins and the G.O.P. Senate any day,” Ms. Gideon shot back, pointing out that Congress has failed to reach an agreement on another relief package. Ms. Gideon, for her part, sought to frame the race as a referendum on the national leadership in Washington, repeatedly tying Ms. Collins to both Mr. Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, characterizations Ms. Collins dismissed. And like other Democratic candidates, Ms. Gideon argued that she would do a better job protecting health care for voters, particularly given that the Supreme Court is set to hear a case that could overturn the Affordable Care Act in the coming days. “I will not stop fighting until we have health care that is affordable and accessible to everyone,” Ms. Gideon said. “This is why I am running for the Senate today, and this is what we have to see through.” — Emily Cochrane Two conservative operatives, Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, who have been charged in Ohio and Michigan with election fraud for sending out tens of thousands of robocalls intended to deter people from voting, have been ordered by a federal judge to call those voters back and inform them that the original call “contained false information.” U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero, in the Southern District of New York, said in his ruling on Wednesday that the initial robocall sent in August to 85,000 people, “cannot be described as anything but deliberate interference with voters’ rights to cast their ballots in any legal manner they choose.” Mr. Wohl, 22, and Mr. Burkman, 54, both of Arlington, Va., were charged last month in Michigan and indicted by a grand jury in Ohio this week, with sending deceptive robocalls to 85,000 people, mostly in minority communities, that stated authorities would use the information on their absentee ballot forms to create a database to track down people with arrest warrants or outstanding debt. According to Judge Marrero’s ruling on Wednesday, the pair must make calls to everyone who received the robocall and deliver this message: “At the direction of a United States district court, this call is intended to inform you that a federal court has found that the message you previously received regarding mail-in voting from Project 1599, a political organization founded by Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl, contained false information that has had the effect of intimidating voters, and thus interfering with the upcoming presidential election, in violation of federal voting-rights laws.” In addition to the mandated calls, the pair face up to seven years in prison for the Michigan charges, which include violations of election law and using a computer to commit voter intimidation. A preliminary examination on the Michigan charges is set for Thursday. In Ohio, Mr. Wohl and Mr. Burkman face charges of telecommunications fraud and bribery, which carry sentences of up to 18 years in prison. — Kathleen Gray The 2020 election has blown past previous records to become the most expensive campaign in American history, with the final tally for the battle for the White House and control of the Senate and the House expected to reach nearly $14 billion, according to projections from the Center for Responsive Politics. The amount spent on federal races is double the previous high, set in 2016, even accounting for inflation. The biggest driver of spending is the presidential race, which is projected to cost $6.6 billion, far more than the $2.4 billion spent during the last election. The figure was inflated, in part, by the presence of two self-funding billionaires in the Democratic primary, Michael R. Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, but also by record-setting fund-raising in recent months by the party’s nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr. The nonpartisan center projected Mr. Biden’s campaign committee, which had raised $938 million as of Oct. 14, would be the first ever to surpass $1 billion in fund-raising. (The fund-raising hauls by both Mr. Biden and President Trump, when combined with party funds, already far exceed that amount.) But it’s not just the presidential race sending costs to new heights. Eight of the 10 most expensive Senate races ever are happening in 2020, including in North Carolina, where the total spent by the Republican Senator Thom Tillis and his Democratic challenger, Cal Cunningham, has already passed $272 million. That is one of just four Senate races to already cross the $200 million mark this year — the others are in Iowa, South Carolina and Arizona — something that had never before happened in a contest without a self-funding candidate. In South Carolina, Jaime Harrison, the Democratic challenger to Senator Lindsey Graham,  shattered fund-raising records in the third quarter, with more than $57 million, and he is the first candidate to ever raise $100 million from others. Democrats continue to dominate in spending, as they have throughout the Trump presidency. Democratic candidates and allied groups have spent $5.5 billion this cycle, compared to $3.8 billion spent by Republicans — the largest advantage ever, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, even without counting the personal spending by Mr. Bloomberg ($1 billion) and Mr. Steyer ($300 million) on their failed bids. Small-dollar donors, who have lifted Democratic Senate candidates and Mr. Biden in particular, are growing in importance, accounting for 22 percent of total funds raised in the 2020 cycle. These donors, who gave less than $200 to a candidate or cause, contributed 15 percent of the funds raised in the 2016 election. But megadonors remain important. Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate, and his wife, Miriam Adelson, continue to be the largest funders of Republican super PACs, donating $183 million to Republican candidates and groups. Mr. Bloomberg, the largest Democratic donor, gave $107 million to Democratic committees. — Shane Goldmacher An F-16 fighter jet fired warning flares at a civilian plane that strayed into the restricted airspace above one of President Trump’s rallies in Arizona on Wednesday while he was speaking, an interruption that drew the adulation of the president and his supporters. Turning and pointing to the sky, Mr. Trump boasted that the U.S. military was putting on a display for him. He then appeared to misidentify the F-16 with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a stealth aircraft that has been criticized for its steep price tag and developmental complications. “That plane's about four days old,” Mr. Trump said. “We have all brand new equipment, F-35s, everything. We’re the envy of the world. Look at that sucker, he’s trying to show off for the president.” The episode occurred about 25 minutes into Mr. Trump’s speech in Bullhead City, Ariz., the first of his two stops in the battleground state on Wednesday. The North American Aerospace Defense Command wrote on Twitter that it had scrambled the fighter jet to intercept a general aviation aircraft that had entered the restricted airspace around 2 p.m. local time. It was not immediately clear whether the civilian plane had accidentally or intentionally breached the restricted airspace. Mr. Trump has often claimed that the military had been depleted when he took office, but the Pentagon operated with larger budgets every year from the 2007 fiscal year to 2012 fiscal year. Under Mr. Trump, the amount appropriated for procurement — buying and upgrading equipment, was lower than the annual averages under President Barack Obama and President George W. Bush. “I love that sound,” Mr. Trump said as the F-16 roared overheard. Mr. Trump’s supporters chanted “U.S.A.” “You don’t know what I went through to get those suckers up there,” Mr. Trump said. “I had to get that money from the Democrats. Oh, look at that. Look, look, look. They gave the president a little display.” It was not the first time that Mr. Trump has misidentified military weapons on the campaign trail. At recent rallies in Florida and Michigan, he has referred to hypersonic missiles, a revolutionary new type of weapon that is capable of traveling 15 times the speed of sound, as “hydrosonic” missiles. Hydrosonic is an electric toothbrush model. — Neil Vigdor At his second rally in Arizona on Wednesday, in the town of Goodyear, Mr. Trump continued his attack on the voting process, saying he was confident that he would win re-election with one caveat. “If they cheat with the ballots,” he said, “that’s the only thing I worry about.” He claimed, with no real evidence that “everyday, there’s cheating with the ballots.” He blamed Democratic governors, singling out the Nevada governor, Stephen F. Sisolak, for state regulations that made it difficult for him to find a venue where he could a rally in the middle of a pandemic. “Even if you want to speak, they make it very hard to find a location,” he said. Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had also attacked mail-in ballots, criticizing ones that would be counted after Election Day, as has long been standard in many states. In the state of Nevada, he said, “They want to have the count weeks after Nov. 3. How many is he going to add during those two weeks?” At the rally in Goodyear, Mr. Trump also sought to discredit Miles Taylor, the former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, who on Wednesday outed himself as the “anonymous” former official who wrote an op-ed in The New York Times and a book criticizing the administration from within and calling the president an “undisciplined” and “amoral” leader. “It turned out to be a low-level staffer,” he said. “A sleazebag who’s never worked in the White House.” Mr. Trump noted that Mr. Taylor now works at CNN, which announced Wednesday that he was a network contributor. “He wrote a phony book,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “I thought it might have been Hope Hicks, I thought it might have been Jared,” in reference to his senior adviser and his son-in-law. The crowd responded by chanting, “drain the swamp.” “The whole thing was just one more hoax from the Washington swamp,” he said. Arizona is a key state that Mr. Trump needs to win in order to follow his clearest path to victory. But recent polls have shown Mr. Biden with a narrow edge there. The state is also critical to the political future of Senator Martha McSally, who is trailing in the polls to her Democratic challenger, Mark Kelly. But Mr. Trump barely ceded his stage to her. “You’ve got one minute,” he told her as she approached the crowd to give her closing pitch. “They don’t want to hear this.” Another guest speaker, Nigel Farage, the British populist politician considered the architect of the Brexit movement, also appeared onstage at Mr. Trump’s rally. “You’ll be voting for decency,” Mr. Farage told the crowd. “You’ll be voting for the only leader in the Western world to stand up to a Chinese Communist Party.” — Annie Karni TRANSCRIPT Now you know there has been some talk about my values. Well, let me just tell you, Tucson, I am a proud patriotic American. I love my country. [cars honking] And our values reflect the values of America. Our values tell us we have witnessed the worst, the biggest disaster of any presidential administration in the history of this country. Our values tell us that, our values tell us that we should not be in a moment where over 225,000 people have died in our country, over 8 and 1/2 million people have contracted a virus when we have known — when we got the information we have known how serious this is. And here’s the thing about where Donald Trump has been on the Affordable Care Act. I just have to say, Raul, you know, you know, we’ve been witnessing the same thing. From the time Donald Trump was running for office, through the time he’s been in office, he’s had this weird obsession with trying to get rid of whatever Barack Obama and Joe Biden created. Have you all noticed that? Well, we don’t need presidents with weird obsessions. I think it’s time for that to end. Do you agree? Senator Kamala Harris on Wednesday gave a final campaign push in Arizona, a state Democrats are optimistic about winning for the first time in decades. At a drive-in in rally in Tucson, Ms. Harris told the crowd that “everything is at stake,” and focused much of her speech on criticizing the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic. Ms. Harris also pushed back against repeated, unfounded charges from Republicans that she is pressing a “socialist” agenda, though she has long portrayed herself as a moderate. “You know, there has been some talk about my values,” she told the crowd. “Well, let me just tell you — I am a proud, patriotic American. I love my country and our values reflect the values of America.” President Trump was also campaigning in the state Wednesday, holding a rally in Bullhead City, which drew a large crowd of mostly maskless supporters, and will hold another in Goodyear. Ms. Harris noted the contrasts between their two campaigns. “Joe and I have been clear from the beginning,” she told reporters in brief remarks. “We are going to talk with voters, but do it in a way that we don’t risk their safety and their health.” During an event with Latina business owners before the rally, Ms. Harris’s aides carefully made sure that none of the participants stood too close together during the photo opportunity with the senator, cheerfully shouting “distance” as the group posed. Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who was shot in the head by a constituent in 2011, also appeared at the rally, to introduce her husband, Mark Kelly, a Democrat running for the U.S. Senate. Polls show Mr. Kelly with a comfortable lead over his Republican opponent, Senator Martha McSally. — Jennifer Medina OMAHA —  After hundreds of people who attended a Trump rally in Omaha Tuesday night were left stranded on an airport tarmac for hours in near-freezing temperatures, at least six people were taken to a hospital and about two dozen others sought medical attention, according to local authorities, rally attendees and reports from journalists at the scene. President Trump had traveled to Eppley Airfield to fight for the area’s single electoral vote, which could determine the outcome of a close national election, and buses shuttled thousands of rally attendees from a parking lot to the event site over a 10-hour period on Tuesday, airport and city police officials said. After the rally ended around 9 p.m., people “flooded” the available buses waiting to take them back to their cars, said Officer Michael Pecha of the Omaha police. “Due to the size of the crowd and security requirements, return transportation took time,” Tim Conahan, the Chief of Police at the Omaha Airport Authority, said in an email on Wednesday. Officer Pecha said additional buses were called in from the area’s transit agency and that last person at the site boarded around 11:50 p.m. Roughly 30 people requested medical attention during and after the rally, Officer Pecha said. He said that about a half-dozen people were transported to hospitals “with a variety of medical conditions.” Mr. Conahan said the number was six. Thousands of people left out in the cold and stranded in #Omaha, #Nebraska after a #Trump rally. I’m told the shuttles aren’t operating & there aren’t enough busses. Police didn’t seem to know what to do. Some walked. I saw at least one woman getting medical attention. pic.twitter.com/oIkmixaZt0 Joseph R. Biden Jr. seized on the mishap Wednesday as he gave a speech in Wilmington, Del., criticizing the president’s handling of the coronavirus. “Just look at what happened last night in Omaha after Trump — after the Trump rally ended,” Mr. Biden said. “Hundreds of people, including older Americans and children, were stranded in subzero freezing temperatures for hours. Several folks ended up in the hospital. It’s an image that captures President Trump’s whole approach to this crisis.” Dillon Bloedorn, a farmer who had driven 80 miles to attend the rally, said he was among the first round of people to leave the event and found that “a wall of people was pushing up there” and that he did not get onto a bus until around 11:30. The first set of buses loaded quickly and took off, he said, but more buses failed to turn up. “Maybe it wasn’t real organized,” he said. Those stranded included older people and children. When more buses arrived, the people who remained made sure they were the first to load, Mr. Bloedorn said. In a statement, Samantha Zager, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign said that because of the size of the crowd, the campaign had deployed 40 shuttle buses to the event — roughly twice the usual number. “But local road closures and resulting congestion caused delays,” Ms. Zager said. “We always strive to provide the best guest experience at our events and we care about their safety.” Earlier Tuesday, the police posted a warning on Facebook, noting that the allocated parking for the Trump rally was full and that the event would not be accessible “by foot, Uber, cab or any other means of transportation.” The drive from the parking lot to the tarmac where the event was held was 3.7 miles. Officer Pecha and Chief Conahan said many people decided to walk back to the parking areas instead of waiting for a bus, and that the foot traffic slowed bus traffic. Some officers gave rides to older attendees, Officer Pecha said. “Many people,” he said, “underestimated the distance from the event back to the parking lot on foot.” — Dionne Searcey, Matt Stevens, Daniel Victor and Thomas Kaplan Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s late-in-the-race trip yesterday to Georgia, a state that has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1992, struck some members of both parties as curious. But a Monmouth University poll released Wednesday highlighted the dynamic that emboldened the campaign to make the gambit, finding that Mr. Biden had gained ground on President Trump and held a small, statistically insignificant edge over the president among likely voters. Among all registered voters in Georgia, the poll found, Mr. Biden is supported by 50 percent and Mr. Trump by 45 percent. And among the voters that the pollsters categorized as likely to vote in a high-turnout election, Mr. Biden has an edge over Mr. Trump by 50 percent to 46 percent, though that lead falls within the poll’s margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. More than three million people have already voted in Georgia. The Monmouth University poll found that Mr. Biden was leading Mr. Trump among those who said that they had already voted by 55 percent to 43 percent, but that Mr. Trump had an edge of 48 percent to 44 percent among those who have not yet voted. The poll of 504 registered voters was conducted from Oct. 23 to 27. Senator David Perdue, a Republican, has lost his lead over his Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff, the poll found, with Mr. Ossoff backed by 49 percent of registered voters and Mr. Perdue by 46 percent. (Mr. Perdue had led by 6 points in Monmouth polls in September and July). And this year Georgia has another Senate race, a special election to fill the seat once held by Johnny Isakson. The Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, has pulled into a clear lead with the support of 41 percent of registered voters, the poll found, while Senator Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed to the seat earlier this year, has the support of 21 percent and Representative Doug Collins has the support of 18 percent. There will be a runoff if no candidate gets over 50 percent of the vote. — Michael Cooper With less than a week to go before Election Day, Joseph R. Biden Jr. is maintaining his steady lead over President Trump in Michigan and Wisconsin, according to new polls of the key battleground states released on Wednesday. In Michigan, Mr. Biden is ahead of Mr. Trump by eight percentage points, according to a survey from The New York Times and Siena College, which shows 49 percent of likely voters backing Mr. Biden and 41 percent supporting Mr. Trump. The result is basically unchanged from a Times/Siena survey of Michigan two weeks ago. Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by eight points in Michigan, a battleground state that Mr. Trump flipped in 2016. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of 856 likely voters in Michigan from Oct. 23 to Oct. 26. The findings are similar to that of a Washington Post-ABC News poll of Michigan that was also released Wednesday, which shows Mr. Biden with the support of 51 percent likely voters and Mr. Trump with 44 percent support — a difference of seven percentage points. In Wisconsin, a new Marquette Law School poll found Mr. Biden ahead of Mr. Trump by five percentage points, the same margin he was ahead by in the school’s last survey of the state about one month ago. The results have been stable and consistent in Marquette polls for months, the poll’s director said Wednesday. Nonetheless, polling averages have Mr. Biden with a slightly wider advantage in the state — about 8.5 percentage points. And a Post/ABC poll released Wednesday had Mr. Biden with an enormous lead in Wisconsin of 17 points. By contrast, a survey of the state released last month by The Post/ABC found Mr. Biden with only a six-point lead. All four of the polls were conducted toward the end of October and had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. Mr. Trump won both Michigan and Wisconsin by extremely narrow margins in 2016, victories that helped propel him to the White House. He won Michigan by fewer than 11,000 votes, his thinnest margin of victory any state, and Wisconsin by roughly 22,000 votes, less than a percentage point. — Jeremy W. Peters, Isabella Grullón Paz and Matt Stevens Voters and poll workers in Texas will be required to wear masks at election precincts after a federal judge blocked the governor, a Republican, from exempting them. The case is one of several related to voting that are testing the boundaries of public health orders as the number of infections surge in a majority of states, part of the latest wave of the coronavirus in the United States. Judge Jason Pulliam of the U.S. District Court in San Antonio ruled on Tuesday that the polling place exemption, carved out of a July 2 statewide emergency order by Gov. Greg Abbott requiring masks in public, “creates a discriminatory burden on Black and Latino voters.” The judge granted a preliminary injunction to the N.A.A.C.P. and Mi Familia Vota, a national Latino organization, which had asserted in a lawsuit that Black and Hispanic voters face a much higher risk of contracting the virus and developing complications from it than white residents. “As a result, Plaintiffs argue Black and Latino voters in Texas are forced to make an unacceptable choice with respect to the 2020 election: exercising their right to vote — or — protecting their own health and lives and that of their loved ones and community by staying home,” Judge Pulliam wrote. The state immediately filed a notice of appeal, which would be heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans. Mr. Abbott has said that he did not want to deny anyone the right to vote if they did not have a mask. The clash over masks and voting is playing out elsewhere. In Maryland, a Harford County man was arrested on charges of violating a state emergency order and trespassing after he refused to put on a mask at an early-voting precinct on Monday, the county’s sheriff said in a Facebook post on Tuesday. In Wisconsin, a poll worker in La Crosse sued the state’s governor, a Democrat,  and the city clerk last month after he said that he had been stopped from working during the state’s partisan primary in August because he would not wear a mask. The man said he had a medical condition that exempted him from the state’s mask order. In a July 31 memo, the Wisconsin Elections Commission wrote that cities and towns could not require voters to wear face coverings, even though masks  were recommended. In Kansas, the secretary of state, Scott Schwab, a Republican, reminded local elections officials earlier this month that they could not turn voters away from the polls for not wearing masks. “Exercising one’s fundamental right to vote is not, and should not be, contingent upon whether or not they choose to wear a mask,” Mr. Schwab said. — Neil Vigdor       Former President Barack Obama will join Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the crucial battleground of Michigan on Saturday for their first joint appearance on the campaign trail in 2020. In its announcement on Wednesday, the Biden campaign did not say where in Michigan the two men would be appearing, which is consistent with its pattern of leaving the precise location and times of events unannounced until the last minute. But Mr. Obama sees his role as motivating Black voters and young people, two key groups that tend to have relatively low turnout rates, and several previous Biden events have been clustered in the Detroit area. Mr. Obama will join Mr. Biden “to discuss bringing Americans together to address the crises facing the country and win the battle for the soul of the nation,” the campaign said in an email to reporters. They have appeared together once before, in a pretaped, socially distanced conversation that was released in July. The 44th president of the United States made his debut on the campaign trail for Mr. Biden last week in Philadelphia, and he also campaigned for Mr. Biden in Miami on Saturday and in Orlando, Fla., on Tuesday — offering a scathing takedown of President Trump at drive-in events. Mr. Obama won Michigan twice, with Mr. Biden as his running mate, before Mr. Trump narrowly claimed the state in 2016. Polls show Mr. Biden with an edge over Mr. Trump in Michigan this time around. A New York Times/Siena College poll released on Wednesday showed the former vice president with an eight-point advantage over the president among likely voters, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. — Thomas Kaplan and Glenn Thrush When Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida went to cast his early ballot in Tallahassee, the state capital, on Monday, a poll worker informed him of something unusual: His primary residence had been changed to an address in West Palm Beach, 400 miles away. Mr. DeSantis, a Republican who lives full-time in the Governor’s Mansion, had not authorized any such change. He asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate. By Wednesday, the authorities had made an arrest: Anthony Steven Guevara, a 20-year-old from Naples, Fla., was charged with unauthorized computer access and altering a voter registration without consent. Investigators said they traced the logs for the DeSantis address change to a web browser that led them to Mr. Guevara. Mr. Guevara also accessed the voter registrations of Senator Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, and of the basketball players LeBron James and Michael Jordan, “but made no changes,” the Department of Law Enforcement said in a statement. The authorities reviewed Mr. Guevara’s computer and found he had conducted Google searches for “florida my vote” and “Florida Governor,” according to the report. “Digital evidence was also located showing Anthony Steven Guevara visited the Wikipedia page for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis,” the report said. — Patricia Mazzei One of the key architects of President Trump’s hard-line immigration agenda, Stephen Miller, attacked Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday “as a radical outlier in the whole of human civilization” for his immigration policies. Mr. Miller has been a driving force behind the Trump administration’s severely restrictive immigration policies, including one that led thousands of children to be separated from their parents at the southern border. (The parents of 545 migrant children still have not been found, according to court documents filed earlier this month in a case challenging the practice.) In sometimes angry tones, Mr. Miller — who as top White House adviser on immigration is a federal employee but said he was speaking “in my personal capacity” — offered an apocalyptic vision of a Biden presidency in which he said terrorists would pour into the U.S. and America’s southern border would be overrun by migrants. “Tens of millions will come from every single part of planet Earth,” Mr. Miller said. Noting that the Trump administration is maintaining a stringent cap on refugee admissions, he alleged that Mr. Biden would approve “a staggering increase on refugees from the most dangerous places in the world.” The Trump administration had sharply reduced the level of refugees admitted to 15,000 per year, but Mr. Biden has said he would raise the level to 125,000, slightly above where it was by the end of the Obama administration. Mr. Miller also claimed, without evidence, that Mr. Biden’s intention to reverse a sweeping Trump administration travel ban would allow potential terrorists to enter the U.S. Four years ago Mr. Trump ran for the presidency vowing to crack down on immigration, promising to build a wall along the southern border and claiming that Mexico would pay for it. (It did not.) Asked about evidence that immigration has played a relatively smaller role in Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign than it did in 2016 and 2018, Mr. Miller did not object, saying that Mr. Trump is “now campaigning on four years of success.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
