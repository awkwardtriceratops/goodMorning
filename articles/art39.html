Obama, in his first live campaign appearance for Biden, will rally voters in Philadelphia. Biden has an edge over Trump in Iowa, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll. A man in Maryland was arrested and charged with threatening to kidnap and kill Biden and Harris. With Trump on defense in key states, some nervous Democrats quietly contemplate a Biden landslide. Voters in Florida and Alaska received threatening ‘vote for Trump’ emails. A.O.C. and Ilhan Omar played Among Us on Twitch to get out the vote. Hundreds of thousands watched. Sam Elliott lends his iconic baritone to a patriotic pitch for Biden during the World Series. With less than two weeks to go in the presidential race, the heaviest hitter on the Democratic bench, former President Barack Obama, returns to the campaign trail on Wednesday to make the case for his former vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Obama will make the first of a series of homestretch appearances at a “drive-in rally” in the parking lot of the stadium where the Philadelphia Phillies play. Pennsylvania, with its deep-blue cities, deep-red rural areas, purple suburbs and cache of 20 electoral votes, is a deeply divided state and one of several Mr. Biden must win if he is to wrest the White House from President Trump. Both candidates have criss-crossed the state in recent weeks — Mr. Trump spoke in Erie Tuesday night — and while Mr. Biden has maintained a steady lead in the polls there, surveys released in recent days show the race tightening. In a video posted to Twitter on Tuesday evening, Mr. Obama offered a preview of the rally, telling young people that they can create “a new normal” in American politics by going to vote. “One of the most inspiring things about this year has been to see so many young Americans fired up, organizing, marching and fighting for change,” Mr. Obama said. “Your generation can be the one that creates a new normal in America. One that’s fairer, where the system treats everybody equally and gives everybody opportunity. We can come out of this moment stronger than before.” Mr. Obama has been a presence of sorts throughout the race: Mr. Biden seldom makes a campaign stop without reminding voters of the things that he and Mr. Obama accomplished together. For the next two weeks, he will make the case for Mr. Biden in the flesh. His aides have not revealed his itinerary for the rest of the campaign, but last week a person familiar with the planning said that Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida were also on his short list. For most of Mr. Trump’s term, Mr. Obama refrained from criticizing his successor, even as Mr. Trump worked to systematically demolish many of Mr. Obama’s achievements. But he briefly came out of retirement during the midterm campaign in 2018 and returned to the public stage again this summer, issuing a scathing indictment of the Trump presidency at the Democratic National Convention. Mr. Obama decried “the meanness and the lies and crazy conspiracy theories” and argued that democracy itself was on the ballot. “Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t,” he said. This evening’s rally at Citizens Bank Park begins at 5:45 p.m. Eastern time. — Andy Newman and Daniel Victor Joseph R. Biden Jr. has a narrow edge over President Trump in Iowa, a state Mr. Trump carried by more than nine percentage points in 2016, and the high-stakes Senate race there appears even closer, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll released Wednesday. Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump 46 percent to 43 percent among likely voters in Iowa, which is within the poll’s margin of error, with 7 percent saying they were undecided or refusing to name a preference, according to the survey. Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican whose re-election race could help determine control of the Senate, is capturing 45 percent support while Theresa Greenfield, her Democratic opponent, has 44 percent. Joe Biden holds a slim lead over Donald Trump in Iowa, a state Mr. Trump flipped in 2016. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of 753 likely voters in Iowa from Oct. 18 to Oct. 20. Mr. Biden is being propelled by women, younger voters and white voters with college degrees, the same demographics lifting him across the country. But he is also running stronger in Iowa among seniors and working-class white voters than he is in other similarly Republican-leaning states. Mr. Biden is leading among voters 65 and older, 49 percent to 42 percent, and he is trailing Mr. Trump among white voters without college degrees by only seven points, 48 percent to 41 percent. The poll, which interviewed 753 likely voters in Iowa by phone from Oct. 18 to 20, has a margin of sampling error of about four percentage points. The Democratic challenger Theresa Greenfield is trailing the Republican incumbent Joni Ernst by only one point in the Iowa Senate race. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of 753 likely voters in Iowa from Oct. 18 to Oct. 20. President Barack Obama carried Iowa twice, but the state swung decisively to Mr. Trump in 2016. But as in other Midwestern states, Mr. Trump’s incendiary conduct has alienated many voters. The president is viewed unfavorably by more than half of likely Iowa voters, and very unfavorably by over half of women and college-educated voters there. Another survey of Iowa, released Wednesday by Monmouth University, found Mr. Biden leading Mr. Trump by 50 to 47 percent among likely voters there. Mr. Biden’s edge, which is within the poll’s margin of error, was calculated using a high-turnout scenario that most observers say is already playing out in early voting and absentee balloting. It also represents a dramatic shift in just the last month: In September, Monmouth found Mr. Trump leading by a 49-to-46 percent margin using the same voter model. The Monmouth poll found Ms. Greenfield narrowly leading Ms. Ernst, by a 49-to-47 percent margin, which was also within the poll’s 4.4 percent margin of error. — Jonathan Martin and Glenn Thrush A man in Maryland has been arrested on charges that he threatened to kidnap and kill Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, law enforcement officials said on Wednesday. A criminal complaint filed by the Secret Service on Wednesday did not describe any steps taken by the man, identified as James Dale Reed, to carry out the alleged threat. It said that on Oct. 4, Mr. Reed approached a house in his hometown, Frederick, Md., northwest of Washington, that had Biden-Harris campaign signs in the yard and left a handwritten note that contained graphic threats against the candidates and their supporters. The resident’s video doorbell had captured an image of the man who left the note, the complaint said. “We are the ones with these scary guns, we are the ones your children have nightmares about,” the note read in part. Mr. Reed, 42, was arrested last Friday and is being held without bond in Frederick County, Md., according to court records. A spokeswoman for the Maryland Office of the Public Defender, which is representing Mr. Reed, declined to comment. He provided a palm print and handwriting sample and acknowledged having written the letter, according to the complaint. He is charged with the federal offense of threatening a major candidate, which carries a penalty of up to five years in prison, and two violations of state law: threatening mass violence and voter intimidation. The complaint said that Mr. Reed was known to law enforcement for making a complaint against a person under Secret Service protection in 2014. Death threats against the United States president and presidential candidates are not uncommon in election years. In another high-profile threat this month, several men were charged with hatching a detailed plan to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a Democrat who has become a focal point of anti-government groups and anger over coronavirus control measures. — Shaila Dewan THE EARLY VOTE Election Day is still almost two weeks away, but more than 40 million Americans have already cast their ballots by mail or at early voting sites — 29 percent of all the votes tallied in the 2016 general election, according to data collected by the United States Elections Project. The high early-voting numbers reflect a combination of motivated voters and an unusual year in which the twin threats of the coronavirus and mail delays have led millions to mail their ballots early or vote early in person. In the battleground state of Wisconsin, which President Trump won by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016, more than one million people have already voted in this election. That is more than a third of the total who voted there in the 2016  election, according to state data collected by Michael P. McDonald, a professor of political science at the University of Florida. Here’s what the data showed as of early Wednesday afternoon: 1,027,585 Wisconsinites have voted so far, which is 34.5 percent of all the votes that were counted there in the 2016 election. Of those, 79,774 voted in person on Tuesday, the first day voters were allowed to cast in-person ballots, as long lines formed at polling stations around the state. The remaining 947,811  have voted by mail, continuing the trend of large numbers of Wisconsinites choosing to vote by mail since the coronavirus began to spread.  — Michael Cooper President Trump held a rally in Georgia on Friday. That he is campaigning in what should be a safely Republican state — and in others that were expected to be solidly in his column, like Iowa and Ohio — is evidence to many Democrats that Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s polling lead in the presidential race is solid and durable. Mr. Trump spent Monday in Arizona, too, a state that was once reliably Republican but where his unpopularity has helped make Mr. Biden competitive. For some Democrats, Mr. Trump’s attention to red states is also a sign of something else — something few in the party want to discuss out loud, given their scars from Mr. Trump’s surprise victory in 2016. It’s an indication that Mr. Biden could pull off a landslide in November, achieving an ambitious and rare electoral blowout that some Democrats think is necessary to quell any doubts — or disputes by Mr. Trump — that Mr. Biden won the election. On one level, such a scenario is entirely plausible based on the weeks and the breadth of public polls that show Mr. Biden with leads or narrow edges in key states. But this possibility runs headlong into the political difficulties of pulling off such a win, and perhaps even more, the psychological hurdles for Democrats to entertain the idea. Many think that Mr. Trump, having pulled off a stunning win before, could do it again, even if there are differences from 2016 that hurt his chances. This much is clear: Landslide presidential victories have become rare — the last big one was in 1988, and a more modest one in 2008 — and Mr. Trump is still ahead of or running closely with Mr. Biden in many of the states he won in 2016 when the margin of error is factored in. Democrats see flipping states like Texas and Georgia as key to a possible landslide; Texas hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1976, and Georgia since 1992. A New York Times and Siena College poll published on Tuesday found Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump tied among likely voters in Georgia. “Until Democrats win a statewide election, we’re not a purple state,” said Brian Robinson, a Republican political consultant in Georgia. “We may be a purpling state. But until they win, this is a red state.” — Astead W. Herndon LeBron James, fresh off the Los Angeles Lakers’ championship, is stepping up his political activities on behalf of More Than a Vote, a voter mobilization group that debuted a rapid response operation on Wednesday to combat misinformation among young Black voters. In an interview, Mr. James talked about the organization’s initiatives, including its recruitment of more than 40,000 poll workers, its efforts to restore voting rights to formerly incarcerated people and a push for N.B.A. arenas to be converted into polling locations. But there was one topic Mr. James had little appetite to address: President Trump, who dismissed his activism and even his intelligence in a baseless and insulting tweet in 2018 and went on to call him “nasty” during an interview with Rush Limbaugh earlier this month. “I don’t go back and forth with anybody,” Mr. James said. “And I damn sure won’t go back and forth with that guy. But we want better, we want change in our community. We always talk about, ‘We want change,’ and now we have the opportunity to do that.” More Than a Vote’s latest partnership, a collaboration with the political organization Win Black, will seek to fight the spread of misinformation with voter education campaigns that are headlined by athletes and celebrities and amplified through Snapchat. The announcement came on the same day the group announced new investments in groups that register formerly incarcerated persons in Michigan, Florida, and North Carolina. Mr. James, who campaigned on behalf of Hillary Clinton in 2016, said has been focused more on issues than candidates in this cycle — less a political decision than a strategy dictated by the rapid pace of events. “We’ve been talking about voter suppression, we’ve been talking about police brutality, systemic racism,” he said. “We’ve had so many things going on, and voter suppression in our communities happens to be at the forefront. So that’s something we wanted to educate our people on.” The rapid-response initiative will seek to educate younger Black voters on how to spot false political statements spreading on social media. The goal is to provide advice that culminates in young people making a plan to vote — either by absentee ballot or in person. Called “Under Review,” the effort will be featured on Snapchat through Election Day, and will include videos from celebrities and activists like Desus and Mero, Jemele Hill and the athletes involved in More Than a Vote. “We believe that Black people, our community, we’ve been pushed away from our civic duty. We’ve been fed misinformation for many years,” added Mr. James, who said his goal is to get young more Black people to the polls. “You know, there’s so many stats out there, you can see it every time,” he said. “Who didn’t vote? What counties didn’t vote? What communities didn’t vote? And a lot of that has had to do with our Black people. So, hopefully, we can get them out and educated and let them understand how important this moment is.” — Astead W. Herndon AD WATCH Seven months into the coronavirus pandemic, America has figured out how to make big-time sports happen. The World Series is taking place in front of a few thousand fans. The N.B.A. crowned a champion last week. Pro football is on TV three days a week, and the top college football leagues are back in action. But many smaller sports conferences are on hold, and that’s the crux of a new Biden campaign ad. Tristen Vance, a linebacker at Northern Arizona University, says that he’s worked his whole life to have a shot at playing professional football, and his dreams were put in jeopardy by the postponement of the fall football season. “Trump’s failure of leadership is why we can’t play right now,” Mr. Vance says in the ad. “I don’t blame President Trump for the virus, but I 100-percent blame him for the response to the virus.” This is core of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s argument in his campaign’s final weeks — one he’s repeating in paid advertising and is expected to return to during Thursday’s final debate: that Mr. Trump has mishandled the national response to the coronavirus and can’t be trusted to make things better. Mr. Vance was hardly a top professional prospect, but the Lumberjacks’ season was moved to the spring, robbing him of whatever chance he had to play his senior college season in time for National Football League scouts to see him before the league’s draft, which is scheduled to start April 29. The ad first aired during the Monday night game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Arizona Cardinals. The campaign plans to air the ad during upcoming football games. Mr. Biden is making this election a referendum on Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus. (This ad isn’t the first one from the Biden campaign lamenting the loss of parts of the college football season.) It’s his best card to play, given that Americans believe by wide margins that the former vice president would do a better job handling the virus. — Reid J. Epstein People in Florida and Alaska reported receiving menacing and deceptive emails on Tuesday that used false claims about public voting information to threaten voters: “Vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you.” (There is no way for any group to know for whom individual voters cast their ballots.) One of the emails, obtained by The New York Times, came from an address that suggested an affiliation with the Proud Boys, a far-right group. But metadata from the email shows that it did not come from the displayed email address — “info@officialproudboys.com” — but instead originated from an Estonian email server. The email obtained by The Times had been sent to a voter in Gainesville, Fla., and was nearly identical to dozens of others that had been reported in the city. Voters in Brevard County, Fla., and Anchorage, Alaska, also reported receiving similar emails. Mayor Lauren Poe of Gainesville said in an interview that the emails were “a very brutish way of trying to intimidate people from going to the polls,” but that none of the voters he had talked to seemed to have been fooled. Federal and local law enforcement authorities in Florida are investigating the emails, and have put out alerts on social media to warn voters. “We here at the Sheriff’s Office and the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections are aware of an email that is circulating, purported to be from the Proud Boys,” the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office wrote on Facebook. “The email appears to be a scam and we will be initiating an investigation into the source of the email along with assistance from our partners on the federal level.” Don Schwinn, 85, a retired environmental engineering consultant and snowbird who is registered as a Democrat in Melbourne Beach, Fla., said in an interview that he received one of the emails on Tuesday afternoon and reported it to the sheriff’s office. He said it was troubling that Mr. Trump had not condemned the Proud Boys when he was asked about the group during his debate last month with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee. “I actually thought it was real. The message was so threatening that it took over,” Mr. Schwinn said. Mr. Schwinn said that he and his wife, who were both registered Republicans before the 2016 election, had already voted by absentee ballot. “In the United States of America, we cannot and will not stand for any behavior that could intimidate voters from participating in our democracy,” the Biden campaign said in a statement. “It’s clear that those running scared will try anything in the closing weeks of the election. There are no excuses for this behavior. We are committed to making sure every Floridian can vote and every vote is counted.” — Nick Corasaniti, Ben Decker, Stephanie Saul and Neil Vigdor  To help spur voters to the polls, most politicians conduct in-person canvassing or send mass emails. But Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took a novel approach: She asked her nine million Twitter followers to watch her play a video game. “Anyone want to play Among Us with me on Twitch to get out the vote?” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, tweeted on Monday afternoon, referring to the popular livestreaming platform. She added that she had never played it “but it looks like a lot of fun.” Among Us is a multiplayer game in which players try to stay alive on an alien spaceship. In a nutshell: Players who are designated as “crewmates” must run around completing a set of tasks while trying to root out and avoid getting killed by other players who are acting as “impostors.” The game was created in 2018 and has soared to popularity during the pandemic. Major streamers, YouTube stars and TikTok influencers now play it for millions of fans. At the peak on Tuesday night, more than 400,000 users were watching Ms. Ocasio-Cortez play Among Us with a handful of popular streamers, making her debut one of the most-watched streams in the service’s history. Her fellow gamers included Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, who suggested in several tweets she was enjoying herself.   When you’re winning: pic.twitter.com/Fu7CMyCQDA As Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s pink “aoc” avatar bounced around the spaceship, a video beneath the action showed the headphone-clad congresswoman smiling as she played — and occasionally gasping when her avatar ran into trouble. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez talked a little about politics — including health care and transgender rights — and the presidential election. She said that she planned to vote in person, rather than by mail, because she wanted her vote counted on Election Day. “Justin Amash just texted me, saying he’s highly entertained,” she said, referring to the former Republican representative from Michigan who left the party last year after clashing with President Trump. “I’m so excited by this upcoming election,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez added a few minutes later. “We can overwhelm the polls, and we can get things back on track.” For the most part, though, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was absorbed in the game itself, and the spaceship where her avatar was competing. At one point she observed that some of its features seemed anachronistic. “What kind of futuristic spaceship still runs a combustion engine?” she asked. “I mean, really?” — Mike Ives DAILY SCHEDULES There are 13 days until Election Day. Here are the schedules of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates for Wednesday, Oct. 21. All times are Eastern time. President Trump 7 p.m.: Holds a rally in Gastonia, N.C. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. No events scheduled; preparing for Thursday’s debate. Vice President Mike Pence 1:30 p.m.: Holds a rally in Portsmouth, N.H. 6 p.m.: Holds a rally in Cincinnati. Senator Kamala Harris 11:55 a.m.: Spoke at an early-vote event in Asheville, N.C. 6:45 p.m.: Speaks at an early-vote event in Charlotte, N.C. Evening: Hosts virtual fund-raising events.  Sam Elliott, a veteran character actor with a signature cinematic drawl, has voiced a new ad portraying Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a healer who believes in “one America” — a stripped-down patriotic appeal likely to become one of the more memorable messages of 2020. The 30-second ad, which aired Tuesday on the first night of the World Series, shows a fluttering American flag as “The Star-Spangled Banner” plays on a piano. “There is only one America — no Democratic rivers, no Republican mountains,” Mr. Elliott says in the soothing tone of Zen-master reassurance he adopted in “The Big Lebowski.”    “There is so much we can do, if we choose to take on problems, and not each other. And choose a president who brings out our best,” Mr. Elliott says. “Joe Biden doesn’t need everyone in this country to always agree. Just to agree we all love this country, and go from there.”  The spot, reminiscent of Bernie Sanders’ 2016 ad set to Simon & Garfunkel’s “America,” is emblematic of Mr. Biden’s core closing strategy — projecting an image of decency, reunification and optimism — as President Trump continues to go scorched earth on his political opponents, Republican dissenters and the media. One of Mr. Biden’s enduring advantages over Mr. Trump is his relatively high personal approval rating, which has hovered in the mid-to-high 40s, roughly at par with his disapproval numbers. The president, whose disapproval ratings remain stuck above 50 percent in many polls — was able to win four years ago, in part, by degrading his opponent Hillary Clinton’s standing with voters rather than increasing his own popularity. — Glenn Thrush President Trump and his allies have tried to paint Joseph R. Biden Jr. as soft on China, in part by pointing to his son’s business dealings there. But Mr. Trump’s own business history is filled with overseas financial deals, and some have involved the Chinese state. He spent a decade unsuccessfully pursuing projects in China, operating an office there during his first run for president and forging a partnership with a major government-controlled company. And it turns out that China is one of only three foreign nations — the others are Britain and Ireland — where Mr. Trump maintains a bank account, according to an analysis of the president’s tax records, which were obtained by The New York Times. The foreign accounts do not show up on Mr. Trump’s public financial disclosures, where he must list personal assets, because they are held under corporate names. The identities of the financial institutions are not clear. The Chinese account is controlled by Trump International Hotels Management L.L.C., which the tax records show paid $188,561 in taxes in China while pursuing licensing deals there from 2013 to 2015. The tax records do not include details on how much money may have passed through the overseas accounts, though the I.R.S. does require filers to report the portion of their income derived from other countries. In response to questions from The Times, Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said the company had “opened an account with a Chinese bank having offices in the United States in order to pay the local taxes” associated with efforts to do business there. He said the company had opened the account after establishing an office in China “to explore the potential for hotel deals in Asia.” “No deals, transactions or other business activities ever materialized and, since 2015, the office has remained inactive,” Mr. Garten said. “Though the bank account remains open, it has never been used for any other purpose.” Mr. Garten would not identify the bank in China where the account is held. Until last year, China’s biggest state-controlled bank rented three floors in Trump Tower, a lucrative lease that drew accusations of a conflict of interest for the president. China continues to be an issue in the 2020 presidential campaign, from the president’s trade war to his barbs over the origin of the coronavirus pandemic. His campaign has tried to portray Mr. Biden as a “puppet” of China who, as vice president, misread the dangers posed by its growing power. Mr. Trump has also sought to tar his opponent with overblown or unsubstantiated assertions about Hunter Biden’s business dealings there while his father was in office. As for the former vice president, his public financial disclosures, along with the income tax returns he voluntarily released, show no income or business dealings of his own in China. However, there is ample evidence of Mr. Trump’s efforts to join the myriad American firms that have long done business there — and the tax records for him and his companies that were obtained by The Times offer new details about them. Jo Becker contributed reporting. — Mike McIntire, Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig Until a month ago, the biggest-spending Democratic super PAC in the general election had aired only a single television ad during the campaign. Now the group, Future Forward, is on pace to spend more than $108 million on television ads supporting Joe Biden and two Senate candidates, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. The group is barreling into the race a month after Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and presidential candidate, pledged to spend $100 million to support Mr. Biden — exclusively in Florida. And Priorities USA, one of the biggest and oldest Democratic super PACs, has already spent $66 million since the start of the general election. The result is yet another yawning advantage on the airwaves for Mr. Biden, who has already outspent President Trump in TV advertising by a nearly 2-to-1 margin since the general election kicked off in earnest in April. With outside groups factored in, Democratic spending in the presidential campaign has reached nearly $400 million for the final month of the race, compared with nearly $200 million in Republican spending, according to Advertising Analytics. Here is a visual comparison of spending on advertisements by the Biden and Trump teams. Joe Biden is vastly outspending President Trump in TV advertising, maintaining a nearly 2-to-1 advantage on the airwaves. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
