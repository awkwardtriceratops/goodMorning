Several people went to hospitals after a Trump rally in Omaha where hundreds were stranded in the cold. Democrats target the true silent majority in Georgia: people who don’t vote. The election’s big twist: the racial gap between Republicans and Democrats is shrinking. Over 73 million Americans have already voted. There have been over 300 lawsuits, in 44 states, over voting rules. Here’s the latest. Trump calls $270 million in forgiven debt on his Chicago skyscraper ‘an appropriately great deal.’ Trump made them furious, and organized. Now is the big test. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. filled Democrats with hope and fear when he announced as the week began that he would be campaigning in Iowa and Georgia, in addition to more traditional end-of-race stops in Wisconsin and Florida. As Mr. Biden campaigned on Tuesday in a region of Georgia that is filled with signs and flags supporting President Trump, nervous Democrats had unpleasant flashbacks to 2016, when Hillary Clinton famously invested resources and visited Arizona in the final days of the race, while failing to set foot in Wisconsin. Risk-averse Democratic voters wondered: Why wasn’t Mr. Biden simply spending the rest of his waking hours until Nov. 3 living in Pennsylvania, with its trove of 20 electoral votes, almost as many as Georgia and Iowa put together? There was no need to spike any footballs — just a need for the campaign to avoid losing. The Trump campaign tried to paint Mr. Biden as overly confident, just as Mrs. Clinton was four years ago. “We encourage him to spend time and resources in Georgia, where the president is definitely going to win,” said Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign communications director. “He’s wasting time in states he can’t win.” Meanwhile, the Trump campaign deployed Melania Trump, the first lady, to Atglen, Pa., a very rare campaign stop — the only one this year — for one of the president’s most popular surrogates, who doesn’t particularly like campaigning. Mr. Trump spent Tuesday shoring up support in states in the Midwest, with rallies in Michigan, Wisconsin and Nebraska. Other Democrats, however, said they were encouraged that the Biden campaign felt comfortable enough to devote resources to states like Georgia and Texas, forcing Mr. Trump’s campaign to use some of its limited cash to play defense in Georgia, while still spending on targeted ads in Pennsylvania and Florida. And they noted that Mr. Biden appeared to be adding to his schedule states with important Senate seats where Democrats have a victory within reach. The race between Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, and her Democratic challenger, Theresa Greenfield, is the most expensive Senate race the state has ever seen. In Georgia, two well-funded Democratic candidates, Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, are running competitive races for the state’s two Senate seats. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, was set to make two campaign stops in Arizona on Wednesday, pursuing his narrow path to victory. His campaign, however, noted that he will also travel this week to New Hampshire and Nevada, states Mrs. Clinton won four years ago. — Annie Karni OMAHA —  After hundreds of people who attended a Trump rally in Omaha Tuesday night were left stranded on an airport tarmac for hours in near-freezing temperatures, at least six people were taken to a hospital and about two dozen others sought medical attention, according to local authorities, rally attendees and reports from journalists at the scene. President Trump had traveled to Eppley Airfield to fight for the area’s single electoral vote, which could determine the outcome of a close national election, and buses shuttled thousands of rally attendees from a parking lot to the event site over a 10-hour period on Tuesday, airport and city police officials said. After the rally ended around 9 p.m., people “flooded” the available buses waiting to take them back to their cars, said Officer Michael Pecha of the Omaha police. “Due to the size of the crowd and security requirements, return transportation took time,” Tim Conahan, the Chief of Police at the Omaha Airport Authority, said in an email on Wednesday. Officer Pecha said additional buses were called in from the area’s transit agency and that last person at the site boarded around 11:50 p.m. Roughly 30 people requested medical attention during and after the rally, Officer Pecha said. He said that about a half-dozen people were transported to hospitals “with a variety of medical conditions.” Mr. Conahan said the number was six. Thousands of people left out in the cold and stranded in #Omaha, #Nebraska after a #Trump rally. I’m told the shuttles aren’t operating & there aren’t enough busses. Police didn’t seem to know what to do. Some walked. I saw at least one woman getting medical attention. pic.twitter.com/oIkmixaZt0 Joseph R. Biden Jr. seized on the mishap Wednesday as he gave a speech in Wilmington, Del., criticizing the president’s handling of the coronavirus. “Just look at what happened last night in Omaha after Trump — after the Trump rally ended,” Mr. Biden said. “Hundreds of people, including older Americans and children, were stranded in subzero freezing temperatures for hours. Several folks ended up in the hospital. It’s an image that captures President Trump’s whole approach to this crisis.” Dillon Bloedorn, a farmer who had driven 80 miles to attend the rally, said he was among the first round of people to leave the event and found that “a wall of people was pushing up there” and that he did not get onto a bus until around 11:30.. The first set of buses loaded quickly and took off, he said, but more buses failed to turn up. “Maybe it wasn’t real organized,” he said. Those stranded included older people and children. When more buses arrived, the people who remained made sure they were the first to load, Mr. Bloedorn said. In a statement, Samantha Zager, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign said that because of the size of the crowd, the campaign had deployed 40 shuttle buses to the event — roughly twice the usual number. “But local road closures and resulting congestion caused delays,” Ms. Zager said. “We always strive to provide the best guest experience at our events and we care about their safety.” Earlier Tuesday, the police posted a warning on Facebook, noting that the allocated parking for the Trump rally was full and that the event would not be accessible “by foot, Uber, cab or any other means of transportation.” The drive from the parking lot to the tarmac where the event was held was 3.7 miles. Officer Pecha and Chief Conahan said many people decided to walk back to the parking areas instead of waiting for a bus, and that the foot traffic slowed bus traffic. Some officers gave rides to older attendees, Officer Pecha said. “Many people,” he said, “underestimated the distance from the event back to the parking lot on foot.” — Dionne Searcey, Matt Stevens, Daniel Victor and Thomas Kaplan Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s late-in-the-race trip yesterday to Georgia, a state that has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1992, struck some members of both parties as curious. But a Monmouth University poll released Wednesday highlighted the dynamic that emboldened the campaign to make the gambit, finding that Mr. Biden had gained ground on President Trump and held a small, statistically insignificant edge over the president among likely voters. Among all registered voters in Georgia, the poll found, Mr. Biden is supported by 50 percent and Mr. Trump by 45 percent. And among the voters that the pollsters categorized as likely to vote in a high-turnout election, Mr. Biden has an edge over Mr. Trump by 50 percent to 46 percent, though that lead falls within the poll’s margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. More than three million people have already voted in Georgia. The Monmouth University poll found that Mr. Biden was leading Mr. Trump among those who said that they had already voted by 55 percent to 43 percent, but that Mr. Trump had an edge of 48 percent to 44 percent among those who have not yet voted. The poll of 504 registered voters was conducted from Oct. 23 to 27. Senator David Perdue, a Republican, has lost his lead over his Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff, the poll found, with Mr. Ossoff backed by 49 percent of registered voters and Mr. Perdue by 46 percent. (Mr. Perdue had led by 6 points in Monmouth polls in September and July). And this year Georgia has another Senate race, a special election to fill the seat once held by Johnny Isakson. The Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, has pulled into a clear lead with the support of 41 percent of registered voters, the poll found, while Senator Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed to the seat earlier this year, has the support of 21 percent and Representative Doug Collins has the support of 18 percent. There will be a runoff if no candidate gets over 50 percent of the vote. — Michael Cooper Over 100 million eligible, voting-age Americans did not vote in 2016, more than the number who voted for either presidential candidate. In Georgia, about 60 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot in that year’s presidential race, roughly on par with the national figure of 55 percent. As Democrats eye Georgia for possible gains this November — the first step toward a larger goal of remaking their path to victory in statewide races throughout the South — high turnout will be the name of the game, and that means persuading nonvoters to become voters. In traditional swing states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, most political observers believe that turnout is largely fixed and that campaigns rise and fall based on their ability to persuade a set of voters. But in the new set of battleground states in the South, as well as Arizona in the Southwest, the priority is converting nonvoters into voters. The thinking goes: If the party is able to reshape the electorate with new arrivals to the state — including young people, Latinos and Asian-Americans — as well as greater participation from Black residents and immigrants, a red state becomes a blue one. But experts who study nonvoting populations and the failed Democratic campaigns of recent years warn that the work of changing electorates is hard and complicated. There is no such thing, they say, as an inevitable demographic destiny. Nse Ufot, the executive director of the New Georgia Project, a nonpartisan group that has sought to turn out voters among the state’s new residents, said that doing so in a meaningful way could not happen with “five-minute conversations that you have on people’s porches.” “It is a sustained campaign that requires smart targeting, messaging and research,” she said. — Astead W. Herndon The Trump administration will officially open up about nine million acres of the pristine woodlands of Alaska’s Tongass National Forest to logging and road construction this week, following up on last month’s announcement of its plan to do so. The expected publication in the Federal Register of the United States Forest Service’s move to lift protections in more than half of the 17-million-acre Tongass, the nation’s largest national forest, is the final step in a process that has been in the works for about two years. It comes after years of prodding by successive Alaska governors and congressional delegations, which pushed the federal government to exempt the Tongass from a Clinton-era policy known as the roadless rule, which banned logging and road construction in much of the national forest system. Scientists and environmentalists have said that lifting protections on the Tongass effectively ignores the government’s own scientific findings about the value of the land, which is the world’s largest temperate rainforest and a major “carbon sink,” sucking up and storing climate-warming carbon dioxide pollution. The move comes as President Trump wraps up a first term in which he rolled back or weakened more than 100 environmental regulations and is part of his broader push to remove protections across Alaska’s wilderness. The administration has also opened up the 19-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling, and this year proposed to open almost all of the National Petroleum Reserve, far to the west of the refuge, to additional drilling. But like many of those rollbacks, the protections to the Tongass could be fairly easily reinstated by a future president. — Coral Davenport American politicians have often sought to exploit the nation’s racial and ethnic divides for political gain. During the Trump era, voters are not responding as expected. The gap in presidential vote preference between white and nonwhite voters has shrunk by 16 percentage points since 2016, according to an analysis by The Upshot, as Joseph R. Biden Jr. gains among white voters and President Trump makes inroads with Black and Hispanic voters. +60 Democrat 80 points Polling margin among nonwhite voters Size of the racial polarization gap +40 60 +42 Dem. 40 +20 Even 20 +5 Rep.

Polls show that many white voters have been repelled by his handling of race, policing and protests. The decrease in racial polarization defies the expectations of many analysts. It may also upset the hopes of some activists on the left who viewed an embrace of more progressive policies on race would give Democrats overwhelming support from nonwhite voters, reducing the need to cater to the more conservative white voters who backed Mr. Trump four years ago. Instead, Mr. Biden leads because of gains among those very voters. The president’s pitch hasn’t resonated even among the kinds of voters who seem likeliest to be receptive. Trish Thompson, 69, a white Republican who works as a security guard for pipeline and fracking lands in Brownsville, Texas, is switching from Mr. Trump to Mr. Biden because of what she called the president’s “appalling” coronavirus response and “his misogynistic behavior and his inability to acknowledge his racial discrimination.” Over all, Mr. Trump leads among white voters by only five points in high-quality surveys conducted since August, compared with a 13-point advantage in the final surveys in 2016. Mr. Biden has tended to make his largest gains in Northern states, where the president made his largest gains four years ago. Mr. Trump’s support has proved resilient in the Sun Belt, bolstered by perhaps the single most surprising demographic trend of the cycle: his gains among nonwhite voters. In recent national polls, Mr. Biden leads by 42 points among nonwhite voters. That is a lot, but it is about nine points worse than Mrs. Clinton’s lead in the final 2016 surveys. New York Times/Siena College surveys suggest that the president’s gains are particularly significant among Hispanic voters. Mr. Biden holds only an 84-7 lead among Hispanic voters who said they backed Mrs. Clinton four years ago, compared with a 93-2 lead among Black voters and a 94-3 lead among white voters. Mr. Biden has lost almost exactly as much ground among nonwhite voters as he has gained among white voters, but because white voters vastly outnumber nonwhite voters in the most important battleground states, the trade-off favors him. — Nate Cohn In a victory for Gov. Greg Abbott, the all-Republican Texas Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld his order to restrict Texas counties to only one drop-off site for mail-in ballots. With Election Day less than a week away, the ruling gives Mr. Abbott, a Republican, what appears to be the last word in a legal battle that has meandered through both federal and state courts through much of October. The Supreme Court decision and a ruling by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals this month overturned lower court rulings that sided with voting rights advocates who said Mr. Abbott’s order amounted to unconstitutional voter suppression. “We knew it was coming,” said Susan Hays, legal counsel for the Harris County Clerk’s Office in Houston, which opposed the order. “We don’t expect anything to change between now and the election.” Mr. Abbott said his Oct. 1 order limiting ballot drop boxes to one per county enhanced election security, and he maintained that he was expanding voter access by extending early voting from two to nearly three weeks, ending on Friday. But Democratic-backed lawsuits by civil rights groups and voting rights organizations contended that reducing the number of ballot drop-off sites imposed hardships on older and disabled Texans and increased voters’ potential risk of exposure to the coronavirus. Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas, a Republican, issued a statement praising the ruling, saying the decision “rightfully bolsters the security of dropped-off ballots” and “preserved election integrity.” But Democrats blasted the ruling and said it was an incentive to propel their voters to the polls. “The Texas Republican Supreme Court continues to bend the law in any which way to secure Republican political power,” said Gilberto Hinojosa, the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party. “The only option for free and fair government is to vote Democrat all the way down the ballot.” — David Montgomery With six days still to go until Election Day, the flood of people moved to cast their ballots early has grown so strong that the early vote has already exceeded half of the number of votes that were counted during the entire 2016 presidential election, according to data compiled by the United States Elections Project. The coronavirus pandemic, the fear of postal delays and the passions inspired by the presidential candidates, both pro and con, have all contributed to the record early vote. As of Wednesday morning, more than 73 million Americans had already voted early in person or had their mail-in ballots received by election officials, according to the data compiled by the project. That is nearly 53 percent of the overall turnout of 138 million for the 2016 election. The early vote is even more dramatic in a number of battleground states, including several that polls have suggested are unusually close this year. Texas has already received over 90 percent of the votes it counted in the 2016 election, North Carolina and Georgia have already received more than three-quarters, and Florida more than 70 percent. Wisconsin passed the halfway mark Wednesday morning and Michigan is nearing it. “The numbers are stunning,” Michael P. McDonald, a professor of political science at the University of Florida who gathers the data for the elections project, wrote in a recent analysis for the United States Elections Project, which tracks the early vote closely. Not all states report the party affiliations of those who vote early. Those which do show a dichotomy in how the members of the two major parties choose to vote, though: Democrats have been much more likely to vote early by mail than Republicans, while Republicans have been a bit more likely to vote early in person than Democrats. President Trump has repeatedly railed against mail-in voting, making baseless claims that it is subject to fraud. This trend means that the in-person vote reported on Election Day is more likely to show early Republican leads, and that Democrats may gain ground as absentee votes are tabulated in the days afterward. Campaign officials and elections experts are still trying to determine the extent to which the high turnout so far reflects voters simply casting their ballots earlier than they normally would and to what extent it reflects high enthusiasm that could translate into a record turnout. Dr. McDonald wrote in his analysis that the pace of early voting in some states suggests that they could surpass their 2016 vote totals this week. More than 71 million ballots have already been cast in the general election. More Democrats are voting early by mail than Republicans. — Michael Cooper DAILY SCHEDULES There are six days until Election Day. Here are the daily schedules of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates for Wednesday, Oct. 28. All times are Eastern time. President Trump 2 p.m.: Holds a rally in Bullhead City, Ariz. 4:30 p.m.: Holds a rally in Goodyear, Ariz. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Morning: Receives a briefing from public health experts and delivers remarks on the coronavirus and health care policy. Afternoon: Attends a virtual campaign fund-raising event. Vice President Mike Pence 4 p.m.: Holds a rally in Mosinee, Wis. 7 p.m.: Holds a rally in Flint, Mich. Senator Kamala Harris Morning: Meets with Latina business owners in Tucson, Ariz., then speaks at a rally. Afternoon: Meets with a group of Black leaders in Phoenix and speaks at a rally with Alicia Keys. — Matt Stevens In almost every instance in the ongoing struggle over voting rights, Democrats are trying to make it easier for Americans to cast ballots, and Republicans are trying to make it harder. Much of the fight involves voting by mail, which many people would prefer to do this year to minimize their risk of contracting the coronavirus. Lawyers have already filed more than 300 lawsuits, across 44 states, over issues related to voting in the pandemic. The most important cases are in the battleground states on which the presidential election or Senate control could hinge. Pennsylvania: The state’s highest court has ruled that election officials should count mailed ballots that arrive up to three days after Election Day. Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to get the Supreme Court to reverse the order, so that only ballots received by Election Day will count. North Carolina: Republicans and the Trump campaign have asked the Supreme Court to block the state’s board of elections from extending the deadline to receive mail ballots. The board has said ballots can arrive until Nov. 12, as long as they were mailed by Election Day. Wisconsin: The five Republican-appointed justices on the Supreme Court sided on Monday with Republican officials in Wisconsin, ruling that ballots must arrive by 8 p.m. on election night to count. (A lower-court ruling would have let state officials count any mailed ballots postmarked by Election Day and received up to six days later.) In response, the state’s Democratic Party is urging voters to return mail ballots  to drop boxes or clerk’s offices, rather than mail them. Nevada: The Trump campaign has sued to stop the counting of absentee ballots in the Las Vegas area, evidently hoping to challenge the signatures on many ballots. Tuesday night, the campaign and the Nevada Republican Party filed a separate suit seeking detailed information on the vote-counting process. Texas: The state’s top court on Tuesday upheld a policy announced by Greg Abbott, the Republican governor, limiting each county to a single drop-off box for mailed ballots. The state’s largest county — Harris, which includes Houston — is home to 4.7 million people. Michigan: A conservative judge on Tuesday overturned an order by Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, and ruled that people could carry unconcealed guns at polling places on Election Day. In many of these cases, Republicans have claimed baselessly that changing voting rules because of the pandemic could lead to fraud, and that allowing ballots to be counted after Election Day leads to confusion and chaos. Democrats have argued that protecting people’s right to vote during a national helath crisis should be the top priority. They have also pointed out that some Republicans have changed their position on the counting of mailed ballots: When late-arriving ballots seemed likely to help George W. Bush in Florida in 2000, Republicans argued that the state should count them. — David Leonhardt Years before he became president, Donald J. Trump got a very sweet deal from some very big financial institutions. First, they agreed to lend him a total of $770 million to build a 92-story skyscraper in downtown Chicago. Then, when the 2008 financial crisis hit and Mr. Trump defaulted on his loans, those same banks and hedge funds either gave him years more to repay his loans or simply forgave much of what he owed. The Internal Revenue Service considers such forgiven debts to be taxable income, but Mr. Trump managed to avoid paying almost any taxes. On Wednesday, after The New York Times reported on the project’s travails, Mr. Trump defended his handling of the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago. “I was able to make an appropriately great deal with the numerous lenders on a large and very beautiful tower,” the president wrote on Twitter. “Doesn’t that make me a smart guy rather than a bad guy?” As a developer long ago, and continuing to this day, the politicians ran Chicago into the ground. I was able to make an appropriately great deal with the numerous lenders on a large and very beautiful tower. Doesn’t that make me a smart guy rather than a bad guy? There is no question that the deal was a great one for Mr. Trump. His lenders — including Deutsche Bank and Fortress Investment Group, the hedge fund and private equity firm — had the right to seize the building as collateral but opted not to. Their conclusion was that it would be simpler and safer to reach a peaceful resolution to the dispute with the litigious and publicity-seeking reality-TV star. As a result, about $270 million of debt that Mr. Trump owed to Fortress and other private equity firms and hedge funds was wiped away. Mr. Trump still owes Deutsche Bank a total of at least $330 million, including $45 million on the Chicago project. Those Deutsche Bank loans, which Mr. Trump has personally guaranteed, are due in 2023 and 2024. In his tweet on Tuesday, Mr. Trump implied that his Chicago tower’s struggles were the result of politicians having run the city “into the ground.” That is revisionist history. Mr. Trump and his daughter Ivanka have repeatedly boasted that the skyscraper was a great place to live. “I love Chicago” was the headline on a piece Mr. Trump wrote for The Chicago Tribune about his building in 2014. The reality is that Mr. Trump’s hotel-and-condo tower has struggled compared to other nearby buildings — in part because of the tarnished Trump brand. Retailers balked at renting space in the skyscraper’s mezzanine interior. The Real Deal noted last year that the tower only had one retail client and called the skyscraper “Chicago retail’s biggest failure.” — David Enrich With lines stretching several blocks and voters waiting hours to cast ballots, the New York City Board of Elections said it would expand early voting hours. As of Tuesday, 457,735 city residents had voted early, according to an unofficial tally of voting check-ins on the elections board website. “We are aware that this unprecedented volume needs to be addressed,” Michael Ryan, the board’s executive director, said during a board meeting on Tuesday. Poll sites were open as early as 7 a.m. on weekdays and as late as 8 p.m., depending on the day. But they will now be open by 7 a.m. this weekend as well, instead of 10 a.m, and they will close on Friday and Saturday at 5 p.m., rather than at 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. The new hours were subject to the cooperation of the various institutions hosting early polling sites. Several of them are in city buildings. Mayor Bill de Blasio recommended expanded hours for polling sites on Monday, and a spokesman for the mayor said the city would cooperate. The board’s decision to expand the hours came a day after Robert A. Brehm, the co-executive director of New York State’s elections board, ordered all local boards to bring wait times into compliance with state standards. “While the current voter enthusiasm is higher than anticipated, boards with voter wait times exceeding thirty minutes must work to come into compliance with the early voting wait time standard,” Mr. Brehm wrote. This is the first presidential election in which New York State has had early voting. — Dana Rubinstein Carolyn Gibbs puts on the striped pants first, then the striped jacket. The hat is the final touch. That’s if it’s an Uncle Sam day. For Statue of Liberty, it’s a mint green dress, a foam halo and a political sign, usually, standing in as the torch. Before Donald Trump became president, Ms. Gibbs, 59, rarely dressed up for Halloween, only occasionally for a costume party. But for the better part of four years, she has shown up to rallies in shopping centers of suburban Pittsburgh in elaborate costumes, ready for the role of playful protester. “I’m willing to make a fool of myself for democracy,” is how she often puts it. Yet for all her playfulness — and it is boundless — Ms. Gibbs is driven by a sense of anger and residual shock. How could so many of her neighbors in western Pennsylvania vote for a man she saw as a threat? She still finds herself stuck on the question. “I had begun to think we were including and serving everybody in this country,” Ms. Gibbs said. “But that’s totally not true anymore.” For the past four years, Ms. Gibbs and half a dozen women (along with one man) have poured countless hours into Progress PA, a political group they created to get Democratic candidates elected in western Pennsylvania, a part of the state that helped fuel Mr. Trump’s victory last time. Joseph R. Biden Jr. is counting on voters like them — older, suburban dwellers — to win back Pennsylvania, where polls show him ahead. But their work is less about their enthusiasm for the former vice president than their revulsion at the current occupant of the White House. Before the Trump era, these women were hardly radical. Many have voted for Republicans, including George W. Bush. They represent not just the kind of feminist activism that Mr. Trump’s victory ignited, but the particular had-it-up-to-here-with-my-Republican-neighbors anger of suburban western Pennsylvania, where dozens of similar groups have cropped up in the past four years. “I had never had this kind of burning unquestioning desire to do something myself,” Stacey Vernallis, 60, said, of her political life before 2016. “I was always willing to let it be another person’s job and just be a voter and maybe a donor.” — Jennifer Medina Traveling through hundreds of miles in the Midwest battlegrounds of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and western Pennsylvania, the New York Times photographer Ruth Fremson documented a transformation of the American suburbs. Lawns are packed with campaign signs, leaving no doubt where residents stand in the presidential contest. Supporters of President Trump have decked out their homes with banners and flags as if decorating for Halloween or Christmas. The smaller signs for Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, are more a period than an exclamation point on his supporters’ determination to turn the tide in November. Americans living outside the United States have been making plans to vote in the general election since the summer. But amid the coronavirus pandemic and global mail disruptions, their ballots still may not arrive in time to be counted on Nov. 3. And recent Supreme Court decisions mean that late arrivals in some states will not be counted at all. Of the 7.7 million military service members and other American citizens living overseas, more than 630,000 returned ballots in 2016. Nearly half of those votes were in battleground states, where close races sometimes come down to absentee ballots. More than 30 states allow overseas voters to return ballots by fax, online or both, including states like Missouri that amended their rules this year because of the pandemic. But the rest of the states accept ballots only by mail. Postal delays persist overseas, and once a ballot arrives in the United States it can take weeks more to reach its final destination. Last month, a group of 10 Americans living in seven countries sued election officials in seven mail-only states — Georgia, Kentucky, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin — arguing that having to return their ballots by mail this year effectively deprived them of the right to vote. They requested a court order that the seven states allow overseas voters to return their ballots by email or fax. Benjamin Cole, a Ph.D. student in Germany, had no problem voting from abroad in 2016 and 2018 for elections in Georgia, where he lived before moving overseas. But this year, concerned about mail delays in the pandemic, he took his completed ballot to the post office in Cologne the same day he received it on Sept. 16. Over the next weeks he tracked it to New York and then to Georgia, where it stopped at a sorting facility in Macon on Sept. 27. On Sept. 28, 29 and 30 he received notifications that his ballot was in transit to its final destination in Warner Robins, about 20 minutes away. Then nothing. Mr. Cole worried for weeks about the fate of his ballot. Finally, he checked the state election website and learned that it had been received on Oct. 2. According to the U.S. Postal Service, his ballot is still in transit. “It’s really, really frustrating to me,” Mr. Cole, who is coordinating get-out-the-vote efforts for his local chapter of Democrats Abroad, said of the obstacles facing voters this year. — Jennifer Jett Pennsylvania’s top election on Wednesday urged voters who have not yet mailed back their absentee ballots to deliver them to a drop box or county election office rather than rely on the Postal Service, as a court fight over ballot deadlines looms. “At this point, we are not recommending that anybody put their ballots in the mail,” Kathy Boockvar, Pennsylvania’s secretary of state, said on Wednesday. Though state election officials have already received 65 percent of the absentee ballots that were sent out, there are still about 1 million ballots outstanding. Pennsylvania, which Donald Trump won by less than 45,000 votes in 2016, is widely seen as one of the most important states for both the president and Joseph R. Biden Jr. Ballots that are postmarked by Election Day but received up to three days after it can be accepted by elected officials under current state rules. But Republicans, who have already failed in an attempt to overturn that rule at the Supreme Court once, have issued a new challenge with the apparent plan of appearing before the court now that the conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett has been seated. Republicans are also feeling more confident in their case after the Supreme Court refused to extend a deadline beyond Election Day for counting absentee ballots in Wisconsin. — Nick Corasaniti AD WATCH For months, President Trump has tried to squeeze Joseph R. Biden Jr. from both sides on racial justice issues. While he’s made unfettered loyalty to police officers a cental tenet of his campaign, Mr. Trump has also sought to damage Mr. Biden’s standing with Black voters with reminders of the 1994 crime bill Mr. Biden wrote, parts of which the former vice president says he now regrets. In Michigan, which message voters see depends on where they live. Tuesday morning in Grand Rapids, viewers saw a Trump campaign ad slamming Mr. Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, for “refusing to strongly condemn violence” as “America’s cities burned” in the unrest following the police killing of George Floyd. Two white men identified as veteran police officers warned that “we’ll all be in danger” if Mr. Biden is president. At the same hour in Detroit, the Trump campaign debuted an ad featuring clips of then-Senator Biden making the case for the 1994 crime bill, which included mandatory minimum sentences that increased mass incarceration. “It doesn’t matter whether they’re the victims of society,” Mr. Biden is seen saying on the Senate floor. “The end result is they are about to knock my mother on the head, shoot my sister, beat up my wife, take on my sons.” At the end, a voice says: “We know who Joe Biden is talking about: Us. Don’t let him become president.” It is not true that Mr. Biden didn’t condemn the violence that accompanied street protests this spring and summer. “Burning down communities is not protest, it’s needless violence,” Mr. Biden said in August after Jacob Blake was shot by police in Kenosha, Wis., while also condemning racism. But it is true that Mr. Biden, in the 1990s, described perpetrators using language that racial justice advocates find offensive today. These ads appeared on television in Michigan. Mr. Trump has rarely allowed himself to be governed by ideological consistency. Arguing simultaneously that Mr. Biden is responsible for arresting too many Black people and that he sides too much with Black protesters puts the president on attack in opposing directions. It makes sense in that his path to victory lies in both depressing Black turnout for Mr. Biden and in juicing turnout among his white working-class base, who tend to support law enforcement. Mr. Trump has indeed made some inroads among Black and Hispanic voters, but polls show he has lost significant ground among his white voters since 2016. To win, he needs to maintain his gains among nonwhite voters and come close to repeating his commanding margins from his political base. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
