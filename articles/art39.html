Trump tweets support for California G.O.P., which installed unauthorized ballot drop boxes that state officials call illegal. A poll in North Carolina finds voters distrustful of Trump and Tillis. Lindsey Graham, running for re-election, says his reference to ‘the good old days of segregation’ was sarcastic. Obama plans to hit the road for Biden. But first, a podcast. Four years later, Trump is still pushing the issue of Hillary Clinton’s emails, putting Pompeo in a difficult spot. A judge extends Virginia’s voter registration deadline after Tuesday’s outage. What Kamala Harris learned about power at Howard University. George Floyd’s sister Bridgett calls Biden ‘the change we need’ in a new ad. An estimated 5.2 million Americans cannot vote in the 2020 election because they have been convicted of felonies, according to a report released Wednesday by the Sentencing Project — a number that most likely depresses turnout for Democrats. Only about a quarter of those people are actually incarcerated, the report says, and more than 4 in 10 have completed their full sentence but remain barred from the polls. The United States is an outlier in permitting the denial of voting rights to people who are former felons, and the specific provisions governing the restoration of those rights vary widely from state to state. Felony disenfranchisement occurs at higher rates in the South, and is generally believed to hurt Democrats on balance, in part because a disproportionate number of those barred from voting are Black, and Black voters make up a significant part of the Democratic base. The new report found that Black Americans are disenfranchised by felony records at almost four times the rate of others. In seven states — Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wyoming — more than one in seven Black adults are disenfranchised, it found. That is more than twice the national average of Black felony disenfranchisement. Thanks to state actions expanding the restoration of voting rights, the total number of people barred from voting is down by 15 percent from the 2016 presidential election, when the Sentencing Project, which tracks incarceration data and advocates for a “fair and effective” criminal justice system, estimated that 6.2 million people were blocked. In the past four years, several states have removed some barriers to voting, including Colorado, Louisiana, Nevada, New Jersey and Wyoming. Governors in Iowa, Kentucky, Virginia and New York have restored voting rights to large categories of people through blanket executive orders. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, for example, has granted 61,075 people on parole the right to vote, according to the state corrections department. Georgia edged out Florida as the state with the highest rate of felony disenfranchisement, according to the report, but Florida still leads the country in the sheer number of those disenfranchised, an estimated 1.1 million people. In 2018, Florida voters overwhelmingly approved a measure to restore voting rights after completion of sentence, but the state legislature has since blocked anyone who has failed to pay court-ordered fines and fees from regaining the right to vote. — Shaila Dewan President Trump on Wednesday expressed support to California Republicans who installed more than 50 unauthorized absentee-ballot drop boxes falsely labeled “official” — an extraordinary endorsement by a president of a practice that state officials say is deceptive and illegal. “Fight hard Republicans,” Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet that linked to an article about California state officials demanding the removal of the unauthorized boxes. California’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, has given the state Republican Party until Thursday to remove the boxes, which are labeled “Official Ballot Drop Off Box” or “Ballot Drop Box” and have been placed near churches, gun shops and party offices in Los Angeles, Orange and Fresno Counties over the last two weeks. The party has refused to remove the boxes or even place disclaimers on them. To the average voter, the gray metal boxes are virtually indistinguishable from drop-off sites established by the state, which are governed by strict regulations intended to prevent the partisan manipulation or theft of ballots. This is not the first time Mr. Trump has advised his supporters to contravene the law or state regulations to undermine the integrity of the election or erode faith in the process. In September, he suggested that North Carolinians stress-test the security of their elections systems by voting twice — an act that constitutes the kind of voter fraud the president has railed against. In recent months, a handful of states and local governments, most of them controlled by Democrats, have expanded the use of drop boxes as a safe alternative to voting in person during the coronavirus pandemic, and Republicans have tried to reverse those efforts through state orders or lawsuits. Mr. Trump has repeatedly slammed Democrats for a practice known as “ballot harvesting” — the collection of assigning a third party to collect batches of voter ballots. But on Monday, Hector Barajas, a spokesman for the California Republican Party, said the party’s actions were legal because state law did not restrict them from collecting voters’ completed ballots. He blamed Democrats for blocking Republicans from making the third-party collection of ballots illegal. Mr. Trump seized on that point on Wednesday, tweeting, Democrats “have been taking advantage of the system for years!” But the placement of the boxes go beyond anything either party has done, and Mr. Becerra said he would consider pressing criminal charges or seeking a civil court ruling against the party. “This is like nothing I have ever seen before,” Mr. Becerra, a Democrat, said in a phone interview on Tuesday, contending that state Republicans were trying to stir up confusion around drop boxes. “You want people to have confidence in the system, to know that if you submit a ballot it will be counted. How can you do this at a time when people are losing faith in the process?” — Glenn Thrush With a half-million votes already cast, President Trump and Senator Thom Tillis trail their Democratic challengers in North Carolina, according to a new poll from The New York Times and Siena College, signaling potential trouble for Republicans in a state critical to both the presidential race and the battle for control of the Senate. Joe Biden leads Donald Trump in North Carolina, a state Mr. Trump won in 2016. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of 627 likely voters in North Carolina from Oct. 9 to Oct.13. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. leads Mr. Trump among likely voters, 46 percent to 42 percent, while Mr. Tillis is behind Cal Cunningham, his Democratic challenger, 41 percent to 37 percent. Both leads are within the poll’s margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, leads his Republican challenger, Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, more comfortably, 51 percent to 37 percent. The poll was conducted within the last few days, well after Mr. Cunningham offered an awkward public apology for the romantic (but PG-rated) texts he sent this summer to a woman who is not his wife. It found that Mr. Cunningham, a former state senator and an Iraq war veteran, retains a 15-point advantage among women. Democrats are hoping that Mr. Cunningham will be one of at least four challengers the party needs to win Republican-held seats to take control of the Senate. While Mr. Cunningham has seen the percentage of likely voters who viewers him unfavorably jump in the last month from 29 percent to 41 percent, the new poll found that he and Mr. Tillis are viewed as untrustworthy by the same portion of  voters: 48 percent. Mr. Cunningham’s five-point lead over Mr. Tillis in the Times/Siena poll has held steady since early September, but there is still time and room for the race to shift: 15 percent of voters surveyed said they remained undecided in the Senate race — nearly twice as many as those who said they were undecided in the presidential contest in North Carolina. Mr. Biden’s standing in North Carolina, a state that Mr. Trump won by almost four points in 2016,  is consistent with the leads he has built in other battleground states. The former vice president has significant advantages among women and suburbanites, and is far more trusted to deal with the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus. Early in-person voting begins in North Carolina on Thursday. — Reid J. Epstein and Matt Stevens President Trump may not be debating Joseph R. Biden Jr. on the same stage on Thursday night as originally planned. But the two candidates will still face off head-to-head. NBC said on Wednesday that it would broadcast a televised town hall with Mr. Trump from Miami on Thursday at 8 p.m. Eastern — the exact time that Mr. Biden will appear on ABC for his own town-hall-style event in Philadelphia. The decision to schedule Mr. Trump directly against Mr. Biden generated a swift backlash on Wednesday among top Democrats and media pundits, who said NBC was allowing the president an opportunity to blot out his opponent on the airwaves. Vivian Schiller, a former news executive at Twitter and National Public Radio who previously worked at NBC, called the timing decision “shameful” in a Twitter post. “The point of a news organization is to serve the public. This is the opposite,” Ms. Schiller wrote. Mr. Biden’s town hall has been on the books since last week, after Mr. Trump, who had recently contracted the coronavirus, rejected plans to convert the second formal presidential debate into a virtual matchup; the debate was eventually canceled. Officials at NBC said the 8 p.m. timing for Mr. Trump’s event was, in fact, about parity: NBC hosted a town hall with Mr. Biden on Oct. 5 that aired during the 8 p.m. hour, and the network wanted to retain the same conditions for the president’s event. ABC’s announcement that Mr. Biden would appear on its air prompted Mr. Trump’s campaign to seek its own rival telecast, leading to a lengthy negotiation with NBC officials who wanted independent proof that the president would not pose a safety risk to other participants — including network crew members, the Florida voters on hand to ask questions, and the moderator, Savannah Guthrie of the “Today” show. The NBC event, to be moderated by the “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie, had been contingent on the Trump campaign providing independent proof that the president would not pose a safety risk to the other participants — including NBC crew members, voters and Ms. Guthrie herself. On Wednesday’s “Today” show, the NBC anchor Craig Melvin said the town hall would occur “in accordance with the guidelines set forth by health officials” and proffered a statement from Clifford Lane, a clinical director at the National Institutes of Health. In the statement, Dr. Lane said he had reviewed medical data about Mr. Trump’s condition, including a so-called P.C.R. test — a widely used diagnostic test for the coronavirus that is considered more reliable than a rapid antigen test — that the N.I.H. “collected and analyzed” on Tuesday. Dr. Lane concluded “with a high degree of confidence” that the president is “not shedding infectious virus,” NBC said. The town hall on Thursday will be held outdoors at the Pérez Art Museum in Miami, and audience members will be required to wear face masks, the network said. Ms. Guthrie and Mr. Trump will be seated at least 12 feet apart. — Michael M. Grynbaum Senator Lindsey Graham, who is fighting off an increasingly steep re-election challenge in South Carolina, drew criticism on Wednesday after he invoked the “good old days of segregation” at the confirmation hearing of Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Asking the judge about various Supreme Court precedents as he opened the third day of hearings, Mr. Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, appeared to be trying to drive home the point that there was no longer any meaningful push in America to challenge the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, which held that school segregation was unconstitutional. “One of the reasons you can say with confidence that you think Brown v. Board of Education is a super precedent is you are not aware of any effort to go back to the good old days of segregation via legislative body. Is that correct?” he asked. Judge Barrett answered in the affirmative. Mr. Graham later said that he was being sarcastic when he used the expression, but for the second time in a week he found himself on the defensive for remarks about race. Mr. Graham, who has evolved into one of President Trump’s biggest allies from one of his toughest critics, and who reversed himself on the propriety of trying to confirm a Supreme Court justice in an election year now that doing so benefits Republicans, has been tied in recent polls of the state. His comment drew a swift rebuke from his Democratic rival, Jaime Harrison, who shared a clip of Mr. Graham’s remark on his Twitter account, sending it bouncing across social media. “The good old days for who, Senator?” asked Mr. Harrison, who is Black. “It’s 2020, not 1920. Act like it.” .@LindseyGrahamSC just called segregation “the good old days.” The good old days for who, Senator?

It’s 2020, not 1920. Act like it. pic.twitter.com/qVhhfp7oRY During a break in the hearing, Mr. Graham said he had been misunderstood and rebuked his opponent for the criticism. His comments were “dripping with sarcasm,” Mr. Graham said, referring to the era of segregation as “dark days.” “It blows my mind that any rational person could believe that about me,” he added. The comment came just a few days after Mr. Graham was roundly criticized for saying during a campaign forum in South Carolina that Black people “can go anywhere in this state” as long as they were “conservative, not liberal.” He had been talking about his friendship with the state’s other Republican senator, Tim Scott, who is a Black man. — Nicholas Fandos Former President Barack Obama plans to hit the road on behalf of his former vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., over the next two weeks for socially-distanced appearances in battleground states to encourage Democrats during early voting, according to people familiar with his plans. Aides to the former president would not say where or when Mr. Obama plans to travel but a person familiar with the planning said his team had discussed possible visits to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin or Florida with Mr. Biden’s team. It is not clear if Michelle Obama, the former first lady and a figure whose popularity rivals her husband’s, will also make in-person appearances. Aides to Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden would not respond to specific questions about his schedule and said an announcement would be forthcoming when the arrangements had been finalized. Mr. Obama’s endgame re-engagement, a reprise of his efforts on behalf of Hillary Clinton four years ago, kicks off this afternoon when he sits down with two former White House advisers, Jon Favreau and Tommy Vietor, who host the popular Pod Save America podcast. The podcast episode, due to run 30 minutes, will be taped at 4 p.m. and posted Wednesday evening; interview topics will include “his thoughts on the race, his pitch to voters, his thoughts on the future of Trumpism and democracy,” Mr. Favreau said. Mr. Obama, who adopted a posture of neutrality during the Democratic primaries, expressed initial reluctance to take on President Trump personally — to deprive him of an easy foil that could motivate the president’s base. But he cast aside caution over the summer and fall, appearing at fund-raisers, roundtables and side-by-sides with Mr. Biden and campaign surrogates over Zoom. Mr. Obama’s address to the Democratic convention in August painted a dire picture of the country under Mr. Trump, portraying him as a man unfit, uncaring and unserious, who threatens both the nation’s welfare and its core democratic institutions. “This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that’s what it takes to win,” Mr. Obama, hair grayed and manner grave, said in one of the most comprehensive denunciations of a sitting president made by a predecessor. — Glenn Thrush TRANSCRIPT “We’ll make sure that all of these emails get to the right place, and we will do everything we can to make sure that the American people get a chance to see as much as we can equitably produce.” Reporter: “If you look at the chronology of public statements surrounding this development, it would appear that this action was taken by you in response to public, pleas from the president. You’ve been secretary of state for two and a half years or so. You’ve had ample time to meet the imperatives of transparency and doing so within three weeks of an election, obviously will strike even fair-minded observers as political in nature.” “I actually have been involved in these emails for a long time. You’ll recall I previously served as a member of Congress, where Secretary Clinton’s use of personal server containing classified information became a very important issue. I think that’s really important for the American people to continue to understand — this isn’t that there was a stray comment on her personal server. This was a system designed to evade State Department rules and regulations on which, on that server, ended up containing highly classified information — that’s important. Second, with respect to our transparency, it’s an ongoing process. We’ve had people out for Covid. We have lots of challenges and production of documents — today, you can go to the State Department’s website and see 35,000-plus emails that came from Secretary Clinton’s server that were provided in response to various inquiries. We’ve provided documents to Capitol Hill all throughout my time in two and half years. And we’re going to continue to do the work as we identify material. We look at it and review it. We’ll make sure we make the right decisions for the American people and transparency.” Under intense pressure from President Trump, who is behind in the polls and seeking a rerun of the help his campaign got from late discussion of Hillary Clinton’s emails in 2016, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that Americans had a right to “transparency” — but did not commit to releasing any more of the emails ahead of the Nov. 3 election. Mr. Pompeo’s comments to journalists on Wednesday appeared to be an attempt to placate his boss and fuel political outrage against Mrs. Clinton, even as he said that the State Department had already released more than 35,000 documents from her personal server. “We’re going to continue to do the work,” Mr. Pompeo said. “As we identify material, we’ll look at it and review; we’ll make sure we make the right decisions for the American people, in transparency.” He refused to say how many more emails have yet to be released from a cache that Mrs. Clinton, who served as secretary of state under President Barack Obama, turned over to investigators as she campaigned for president against Mr. Trump in 2016. Instead, Mr. Pompeo noted that “35,000-plus emails that came from Secretary Clinton’s server that were provided in response to various inquiries” were posted on the State Department’s website. Mr. Pompeo also said that the department has continued to release documents since he took over in 2018; the last batch appears to have been posted on the department’s website in May 2019. Last year, State Department investigators concluded that while she was secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton had risked compromising classified information by using a private email server for official business. But they found that she did not deliberately or systematically do so. Mrs. Clinton had largely disappeared from public life since 2016. But Mr. Trump, who is trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr. in polls and is seeking to whip up supporters in the homestretch of the campaign, has been reminding voters of the email debacle and lashing out at Mr. Pompeo for not releasing all the documents. “They’re in the State Department, but Mike Pompeo has been unable to get them out, which is very sad,” the president said last week. “Actually, I’m not happy about him for that — that reason. He was unable to get them out. I don’t know why. You’re running the State Department, you get them out. Forget about the fact that they were classified. Let’s go. Maybe Mike Pompeo finally finds them.” Mr. Pompeo initially said he would “get the information out that needs to get out.” But his remarks on Wednesday left it unclear when any release might happen. He cited delays in producing additional documents because of the coronavirus and other “challenges.” He also dismissed as “ridiculous” a question about whether releasing more of Mrs. Clinton’s emails at Mr. Trump’s demand would violate the Hatch Act, which bars political activity at the federal workplace. — Lara Jakes A federal judge has extended the voter registration deadline in Virginia until 11:59 p.m. on Thursday, after a cut cable on Tuesday brought down the online system hours before the original deadline. Judge John A. Gibney Jr. granted the extension on Wednesday after voting rights groups argued that the six-hour outage had disenfranchised voters during a critical day when voters, who often wait to the last minute, rushed to apply in time to vote in November. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law filed a lawsuit late Tuesday night requesting that the deadline be extended and calling for the state make “a significant effort” to tell the public about the change. “If you still need to register or update your information, you can do it online at https://vote.virginia.gov—you can also register and vote early at your registrar’s office,” Gov. Ralph Northam wrote in a tweet announcing the decision. “The systemwide failure impacted Virginians across the Commonwealth, preventing people from registering to vote for the first time or updating their registrations, and prevented many voters from casting a regular ballot during in-person early voting,” said Tram Nguyen, co-executive director of New Virginia Majority, a progressive group that backed extending the deadline.   Around midday on Tuesday, Virginia’s Department of Elections reported a “fiber cut” that took down the networks of several agencies in Richmond, including the department’s registration portal. The cable was inadvertently cut during roadside utilities work near Richmond, according to the state’s information technology agency, and no foul play is suspected.  The connection to the portal was restored six hours later. — Glenn Thrush President Trump traveled on Tuesday to Johnstown, Pa. — exactly the kind of place where he needs to run up the score next month — and, even with a teleprompter in tow, he veered off script to instead deliver some stage directions for the electorate. “Suburban women, will you please like me?” Mr. Trump said at his rally. “Please. Please. I saved your damn neighborhood, OK?” The itinerary of Mr. Trump’s return to the campaign trail after his multiday hospitalization with the coronavirus this month shows the extent to which the president has been forced into a defensive posture in the final weeks of the campaign. He is pleading directly with women who have abandoned him in large numbers, and on Friday he will make stops in Florida, a must-win battleground, and Georgia, a longtime Republican stronghold now firmly up for grabs. And for a second straight day, Mr. Trump joked about wading down into the crowd from the stage to kiss people, since he says he has recovered from the virus. “Now I’m immune,” he crowed. Later, Mr. Trump spent part of his evening amplifying a false conspiracy theory about the Central Intelligence Agency, President Barack Obama and the terrorist Osama bin Laden. His Democratic challenger, Joseph R. Biden Jr., spent the day in Florida, and delivered his remarks while wearing a mask. Mr. Trump’s campaign put out a rare set of “prepared” excerpts in advance of his rally on Tuesday, with messaging that mostly reprised his 2016 come-from-behind approach, calling Mr. Biden a “a servant of the radical globalists” and casting himself as an agitator who would not “play by the rules” of Washington. As Mr. Trump appealed to women, Mr. Biden sought to bolster his growing strength with older voters, a large, typically Republican bloc that has moved away from the president. “The only senior that Donald Trump cares about — the only senior — is senior Donald Trump,” Mr. Biden said at a community center in Pembroke Pines, Fla., near Fort Lauderdale. He pitched himself to senior citizens by invoking what many care about most: their grandchildren. Accusing Mr. Trump of throwing “super-spreader parties at the White House,” he said older voters had been forced into separation from their families for their own safety. “How many of you have been unable to hug your grandkids in the last seven months?” Mr. Biden said. Shortly after his rally had wrapped, Mr. Trump, 74, posted a meme to his Twitter account mocking Mr. Biden, 77, as elderly. Last week, he had recorded a video on the White House grounds praising seniors as his “favorite people in the world.” pic.twitter.com/wJN4zv0y8O Representative Brendan Boyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania, responded to Mr. Trump’s tweet with a thinking-face emoji. “I just can’t quite figure out why @JoeBiden is the first Democrat in decades to be winning the senior vote??!!” he wrote. — Shane Goldmacher As a student at Howard University, called “The Mecca” by those who know its legacy, Kamala Harris settled into the pragmatic politics that have defined her career. She participated in protests, but was a step removed from the more extreme voices on campus. She sparred with the Black Republicans on the debate team but made no secret that she thought some tactics by activists on the left were going too far. She extolled the values of racial representation, joining a generation of Black students who decided to step into the institutions — in government and the corporate world — that were unavailable to their parents. In interviews, more than a dozen classmates and friends who knew Ms. Harris and attended Howard themselves placed their experience in the larger context of Black politics in the 1980s and a changing Washington. They were the children of the civil rights movement, the early beneficiaries of federal school desegregation, with newfound access to institutions and careers. Words like mass incarceration and systemic racism were not yet widely used, though the effects of both were becoming visible around Howard’s campus. Instead, there was an overarching belief among them that increased racial representation could bend any institution to their will, that participating in a system many viewed as unjust was an important form of harm reduction. Ms. Harris has personally cited this belief in years since, including when she discusses her decision to become a prosecutor. More than 30 years later, the power and limitations of Ms. Harris’s instinct to couple insider politics with her lens as a Black woman and first-generation American are on display as Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s running mate. On the vice-presidential debate stage last week, Vice President Mike Pence criticized her record as prosecutor, arguing that it disproportionately affected people of color. “I will not sit here and be lectured by the vice president on what it means to enforce the laws of our country,” Ms. Harris responded, a response that is also a callback to a worldview that she formed in college. That’s when she and her classmates weighed what to do in the world and decided a system that had historically oppressed Black Americans could be made to work in their favor. Ms. Harris, who declined to be interviewed about her college years, said through a campaign spokeswoman that she was proud to be back at Howard — occasionally working from an office on campus during the campaign — and that the college was “a place that shaped her.” — Astead W. Herndon Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign on Wednesday introduced a new ad featuring Bridgett Floyd, one of George Floyd’s sisters, who in an emotional testimonial calls the former vice president “the change we need.” Set against a soft piano score, Ms. Floyd recalls Mr. Biden’s personal outreach after the killing of Mr. Floyd by the Minneapolis police, set against pictures of Mr. Biden praying, reflecting and interacting with Black voters on the campaign trail. “He was actually there to listen,” Ms. Floyd says in the ad. “He was very sincere.” The ad, released on what would have been Mr. Floyd’s 47th birthday, comes as the Biden campaign is ramping up its effort to energize Black voters as early voting gets underway. Though the ad will air nationally on television, digital platforms and radio, the Biden campaign plans to target it in 16 different states as well. The ad is being accompanied by a day of action to honor Mr. Floyd on his birthday, organized by the George Floyd Memorial Foundation, which was founded by members of his family. The social media campaign asks people to ensure that they “make a voting plan now” and to call their senators to pass a criminal justice overhaul bill. The foundation also announced a partnership with the National Urban League to get out the vote. “He should still be here today,” Ms. Floyd said in a statement. “For that reason, I greatly believe that we need change, and it’s pivotal that people vote in this election. People need to make a plan and take voting seriously — it’s more important than ever.” — Nick Corasaniti It is one of the most enduring questions of President Trump’s appeal: Who are the nearly 30 percent of Hispanic voters who say they support him, despite his anti-immigration rhetoric and policies? There is no one simple answer. Mr. Trump has strong backing from Cuban and Venezuelan exiles in South Florida, who like his stance against communism. And his campaign has heavily courted evangelical Latinos throughout the country. But no other group worries Democrats more than American-born Hispanic men, particularly those under the age 45, who polls show are highly skeptical of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Men are the core of President Trump’s base. In polling, gender gaps exist in nearly every demographic: among white voters, among senior citizens, among voters without a college degree, men are far more likely than women to support his re-election. Polls suggest that this election could result in the largest gender gap since the passage of the 19th Amendment a century ago. Yet what has alienated so many older, female and suburban voters is a key part of Mr. Trump’s appeal to many of these men, interviews with dozens of Mexican-American men supporting Mr. Trump shows: To them, the macho allure of Mr. Trump is undeniable. He is forceful, wealthy and, most important, unapologetic. In a world where at any moment someone might be attacked for saying the wrong thing, he says the wrong thing all the time and does not bother with self-flagellation. Paul Ollarsaba Jr., a 41-year-old Marine veteran, voted for a Republican for the first time in 2016, won over by what he saw as Mr. Trump’s commitment to the military. “I am Mexican,” Mr. Ollarsaba said, adding that for years he thought that meant he had to vote for Democrats. When he began supporting Mr. Trump in 2016, his family ostracized him. “My parents say: ‘Why are you supporting a racist? You’re Mexican, you have to vote this way,’” he said. “No, it’s my country. It’s fear, people are afraid of saying they support the president.” Though Hispanic women overwhelmingly support Mr. Biden, Hispanic men appear to have a persistent discomfort, with polls showing him struggling to maintain more than 60 percent of the group, far below his average among nonwhite voters. Mr. Biden has not done enough to directly reach out to these young Latino men, Republican and Democratic strategists say. “You have these U.S.-born Hispanic males under 40 who are pretty Trumpy, the question is why?” said Mike Madrid, a Republican consultant involved with the Lincoln Project, which is working to get Mr. Trump out of the White House. — Jennifer Medina AD WATCH With less than three weeks to go before Nov. 3, it’s the time of year for closing messages. And for candidates with virtually unlimited money, that means highly-produced 60-second TV ads voiced by high-profile surrogates that intend to leave the viewer optimistic and perhaps a bit emotional not just about voting but about America and, maybe, even life itself. These two ads, from the Democratic Senate candidates Jaime Harrison in South Carolina and Mark Kelly in Arizona, don’t bother to mention the incumbent Republicans each man is trying to defeat. They don’t have to, because by this point in the campaign, voters in each state have been bombarded by tens of millions of dollars of advertising eviscerating Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Martha McSally of Arizona. Instead, Mr. Harrison and Mr. Kelly are, in the closing weeks of the campaign, pitching voters on a broader idea. For Mr. Harrison, it’s a belief, voiced by the South Carolina-born actress Viola Davis, that a Democrat can win in what has been a solidly Republican state for a generation. Mr. Kelly’s ad, voiced by his wife, the former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, is her testimonial to his fidelity and loyalty — to her, to the country and, if elected, to Arizona. It almost doesn’t matter what’s in the ad; just hearing Ms. Giffords’s voice, still shaky nine years after she was shot in the head outside a Tucson supermarket, is a moving tribute to his candidacy. Neither ad touches on any policy stance or political statement. Their aim is simply to tug at heartstrings without offering a political rationale. It’s the television version of the phrase: “If you know, you know.” Mr. Harrison’s and Mr. Kelly’s ads are airing in their respective states. These ads are the luxury of a campaign so flush with cash that it can afford a minute-long interruption to the onslaught of vituperative TV spots in battleground states. They bring to mind the classic 2016 Bernie Sanders ad with no words, set to the Simon and Garfunkel song “America,” and represent the campaign’s final efforts to define themselves. For Mr. Harrison, that means inspiring hope that he can actually win. For Mr. Kelly, it’s pitching the idea that the famously prickly former astronaut is actually a nice guy. — Reid J. Epstein The unlikely transformation of Joseph R. Biden Jr., a 77-year-old whose seemingly limited appeal to small donors left him financially outflanked in the primaries, into perhaps the greatest magnet for online money in American political history is a testament to the ferocity of Democratic opposition to President Trump. Mr. Biden now has a once-unimaginable cash edge over Mr. Trump, and since Sept. 1 he has reserved about $140 million more in television advertising than the president. Money alone does not determine presidential winners — Hillary Clinton vastly outspent Mr. Trump in 2016 — but the cash has provided Mr. Biden enviable flexibility to engineer the electoral map to his advantage. “There was always going to be a large amount of money coming into the nominee,” said Michael Whitney, a Democratic digital fund-raising specialist who worked for Senator Bernie Sanders in the primary. “I’m sure they never dreamed it would be this big.” To chart Mr. Biden’s consequential financial turnabout, The New York Times analyzed the flow of nearly 11 million online contributions from the first nearly 500 days of his campaign. The analysis looked at $436 million given through August to Mr. Biden and his shared committee with the Democratic National Committee via ActBlue, the donation-processing platform. Checks, merchandise sales and other offline giving were not included. The Times analysis shows four inflection points in Mr. Biden’s fund-raising metamorphosis, beginning with one unwittingly provided last fall by Mr. Trump, whose presidency has been rocket fuel for Democratic fund-raising. The other three points — all linked in different ways to race — emerge from the 2020 data: Mr. Biden’s sweeping victories delivered by Black voters in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, the protests following the police killing of George Floyd and, especially, the selection of Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. — Shane Goldmacher and Rachel Shorey A large majority of Indian-Americans plan to cast ballots for the Democratic ticket of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Kamala Harris, according to a survey released Wednesday, despite elaborate overtures by the Trump White House to win their support. The survey, by the polling firm YouGov, found that 72 percent of Indian-American voters planned to vote for Mr. Biden, with just 22 percent planning to go for President Trump. While Indian-Americans hold a wide variety of political views, the presence on the Democratic ticket of Ms. Harris, whose mother immigrated from Chennai, India, has had a galvanizing effect on a voting bloc that could help Mr. Biden in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Florida and Michigan. Their potential impact on the presidential election highlights the growing importance of Indian-Americans in U.S. politics: As the second-largest immigrant group in the country, Indian-Americans are gaining influence, making political donations, vocally supporting candidates and causes and, most notably, running for office, from the school board to Congress. “We have arrived,” said Ramesh Kapur, a Democratic Party fund-raiser. Ms. Harris isn’t the only reason many Indian-Americans support the Democratic ticket this year, Mr. Kapur said. They are also turned off by the president’s frequent attacks on immigrants and people of color, despite standing to gain from Mr. Trump’s economic policies. “Even though they are supposedly saving taxes, to the Indian-American community, when you get the president of the United States saying to an elected official, ‘Go home,’ that scares the hell out of us,” he said, referring to Mr. Trump’s tweet in July 2019 about a group of four minority congresswomen. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
