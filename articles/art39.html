Trump jokes about needing ‘a couple more terms.’ ‘12 more years,’ the crowd chants. Concerns grow at the Pentagon that Trump will pull the military into the election. Legal battles over voting rules may be a preview of postelection fights. Other nations are stunned by America’s trouble with the virus, and Trump’s refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power. New ad attacks Senator Tillis for his support to fill Supreme Court vacancy. A complete guide to how to vote, by mail or in person, early or on Election Day. President Trump told an audience in Atlanta Friday that “you can’t joke” as president and complained that when he jests about serving more than two terms he is accused of being “a dictator” who won’t cede power, which prompted his audience to chant “12 more years!” Speaking at an event focused on Black economic empowerment, Mr. Trump joked that he could deliver more benefits “if only we had a couple more terms.” Then he warned that he was sure to be criticized for the remark. “There’s your breaking news,” he said, before mimicking the response of a self-serious news commentator: “I told you, he’s a dictator!” he said. “He will not give up power! Under no circumstances will he give up power. He intends to serve at least two more terms.” “Oh, that’s a big story,” Mr. Trump added, suggesting that his use of sarcasm is often misunderstood. “You know, you can’t joke.” Mr. Trump has made similar comments in the past, but they seemed particularly significant in a week where he refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of political power and cast doubts  on the November election result. After Mr. Trump said that reporters would accuse him of wanting “12 more years” in office, the audience began a chant of “12 more years!” After letting them continue a few times, Mr. Trump thanked them and quickly resumed his remarks. Earlier Friday, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, belittled the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for telling Congress that there was no evidence of the kind of widespread voter fraud the president has repeatedly warned of. The F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, had testified to Congress on Thursday that the bureau had seen no evidence of coordinated fraud, undercutting Mr. Trump’s constant, baseless claims that the election would not be “honest” or that mail-in ballots were a “scam.” Mr. Meadows struck back Friday on “CBS This Morning.” “With all due respect to Director Wray, he has a hard time finding emails in his own F.B.I., let alone figuring out whether there’s any kind of voter fraud,” Mr. Meadows said, possibly referring to anti-Trump texts between F.B.I. officials on the team of the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, which the F.B.I. has said were not preserved, angering Republicans. The extraordinary scene of the White House chief of staff denigrating one of the nation’s top law enforcement officials was the latest sign of how the president’s refusal to commit to honoring the results of the presidential election has rattled Washington. On Thursday, prominent Republicans reaffirmed their commitment to the orderly transfer of power, but took pains to avoid criticizing the president. Democrats cast Mr. Trump as a threat to democracy who sought to undermine confidence in the election and suppress the vote. And the White House attempted to send reassuring signals, only for Mr. Trump, who has trailed steadily in polls, to double down and repeat baseless assertions that the vote would be a “big scam.” Chris Edelson, an American University professor who has studied the expansion of presidential power during emergencies, said there were “really no precedents” for Mr. Trump’s comments. “It’s impossible to underscore how absolutely extraordinary this situation is,” he said. Asked about Mr. Trump’s reluctance to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, Mr. Meadows said the president would do so “as long as it’s a fair election,” echoing comments made Thursday by the White House press secretary. — Michael Crowley and Michael Cooper Senior Pentagon leaders have a lot to worry about these days — Afghanistan, Russia, Iraq, Syria, Iran, China, Somalia, the Korean Peninsula. But chief among those concerns is whether their commander in chief might order American troops into any chaos around the coming elections. President Trump gave the officials no solace this week as he hedged when asked to commit to a peaceful handoff of the reins of government should he lose the election. Coupled with his expressed desire in June to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act to send troops to quell Black Lives Matter protests, his comments have incited deep anxiety among senior military leaders, who insist they will do all they can to keep the armed forces out of the elections. “I believe deeply in the principle of an apolitical U.S. military,” Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told House lawmakers last month. “In the event of a dispute over some aspect of the elections, by law, U.S. courts and the U.S. Congress are required to resolve any disputes, not the U.S. military. I foresee no role for the U.S. armed forces in this process.” But that has not stopped an intensifying debate in the military about its role should a disputed election lead to civil unrest. Last month, two retired Army officers published an open letter to General Milley on the website Defense One. “In a few months’ time, you may have to choose between defying a lawless president or betraying your constitutional oath,” they wrote. “If Donald Trump refuses to leave office at the expiration of his constitutional term, the United States military must remove him by force, and you must give that order.” Pentagon officials swiftly said such an outcome was preposterous. But senior leaders at the Pentagon, speaking on the condition of anonymity, acknowledged that they were talking among themselves about what to do if Mr. Trump, who will still be president until Inauguration Day no matter what, invokes the Insurrection Act and tries to send troops into the streets. Several Pentagon officials said that such a move could prompt resignations among many of Mr. Trump’s senior generals, starting at the top with General Milley.  — Jennifer Steinhauer and Helene Cooper With less than six weeks until Election Day, laws governing how Americans vote remain in flux in many battleground states, with the two parties fighting over rules and President Trump suggesting he might challenge any unfavorable outcome. The combination of the pandemic and doubts about the capacity of the Postal Service to handle the flood of mail ballots it will bring, along with a push by Democrats to expand access to voting and counter Republican efforts to limit it, has fueled lawsuits and legislative skirmishes that remain unresolved even with early voting underway. The result is uncertainty that Mr. Trump seized on this week to cast doubt on the election,  refusing on Wednesday to commit to a peaceful transfer of power and saying on Thursday that he was not sure the November election could be “honest” because mail-in ballots were “a whole big scam.” In many states, confusion over casting and counting ballots has reached levels rarely before seen. In Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, two pivotal states in the presidential election, legal fights could affect when voters have to mail their ballots. In Pennsylvania and Ohio, there are lawsuits about where voters can drop ballots off. In Michigan, another battleground, pending legislation concerns whether voters will be able to fix problems with mail-in ballots. In North Carolina, after elections officials extended the deadline for receiving mail ballots by six days, Republicans pledged to try to overturn it. “A whole bunch of Americans are going to have a different process than they may be used to,” said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School who oversaw voting rights in the Obama administration as a deputy assistant attorney general.  — Nick Corasaniti and Kenneth P. Vogel BANGKOK — Amid the pandemic and in the run-up to the presidential election, much of the world is watching the United States with a mix of shock, chagrin and, most of all, bafflement. How did a superpower allow itself to be felled by a virus? And after nearly four years during which President Trump has praised authoritarian leaders and obscenely dismissed some other countries as insignificant and crime-ridden, is the United States in danger of exhibiting some of the same traits he has disparaged? “The U.S.A. is a first-world country but it is acting like a third-world country,” said U Aung Thu Nyein, a political analyst in Myanmar. Adding to the sense of bewilderment, Mr. Trump has refused to embrace an indispensable principle of democracy, dodging questions about whether he will commit to a peaceful transition of power after the November election should he lose. His demurral, combined with his frequent attacks on the balloting process, led Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, a Republican, to write on Twitter that the peaceful transition of power is fundamental to democracy. “Without that, there is Belarus,” he wrote. In Belarus, where tens of thousands of people have faced down the police after the widely disputed re-election last month of President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, Mr. Trump’s remarks sounded familiar. “It reminds me of Belarus, when a person cannot admit defeat and looks for any means to prove that he couldn’t lose,” said Kiryl Kalbasnikau, a 29-year-old opposition activist and actor. “This would be a warning sign for any democracy.” The diminution of the United States’ global image began before the pandemic, as Trump administration officials snubbed international accords and embraced an America First policy. Now, though, its reputation seems to be in free-fall. A Pew Research Center poll of 13 countries found that over the past year, nations including Canada, Japan, Australia and Germany have been viewing the United States in its most negative light in years. In every country surveyed, the vast majority of respondents thought the United States was doing a bad job with the pandemic. Such global disapproval historically has applied to countries with less open political systems and strongmen in charge. But people from just the kind of developing countries that Mr. Trump has mocked say the signs coming from the United States are ominous: a disease unchecked, mass protests over racial and social inequality, and a president who seems unwilling to pledge support for the tenets of electoral democracy. And an American passport, which once allowed easy access to almost every country in the world, is no longer a valuable travel pass. Because of the coronavirus, American tourists are banned from most of Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania and Latin America.  — Hannah Beech President Trump has initiated the most aggressive environmental deregulation agenda in modern history, but as his first term drives to a close, many of his policies are being cut down by the courts — even by Republican-appointed jurists who the administration had hoped would be friendly. Those losses have actually heightened the stakes for Mr. Trump in the election and the fight over a replacement on the Supreme Court for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: A second term, coupled with a 6-3 conservative majority on the high court, may be necessary to make some of his biggest environmental rollbacks a reality. Since January courts have dealt a series of blows to the Trump administration’s plans to ramp up fossil fuel development and undo decades of environmental protections. This month, a federal appeals court temporarily blocked implementation of a major rollback of methane emissions standards for the oil and gas industry while it considers permanent action. That followed decisions by judges that have thrown the future of the Dakota Access Pipeline into doubt, struck down the relaxation of protections for migratory birds and vacated the rollback of an Obama-era rule to reduce waste from natural gas flaring on federal lands. Five recent unfavorable rulings came from Republican-appointed judges, including a 6-3 clean water decision in April by the Supreme Court with Justice Ginsburg in the majority. A panel of three judges appointed by Mr. Trump unanimously overturned a policy that would have suspended hefty new penalties for automakers who failed to meet fuel efficiency standards. According to a database kept by New York University’s nonpartisan Institute for Policy Integrity, the Environmental Protection Agency has won only nine out of 47 cases in court under Mr. Trump, while the Interior Department has won four of 22. The Trump administration’s overall win rate hovers just under 16 percent, the group said, compared to win rates of about 70 percent for both the Obama and Bush administrations. But the courts have in most cases given the administration an opportunity to go back and revise their work. The future of those rules may then rest on whether Mr. Trump is re-elected, with a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court ready to hear his fresh attempts.  — Lisa Friedman and John Schwartz A Democratic nonprofit group will spend $2 million over the next two weeks on an ad attacking Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, over his support for quickly filling the vacancy on the Supreme Court after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The ad aligns with a central election issue for Democrats — health care — and argues that a vote for President Trump’s nominee for the court puts the Affordable Care Act at risk, along with protections for pre-existing conditions that are enshrined in the law. Republican senators facing tough re-election fights have taken markedly different tacks on how to handle the vacancy, with huge risks for their campaigns. Susan Collins of Maine, for example, has said that the nomination should wait until after the election, while others, like Mr. Tillis, have embraced the president’s plan. A recent poll from The Washington Post found that 57 percent of voters nationwide think the nomination should be made by the presidential candidate who wins the election in November. Mr. Tillis was one of the first vulnerable Republican senators to take a position on filling the vacancy, announcing within 24 hours of Justice Ginsburg’s death that he supported the president’s efforts to fill the seat before the election. In one of the most tightly contested races in the country, Mr. Tillis is running to hold on to a seat that could decide which party controls the Senate. A recent poll from The New York Times/Siena College found Mr. Tillis trailing his Democratic challenger, Cal Cunningham, by five points. Mr. Trump, however, was effectively tied with Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the state, meaning Mr. Tillis was running a few points behind the president, and likely hoping that support for his Supreme Court choice could help close that gap. The ad is being run by Piedmont Rising, a left-leaning group that spent most of the year focused on health care before announcing earlier this month that it would devote its resources to defeating Mr. Tillis through an affiliated group, Piedmont Rising Action. — Nick Corasaniti Many voting rules have changed this year because of the pandemic, making it harder than usual to figure out how to cast your ballot. So we did the work for you, in hopes of helping make sure your vote is counted. Many rules have changed during the pandemic, so this interactive guide can help you ensure your vote is counted. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg broke one final barrier on Friday, becoming the first woman and the first Jewish American to lie in state in the United States Capitol. The honor, arranged by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and a private ceremony at the Capitol, bring to a close a week of public memorials for Justice Ginsburg, the liberal Supreme Court jurist and trailblazer who died last Friday at 87. Her family plans to hold a private burial next week at Arlington National Cemetery. Like the memorial at the court on Wednesday, the honors Friday at the Capitol were brief and mostly limited to family and a small contingent of lawmakers. Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill Biden, attended Friday’s the ceremony, along with Senator Kamala Harris, Mr. Biden’s running mate. Asked by a reporter if Justice Ginsburg had helped clear a path for her own success, Ms. Harris said “absolutely.” Justice Ginsburg “made America see what leadership looks like,” Ms. Harris said. “She broke so many barriers and I know that she did it intentionally knowing that people like me could follow.” Only about 30 Americans have received the honor of lying in state at the Capitol: presidents, military leaders and members of Congress, all of them men. Rosa Parks, the civil rights icon, is the only other woman granted a similar honor, but as a private citizen, she lay “in honor.” Justice Ginsburg lay in state in the National Statuary Hall on the House side of the Capitol, where Democrats are in control. Many dignitaries have lain in state in the Capitol Rotunda, between the House and Senate, but both chambers must agree and pass special legislation to allow that. On Thursday, President Trump was jeered by protesters as he paid his respects to Justice Ginsburg, standing silently by her coffin at the top of the Supreme Court steps as a vigorous chant of “Vote him out!” erupted on the street below. As Justice Ginsburg’s legacy was celebrated at the Capitol, White House officials and Senate Republicans busied themselves on Friday with preparations of their own to usher in a conservative successor to the Supreme Court with remarkable speed. — Nicholas Fandos A majority of Americans say that the winner of the presidential election should be the one to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, according to a new poll from The Washington Post and ABC News. Justice Ginsburg died last week, putting enormous new pressure on the two presidential candidates and raising the prospect of a contentious Senate confirmation battle waged alongside the campaign. President Trump is preparing to reveal his Supreme Court nominee on Saturday, and Senate Republicans have been preparing to hold lightning-quick confirmation hearings ahead of the election. It was a stark reversal from four years ago, when Republicans refused to consider President Barack Obama’s nominee to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia in an election year, saying a nominee should await the outcome of the election. According to the survey, most Americans are in no rush this year. The poll found that 57 percent of respondents said the appointment should be left to the winner of the November election, while 38 percent said the seat should be filled by President Trump and the current Senate. Responses diverged along partisan lines, with 90 percent of Democrats favoring a nomination after the election, and only 16 percent of Republicans saying the same. Most Independents — 61 percent, according to the poll — favored waiting, as did most women. The survey, which was produced by Langer Research Associates, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. It was conducted by phone from Monday through Thursday among a random sample of 1,008 adults. The results were similar to those of a recent CNN poll, conducted by the research firm SSRS, which found that 59 percent of Americans said the winner of the November election should fill the Supreme Court vacancy. Republicans appear poised to defy that majority — even if it energizes Democratic turnout in the short run by elevating issues like abortion — as long as it means achieving the long-term goal of tilting the court further to the right. — Jacey Fortin Democrats aren’t being very subtle about their feelings toward Matt Lieberman, a Democratic candidate for one of Georgia’s two Senate seats on the ballot in November. The son of Joseph I. Lieberman, the former Connecticut senator and 2000 Democratic nominee for vice president, is resisting calls from just about everyone that he withdraw in deference to the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor of Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church and a fellow Democrat, who leads him in the polls. On Friday, former President Barack Obama endorsed Dr. Warnock, making a rare foray into what is essentially a party primary. His backing comes a day after Stacey Abrams, the de facto head of Georgia Democrats, said, “We need Matt Lieberman to understand he’s not called for this moment.” And The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Thursday quoted Democrats from across the political spectrum urging Mr. Lieberman to quit. The reason Democrats want Mr. Lieberman out is that he is not competing in a traditional party primary. Because Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican, was appointed in December to replace Senator Johnny Isakson, the first round of voting for the final two years of her term is an all-party primary, with 21 names on the Nov. 3 ballot. If no one gets more than 50 percent of the vote — a near certainty with so many candidates — the top two finishers will compete in a January runoff election. Three polls released this week, by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Monmouth University and The New York Times, showed Ms. Loeffler, Representative Doug Collins, a Republican, and Dr. Warnock bunched tightly together, with Mr. Lieberman trailing the pack, but corralling enough support that it is a distinct possibility that Democrats could be locked out of the January runoff. This week is not the first time Georgia Democrats have called for Mr. Lieberman to quit the race. In August, after HuffPost reported that a novel Mr. Lieberman self-published in 2018 included a racist character and tropes, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Georgia asked him to step aside. Mr. Lieberman’s presence on the ticket has also exposed Dr. Warnock’s inability, so far, to build his coalition beyond the roughly 20 percent support he has received in the latest polling. Mr. Lieberman on Thursday tweeted a lengthy defense of his candidacy that argued Dr. Warnock, and the leading Republican candidates, would all be tools of political elites. In an interview Friday, Mr. Lieberman contended there was “almost no chance” of Democrats being locked out of the runoff because of his candidacy. “If I end up running even or stronger to Warnock its probably because something has befallen his campaign that they have not been able to handle, or because my campaign has made headway,” Mr. Lieberman said. “This tremendous fear that everyone has been living under has been hyped up and is the direct consequence of fear-mongering from the party bosses.” He struck a similar tone on Twitter later on Friday. “Congrats on endorsement from 44 who has endorsed every DC-approved senate candidate,” he told Dr. Warnock. “No, you won’t be beholden to the bosses at all….” Dr. Warnock has a decided financial advantage over Mr. Lieberman. The Warnock campaign has spent $7.9 million on television advertising, compared to just $134,000 for Mr. Lieberman, according to Advertising Analytics. But the Republicans running also have a vast disparity in TV spending while Ms. Loeffler ($16.6 million) and Mr. Collins ($1.2 million) remain neck-and-neck in the polls. — Reid J. Epstein AD WATCH Is it a trailer for an action movie? A Hollywood thriller? At first glance, the four-minute clip resembles an ad for a big-budget film, featuring the dramatic music and special effects — sky-diving! some sort of scanning technology emitted from a character’s eye! — that typically herald a highly-anticipated movie release. It is  in fact a destined-for-virality six-candidate campaign ad, released on Thursday by Texas Reloaded, a joint fund-raising Republican committee for House races in Texas. It’s 5 a.m. in the “Crenshaw Command Center,” and Representative Dan Crenshaw of Houston, a former Navy SEAL, tears open an envelope marked “TOP SECRET.” Inside is a phone. Mr. Crenshaw, who wears an eye patch because of an injury he suffered in Afghanistan, lifts his patch and emits a laser to decipher the phone’s instructions. “Your mission, should you choose to accept it, will be to save Texas,” says a woman’s vaguely robotic, vaguely British voice. “To do so, you must recruit an exceptional team of congressional candidates. They must be courageous, patriotic and absolutely fearless. Time is of the essence. The nation’s future is dependent on your success.” Mr. Crenshaw, now in a plane, leaps into the sky as his first “target” appears: Wesley Hunt, a Republican candidate in a district next door and West Point graduate, whom Mr. Crenshaw finds in the cockpit of a helicopter. “I’m putting a team together, Wesley, you in?” Mr. Crenshaw asks. The two men form a trio with August Pfluger, who is running in the west-central 11th District, and recruit three others: Beth Van Duyne, a former mayor who is running in the Dallas suburbs; Tony Gonzales, a Navy veteran running in a district along the Mexican border; and Genevieve Collins, also running in a suburban-Dallas district, whose credentials flashed onscreen include “athlete.” “TEAM ASSEMBLED. AWAITING NEXT OBJECTIVE” scrolls across the screen. A final shot of the candidates walking together as a fiery explosion erupts behind them closes out the ad. The ad is unequivocally intended to energize Republicans in Texas. Though the ad is somewhat hyperbolic — the nation’s future might not literally depend on Mr. Crenshaw’s ability to recruit Republican congressional candidates — the urgency it suggests is not off base. Texas this year features a number of competitive House races, and Democrats are optimistic that the state could eventually flip from red to blue. Of the six races referenced in the ad, five, including Mr. Crenshaw’s, are ranked by the Cook Political Report as competitive. “We are relying almost exclusively on organic reach on social media,” said Justin Discigil, a spokesman for the Crenshaw campaign. “We have no plans to put the ad on TV.” The ad seems to address head-on that fact Texas is not as red as it once was. Several of the Democratic candidates in these districts, including Sima Ladjevardian, a lawyer and progressive activist who is challenging Mr. Crenshaw, are thought to have decent shots at winning. Mr. Discigil said in an email that Texas Reloaded has raised more than $215,000 since the ad came out. Asked how much the ad cost to make, he said only, “The ad has already paid for itself many times over.” — Sydney Ember DAILY SCHEDULES Here are the daily schedules of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates for Friday, Sept. 25. All times are Eastern time. President Trump 11 a.m.: Speaks at a Latinos for Trump event in Doral, Fla. 2:40 p.m.: Speaks about Black economic empowerment in Atlanta. 6:45 p.m.: Speaks at a round table with supporters at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. 9 p.m.: Holds a rally in Newport News, Va. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Morning: Attends a memorial service for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the Capitol. Vice President Mike Pence No events scheduled. Senator Kamala Harris Morning: Attends a memorial service for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the Capitol. Afternoon: Speaks at a virtual convention of the N.A.A.C.P. Speaking to an African-American audience in Atlanta, President Trump attacked the Black Lives Matter movement as “an organization whose ideology and tactics are right now destroying many Black lives” and attacked his Democratic rival, Joseph. R Biden, Jr., as an enemy of the Black community. “It’s really hurting the Black community,” Mr. Trump said of Black Lives Matter, as his audience booed the mention of its name. “Those pushing to defund the police are hurting Black communities the most.” Speaking at what his campaign called a “Black economic empowerment” event, Mr. Trump promised African-Americans vast economic gains in a second Trump term through what he called a “Platinum Plan,” but offered few policy details and had little of substance to say about the national debate around institutional racism. The Platinum Plan released by the Trump campaign on Friday mostly offered vague goals and pledges, including promises to increase lending to Black businesses and entrepreneurs and to promote “accountable models of policing, including diversity training and accreditation standards.” The plan also vows to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan and Antifa “as terrorist organizations and make lynching a national hate crime.” It is unclear why Antifa, a vaguely defined movement with no record of racism, was included in the plan. The plan also pledges support for making Juneteenth a national holiday. Mr. Trump vowed to bring even “greater fairness to the criminal justice system,” boasting of the reform legislation he signed in early 2019 reducing sentences for many nonviolent offenders. “Even my enemies are saying, ‘Thank you for that,’” Mr. Trump said. He said that the measure had rolled back provisions of the 1994 federal crime legislation, which former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., then a senator, helped write. Mr. Trump called the measure the “1994 Biden crime bill.” Mr. Trump was introduced at the event by the former professional football star Herschel Walker, who began his career playing for the New Jersey Generals, the United States Football League team owned by Mr. Trump in the 1980s. “He don’t get all the credit that he deserves for all the things that he’s done in the African-American community,” Mr. Walker said of Mr. Trump. “He keeps God in the house.” — Michael Crowley A crucial stretch of the race is about to start as President Trump’s Supreme Court pick and his first debate with Joe Biden loom.
