In search of 362,236 unreturned ballots, Democrats plan an all-out scavenger hunt in Wisconsin. Biden heads to Warm Springs and Atlanta in a final push to gain an edge over Trump in Georgia. Contrary to Trump’s predictions, Democrats are poised to expand their House majority. As coronavirus cases and hospitalizations rise in Michigan, Trump plans a rally there. Biden shows continued strength in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin polls. Barrett is swiftly sworn in, as Democrats fume. After Barrett’s confirmation, Biden urges Americans to vote to honor Ginsburg. The Justice Department is blocked in its bid to shield Trump from a rape defamation suit. Last hopes for virus relief before the election fade as the Senate adjourns. They’re well-organized, they’re well-funded, and they have a message: Return your absentee ballot, but don’t use the mail. The Wisconsin Democratic Party and its supporters had been on a mail-voting education crusade since the coronavirus pandemic hit in March, advising people how to request, fill out and return absentee ballots. Now, in the wake of a Supreme Court decision Monday disqualifying absentee ballots that are received by election officials after Election Day, the party is imploring voters to return ballots to their election clerk’s office or use drop boxes, rather than putting them in the mail at this late stage. “We’re phone banking. We’re text banking. We’re friend banking. We’re drawing chalk murals, driving sound trucks through neighborhoods & flying banners over Milwaukee. We’re running ads in every conceivable medium,” Ben Wikler, the party’s chairman, tweeted after the Supreme Court decision. The party is in search of missing absentee ballots. Of about 1,706,771 Wisconsin voters who requested absentee ballots, 1,344,535 have returned them. That means 366,236 ballots are still out there. The wayward ballots could make the difference between President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. winning the White House: Though Mr. Biden has maintained a steady polling lead in Wisconsin, Mr. Trump carried the state in 2016 by the razor-thin margin of 22,748 votes. Wisconsin does not report the party affiliation of voters who request absentee ballots. But in states that do report affiliation, nearly two-third of voters who requested ballots this fall have been Democrats, who polls have found to be more concerned about avoiding polling places amid the pandemic than Republicans are. Under the Supreme Court ruling, mailed ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on election night or they will not count. All along, perhaps in anticipation of such a ruling, the party has been advising voters to treat Oct. 20 — not Nov. 3 — as the deadline for voting. Gladys L. Mitchell-Walthour, a professor of public policy at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, believes the effect of the court’s decision may have been reduced by the educational campaigns by Democrats and others, including the Milwaukee Urban League and Alpha Kappa Alpha, the sorority of Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee. “These efforts may lessen the blow of the Supreme Court ruling,” she said. Even so, Barry C. Burden, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the number of otherwise legitimate votes that will not be counted as a result of the ruling was difficult to predict. “We don’t know what the number will be, but it won’t be zero,” he said. Wisconsin Democrats have tapped into celebrity connections both to raise money and to promote voter education, including an event hosted last month by the cast of “Parks and Recreation.” The party has also enlisted Lady Gaga, who has been promoting drop-box voting, for a Halloween fundraiser. — Stephanie Saul With just a week until Election Day, Joseph R. Biden Jr. will is shifting his focus on Tuesday to Georgia, in a sign of the increasingly competitive nature of a historically red state that is now a battleground. Mr. Biden will speak in Warm Springs, Ga., in the afternoon, before heading to Atlanta for a drive-in rally. Warm Springs has been a timeworn stop for presidential candidates seeking to honor Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had hoped its therapeutic waters would help him recover after polio left him paralyzed. That Mr. Biden is traveling to Georgia at all, let alone in the final stretch of the presidential campaign, suggests that his campaign is expanding its electoral map with just eight days left in the race. Recent polls show Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump, who won Georgia by five points in 2016, locked in a virtual tie. At the same time, two Democratic candidates, Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock, are in tight races for the state’s two Senate seats. Some Democrats are even optimistic about the party’s chances of taking the State House. Georgia, like several other battlegrounds, is shading more purple as its electorate becomes more diverse, with young voters, suburban women and people of color driving the political change. In 2018, Stacey Abrams, a Democrat, only narrowly lost her bid to become the nation’s first Black female governor. Mr. Biden has also announced travel this week to Iowa, Florida, Michigan and Wisconsin. Speaking to reporters during a campaign stop in Chester, Pa., on Monday, Mr. Biden said he was “ not overconfident about anything.” “I just want to make sure we can earn every vote possible,” he said. — Katie Glueck and Sydney Ember Pushing further into Republican territory one week before Election Day, Democrats are poised to expand their majority in the House while Republicans, weighed down by President Trump’s low standing in crucial battlegrounds, are scrambling to offset losses. Bolstered by an enormous cash advantage, a series of critical Republican recruitment failures and a wave of liberal enthusiasm, Democrats have fortified their grip on hard-fought seats won in 2018 that allowed them to seize control of the House. They have trained their firepower and huge campaign coffers on once-solid Republican footholds in affluent suburban districts where voters have become disillusioned with Mr. Trump. That has left Republicans, who started the cycle hoping to retake the House by clawing back a number of the competitive districts they lost in 2018, straining to meet a bleaker goal: limiting the reach of another Democratic sweep by winning largely rural, white working-class districts where Mr. Trump is still popular. Democrats currently outnumber Republicans in the House 232 to 197. Depending on how successful those efforts are, Republican strategists, citing a national environment that has turned against them, privately forecast losing anywhere between a handful of seats to as many as 20. That is starkly at odds with Mr. Trump’s own prediction just days ago that Republicans would win back control of the House, which Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared “delusional,” echoing the private assessments of many in the president’s own party. “The Democrats’ green wave in 2018 has turned into a green tsunami in 2020, which combined with ongoing struggles with college-educated suburban voters, makes for an extremely challenging environment,” said Corry Bliss, a Republican strategist who helped lead the party’s failed 2018 effort to protect its House majority, referring to the torrent of Democratic campaign cash. “There are about a dozen 50-50 races across the country, and the most important factor in each is if the president can close strong in the final stretch.” The terrain for House Republicans was not supposed to be this grim. But Mr. Trump’s stumbling response to the pandemic and inflammatory politics have alienated critical segments of the electorate, particularly suburban voters and women, dragging down congressional Republicans and opening inroads for Democrats in districts that once would have been unfathomable. — Emily Cochrane and Catie Edmondson THE STATE OF THE STATES President Trump is planning to hold a re-election rally in Lansing, Mich., this afternoon, as the state grapples with record high numbers of new coronavirus infections and the continuing fallout of a struggling economy. The state, which Mr. Trump won narrowly in 2016, is key to his re-election hopes, but he has been steadily behind in there in opinion polls. An average of recent Michigan polls put Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s lead at nine percentage points, according to the Upshot’s calculator. Here is how the state is faring on two of the biggest issues of the day, the virus and the economy. In recent days Michigan has begun averaging more than 2,000 new coronavirus cases a day for the first time since the pandemic struck, and the number of hospitalizations there has been steadily climbing, according to a New York Times database. Over the past seven days the state has added 15,569 new cases, the eighth highest tally in the nation, and 187 more people have died, the ninth highest tally. The growing number of hospitalizations is concerning state officials. On Oct. 1 there were 678 patients hospitalized in Michigan, a figure that has nearly doubled since: by Oct. 26 there were 1,332, according to data from the Covid Tracking Project. . The unemployment rate in Michigan stood at 8.5 percent in September, which is above the national average of 7.9 percent, according to data compiled by Moody’s Analytics. And to answer the classic re-election campaign question — are you better off now than you were four years ago? — rate is higher than it was four years ago, when it stood at 5.1 percent. There are seven days until Election Day. Here are the rest of the daily schedules of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates for Tuesday, Oct. 27. All times are Eastern time. President Trump 2 p.m.: Holds a rally in Lansing, Mich. 5 p.m.: Holds a rally in West Salem, Wis. 8:30 p.m.: Holds a rally in Omaha. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Afternoon: Speaks in Warm Springs, Ga. Evening: Holds a drive-in rally in Atlanta. Vice President Pence 12:30 p.m.: Holds a rally in Greensboro, N.C. 3:30 p.m.: Holds a rally in Greenville, S.C. 6:30 p.m. Holds a rally in Wilmington, N.C. Senator Kamala Harris Afternoon: Speaks at a voter mobilization event in Reno, Nev. Evening: Speaks at a voter mobilization event in Las Vegas. — Michael Cooper Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan laid the blame for the alleged kidnapping plot against her firmly at President Trump’s feet on Tuesday, accusing him of  “sowing division and putting leaders, especially women leaders, at risk” with his divisive rhetoric. In an op-ed published in The Atlantic, Ms. Whitmer, a Democrat in her first term, wrote that she was “not surprised” by the scheme and vowed not to “stand back and let the president, or anyone else, put my colleagues and fellow Americans in danger without holding him accountable.” “Every time the president ramps up this violent rhetoric, every time he fires up Twitter to launch another broadside against me, my family and I see a surge of vicious attacks sent our way,” she wrote. “This is no coincidence, and the president knows it. He is sowing division and putting leaders, especially women leaders, at risk. And all because he thinks it will help his re-election.” The F.B.I. said earlier this month that an anti-government group had plotted to kidnap Ms. Whitmer. More than a dozen men accused of involvement in the plot were charged with a variety of state and federal crimes including terrorism, conspiracy and weapons possession. The F.B.I. has said that another Democratic governor, Ralph Northam of Virginia, was also discussed as a possible target. Ms. Whitmer wrote that learning about the plot had been “jarring.” and took particular aim at Mr. Trump’s remarks last week at a rally in Michigan. After he mentioned her name, the crowd began chanting “Lock her up,” to which he responded, “Lock them all up.” In an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes” that aired on Sunday, Mr. Trump denied that he had attacked Ms. Whitmer even though he has repeatedly insulted her, made derisive comments about her leadership and urged his supporters on Twitter to “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” “I haven’t gone after her,” he said. Asked by his interviewer, Lesley Stahl, if he wanted to “lock her up,” he replied: “Of course, I don’t want to lock her up. Why would I lock her up?” Ms. Whitmer and the Michigan attorney general have tied the plot to comments from President Trump and his refusal at times to condemn white supremacists and violent right-wing groups. — Sydney Ember THE UPSHOT There is not much data yet from polls conducted after the final presidential debate, but what there is shows no real sign of movement. With the clock ticking down, that is good news for Joseph R. Biden Jr. and unwelcome news for President Trump. Polls released by Ipsos on Monday found Mr. Biden ahead among likely voters by six points in Pennsylvania and nine points in Wisconsin — both states where Mr. Biden has led consistently and where victory is crucial to his chances of taking the White House.  His margins in the Ipsos polls were both greater than the credibility interval, which is similar to a margin of error.   YouGov surveys of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania also found Mr. Biden maintaining or even building slightly on his leads. Monday also saw the release of national surveys conducted entirely after the debate by  Yahoo/YouGov and Morning Consult, and the president didn’t pick up ground in either. In fact, the YouGov/Yahoo poll showed Joe Biden up by 12, his largest lead yet from that pollster. Beyond that, we have a growing body of polls with at least some interviews done after the debate. There’s the IBD/TIPP tracking poll, which again shows Mr. Biden ticking up a bit over the weekend. And there’s a whole lot of state polling, which all basically looks as it did before the debate. If these kinds of results last into the weekend, President Trump will be in an unenviable spot, needing the polls to be wrong by even more than they were in 2016. — Nate Cohn In America, spikes in firearms purchases are often driven by fear. And now, the nation is on track in 2020 to stockpile at record rates, according to groups that track background checks from F.B.I. data, which showed sales rising earlier this year as virus fears spread. But when it comes to gun ownership, there’s something uniquely American that cuts across party affiliation and social boundaries — leaving liberals and conservatives jostling for ammunition because they want to brace for whatever comes next. “This is a giant room of ‘you never know,’” said Bert Davis, looking around earlier this month at people streaming inside a convention hall in Virginia to peruse weaponry at the Nation’s Gun Show, one of the biggest events of its kind. A human resources worker for the city of Richmond, Va., Mr. Davis had come to the show with his sister Toni Jackson, who had been having difficulty finding 9-millimeter ammunition at local gun shops; they were all sold out. “Everybody is arming themselves against their neighbor,” Ms. Jackson said, looking at the diverse lot of fellow shoppers, some pushing strollers and wheelchairs, one wearing a “Black Lives Matter” mask, one donning a “Keep America Great” mask and people standing in a line for background checks that snaked along the room. “This feeds the separatism of the country.” “What’s going on in the country right now, I’m afraid to be out by myself as a Black woman,” Ms. Jackson said, describing unrest in her city of Richmond and beyond. “There are a lot of people not necessarily excited that Confederate monuments have been taken down.” Other shoppers said they had bought a weapon because they were scared that calls to defund the police would be heeded. Some said they were scared of the police. Some were scared that Joseph R. Biden Jr. would become president. Others were scared of four more years of President Trump. Don Woodson was overseeing the Trojan Arms and Tactical table of dozens of black, pink and Tiffany turquoise semiautomatic handguns. He estimated 70 percent of his sales at the show were to new gun owners, many of whom told him that they are afraid of rioters. “People who never ever would have had guns before,” he said. “Now, they’re looking for security.” — Dionne Searcey and Richard A. Oppel Jr. AD WATCH There are few characteristics more important to President Trump than maintaining an appearance of toughness. The Biden campaign has enlisted the help of Dave Bautista, the 6-foot-6 former professional wrestler turned Hollywood actor, to cut into that narrative in a new ad. Mr. Bautista, clad in a tight gray shirt imprinted with the word “Freedom,” opens the ad with a flex and a yell, then he jumps into describing the difference between “being tough and someone who portrays himself as a tough guy,” as the ad toggles between images of him and Mr. Trump. Mr. Bautista draws a distinction between the president and Joseph R. Biden Jr.: “It’s easy to lie to people; it’s easy to bully people,” he says. “That does not make you a tough guy. It’s easy to tell someone what they want to hear. It’s not easy to tell someone what they need to hear.” As a map shows coronavirus cases increasing across the country, Mr. Bautista says that what America needs is “someone who’s going to have a plan, so we can get back on track.” Scenes of Mr. Biden greeting voters fill the screen. The ad ends with Mr. Bautista circling back to the concept of toughness, praising Mr. Biden as a leader who is “stepping back into this fight for Americans.” The ad makes no verifiable claims. The ad is running on both television markets in Arizona where Mr. Biden holds a slight lead over Mr. Trump, according to polling averages. Professional wrestling is a popular form of entertainment among white men, a constituency among whom Mr. Biden consistently trails Mr. Trump, and a testimonial from one of World Wrestling Entertainment’s legends is clearly aimed at that audience. But the ad also comes as the Biden campaign has been avoiding an emphasis on negative messaging, with 40 percent of its ads wholly positive. The criticism from Mr. Bautista in the beginning, cutting at Mr. Trump’s proud claims of toughness, borrows a bit from previous negative ads from groups like the Lincoln Project that both criticized the president and sought to get under his skin. — Nick Corasaniti TRANSCRIPT [music, “Hail to the Chief”] “In a few moments, we will proudly swear in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. [applause] She is one of our nation’s most brilliant legal scholars, and she will make an outstanding justice on the highest court in our land.” “I will well and faithfully discharge ...” “... the duties of the office on which I’m about to enter ...” “... the duties of the office on which I am about to enter ...” “... so help me God.” “... so help me God.” [applause] “The oath that I have solemnly taken tonight means at its core that I will do my job without any fear or favor, and that I will do so independently of both the political branches and of my own preferences.” “On this vote, the yeas are 52, the nays are 48. The nomination of Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States is confirmed.” [applause] “Since the ink dried on the Constitution, only 114 men and women have been entrusted to uphold the separation of powers, protect people’s rights and dispense impartial justice on the Supreme Court. This is one of the most brilliant, admired and well-qualified nominees in our lifetime.” “I want to be clear with the American people: The Senate majority, this Republican Senate majority, is breaking faith with you, doing the exact opposite of what it promised four years ago, because they wish to cement a majority on the Supreme Court that threatens your fundamental rights. And I want to be very clear with my Republican colleagues: You may win this vote, and Amy Coney Barrett may become the next associate justice of the Supreme Court, but you will never, never get your credibility back.” A divided Senate voted on Monday night to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, capping a lightning-fast Senate approval that handed President Trump a victory days before the election and promised to tip the court to the right for years to come. In a 52-to-48 vote, all but one Republican, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who is battling for re-election, supported now-Justice Barrett, a 48-year-old appeals court judge and protégée of Justice Antonin Scalia. Wasting no time, Mr. Trump held an unusual nighttime swearing-in ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House, a month to the day after a mostly maskless Rose Garden event attended by multiple people who later tested positive for the coronavirus, including Mr. Trump and the first lady. Though more precautions were taken at the ceremony on Monday, masks were not worn by either Mr. Trump or Justice Barrett, both of whom have already had the virus. Justice Clarence Thomas, who swore in his new colleague, wore no mask, either. None of the other seven justices attended. Mr. Trump praised Justice Barrett’s “deep knowledge, tremendous poise and towering intellect,” calling her a suitable replacement for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the liberal stalwart who died last month and was her ideological polar opposite. In her remarks, Justice Barrett seemed intent on sending the message that she would not simply do Mr. Trump’s bidding, using the words “independent” or “independence” three times, even though he has said explicitly that he wanted her seated before the election so she could lend her vote in case of a legal dispute over the balloting. “A judge declares independence not only from the Congress and the president, but also from the private beliefs that might otherwise move her,” Justice Barrett said after being sworn in. “The oath I have solemnly taken tonight,” she added, “means at its core that I will do my job without any fear or favor and that I will do so independently of both the political branches and of my own preferences.” Neither Republicans nor Democrats seemed to believe that, instead commending or condemning her confirmation as a victory for conservatives and a defeat for liberals. Democrats immediately vowed on Monday night that there would be reprisals. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York called on Democrats to expand the court if they won the presidency and took control of the Senate, an idea that the Democratic presidential candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., has so far refused to co-sign. Mr. Biden instead has said that he would set up a bipartisan commission to look at ways to overhaul the court. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, excoriated her Republican colleagues in a fund-raising email to her supporters that was sent minutes after the vote. “They stole another Supreme Court seat just eight days before the end of the election, after tens of millions of Americans had already cast their ballots, and just 15 days before the Supreme Court will hear a case that could overturn the Affordable Care Act,” Ms. Warren wrote. In a statement late Monday, the Biden campaign called the Barrett confirmation “rushed and unprecedented,” and issued a call to action based on the Affordable Care Act case. “If you want to say no, this abuse of power doesn’t represent you — then turn out and vote,” the statement said. Justices can begin work as soon as they are sworn in, meaning Justice Barrett could be at work as early as Tuesday. The court is confronting a host of issues concerning the election and Mr. Trump’s policies, including cases from North Carolina and Pennsylvania about whether deadlines for receiving mailed ballots may be extended. Under the court’s usual practices, Justice Barrett cannot participate in cases that have already been argued, though they could be argued again before the full court if the justices are deadlocked. Next Monday, the court returns to the virtual bench for a two-week sitting to hear arguments by telephone. — Nicholas Fandos, Peter Baker, Neil Vigdor and Adam Liptak Shortly after Justice Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed to the Supreme Court by Republican senators Monday night, Joseph R. Biden Jr. released a statement calling the move “rushed and unprecedented” and imploring Americans to “vote for the legacy of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.” Mr. Biden warned, as he has often done in the days since President Trump picked Judge Barrett to fill Justice Ginsburg’s seat just weeks before Election Day, that her addition to the nation’s highest court could lead to the Affordable Care Act being struck down. “If you want to protect your health care, if you want your voice to be heard in Washington, if you want to say no, this abuse of power doesn’t represent you — then turn out and vote,” Mr. Biden wrote, urging people to cast ballots not just for president but for “Members of Congress, and candidates up and down the ticket who actually have a plan for health care.” “Vote for the legacy of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,” he continued. “She was proof that courage, conviction, and moral clarity can change not just the law, but also the world. Let us continue to be voices for justice in her name.” Mr. Biden ended with a single word, one he repeated six times altogether in the statement: “Vote.” — Sydney Ember A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that President Trump can be personally sued for defamation over a statement he made during his presidency denying a decades-old rape allegation, rejecting a maneuver by the Justice Department that would have likely led to the dismissal of the suit. The ruling by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan allows a lawsuit by the writer E. Jean Carroll to move forward against Mr. Trump, in his capacity as a private citizen, for the time being. Ms. Carroll has accused Mr. Trump of raping her in a department-store dressing room in the 1990s. Her lawsuit claims he harmed her reputation when he denied the attack last year and called her a liar. Last month, the Justice Department intervened on Mr. Trump’s behalf in the suit, which had been filed in state court in New York, citing a law designed to protect federal employees against litigation stemming from the performance of their duties. The Justice Department argued last week that Mr. Trump’s denial was issued in his official capacity as president because it “addressed matters relating to his fitness for office as part of an official White House response to press inquiries.”  And it sought to move Ms. Carroll’s suit to federal court and to substitute the United States for Mr. Trump as the defendant, which would likely lead to the charges being dismissed. But Judge Kaplan ruled that Mr. Trump was not acting in his official capacity when he denied the accusation, writing, “His comments concerned an alleged sexual assault that took place several decades before he took office, and the allegations have no relationship to the official business of the United States.” — Alan Feuer and Benjamin Weiser Politically endangered lawmakers about to face voters often find themselves tempering their instincts, breaking with their parties on tough votes to prove independence and placate constituents, and offering mealy-mouthed platitudes on the most divisive topics of the day. Not Senator Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama, who is facing re-election next week. Considered his party’s most endangered incumbent, he has released TV ads featuring him using stark, stirring language to talk about the death of George Floyd in police custody and has promoted mask wearing. He voted to impeach President Trump and declared on the Senate floor that “Black lives matter.” He has blasted as “shameful” Alabama’s law criminalizing abortion in almost all cases, and suggested raising the age requirement to purchase a gun from 18 to 21. On Monday night, just over a week before Election Day, he joined the rest of his party in voting against Mr. Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Amy Coney Barrett. “These are all things a lot of people felt like wouldn’t be politically expedient for him,” said Chris England, the chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party. “I don’t think that’s necessarily something he concerns himself with.” The odds that voters will return Mr. Jones to Washington and reject his Republican opponent, Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach who has pledged fealty to Mr. Trump, are even more unlikely than those he beat in 2017, when he jolted the political establishment with an unexpected victory over Roy S. Moore, who was accused of sexually assaulting and pursuing teenage girls. But instead of tiptoeing around the Senate as so many politically embattled lawmakers past and present have done, skittering away from reporters when asked about hot-button issues or giving tortured explanations of tricky votes, Mr. Jones has appeared almost liberated by his predicament. In an interview, Mr. Jones insisted that he was posed to beat the odds again in his deeply conservative state. But if he is facing his final curtain in the Senate, he is determined to do it his way. — Catie Edmondson Burgess Owens, a former professional football player running as a Republican in one of the country’s tightest House races, accepted more than $130,000 in contributions that were over the legal limit, raising questions in the final stretch of the election about his compliance with campaign finance laws. Mr. Owens, a frequent commentator on Fox News who is challenging Representative Ben McAdams, Democrat of Utah, reported bringing in a staggering $2.5 million during the third quarter fund-raising period, one of the biggest hauls for a Republican congressional candidate. But a review of his campaign’s financial disclosures showed that at least $135,500 — about 40 percent of the cash his campaign currently has on hand in the final stretch — was ineligible because the donors had contributed more than the legal limit. Individuals may donate up to $2,800 to a federal candidate per election, according to limits published by the Federal Election Commission. When campaigns receive donations from individuals that exceed those caps, officials must either refund the illegal contributions or reattribute them. The F.E.C. reached out to the campaign in August identifying one such excessive contribution, which the campaign refunded. But the campaign declined to say whether it had addressed the rest of the donations, or planned to. “With over 50,000 donors and with many campaign donations made electronically, excess contributions can occur without the campaign’s knowledge,” Jesse Ranney, a spokesman for the campaign, said in a statement. “That is why the F.E.C. has processes in place to handle this situation.” Such violations can come with fines in the tens of thousands of dollars, and can cast a cloud over campaigns. Representative Mia Love, the Republican who held the Utah district before Mr. McAdams, came under fire for accepting excessive contributions, as did Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, in her 2014 campaign. But the issue could prove particularly thorny for Mr. Owens, who has touted his fund-raising abilities and is in a deadlocked race. A September poll showed Mr. McAdams with a slight lead, but strategists in both parties have since acknowledged that the race has tightened. — Catie Edmondson After weeks of dangling the possibility of early coronavirus vaccine results by October, Pfizer’s chief executive said Tuesday that would now be nearly impossible. The announcement, by Dr. Albert Bourla, came on the same day that Pfizer announced third-quarter earnings, and all but ruled out the possibility of early results before the presidential election next Tuesday. President Trump had long sought to tie the possibility of positive vaccine news to his own prospects for re-election. In a call with investors on Tuesday, Dr. Bourla was pushed by Wall Street analysts to be more specific about when the company would have an idea of whether early results could show whether its vaccine is effective, and how much detail the company would provide when it is. Pfizer is one of four companies with large, late-stage clinical trials underway in the United States. In his remarks, he acknowledged the urgency of developing a vaccine amid a global resurgence in infections. In the United States over the past week, there have been an average of more than 71,000 coronavirus cases per day, and hospitalizations are increasing, too. “Let’s be very patient — I know how much the stress levels are growing,” Dr. Bourla said. “I know how much the vaccine is needed for the world.” He also pushed back against any suggestion that politics were motivating the speed of development, saying “this is not a Republican vaccine, or a Democrat vaccine.” Pfizer’s clinical trial is testing the vaccine in 44,000 people, half of whom have received a vaccine and half who have gotten a placebo. The trial’s protocol, or blueprint, allows for an initial look at results after at least 32 people in either group have developed Covid-19. If more than 26 of those people are in the placebo group, then the vaccine is considered likely to be effective. Dr. Bourla had repeatedly predicted that the initial analysis — which is conducted by an outside board of scientific experts — would come by the end of October. But on Tuesday, he said those 32 cases of Covid-19 had not yet occurred, a sign that the trial is progressing more slowly than the company had estimated. He also said the outside panel would need at least a week to analyze any results, making an answer before the election unlikely. Dr. Bourla said the company would report results if the outside board found the vaccine was either effective or not, but not if there is no definitive conclusion either way. Even if early results come over the next few weeks, most Americans are not likely to get the vaccine anytime soon. Under guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration, coronavirus vaccine developers must turn in at least two months of safety data after half of the trial’s participants have received the second dose of the vaccine, which Pfizer has said will not happen until at least the third week of November. Dr. Bourla said the company has already manufactured “hundreds of thousands” of doses. It expects to have at least 40 million doses by the end of the year, and 100 million doses by next March. A look at all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans. — Katie Thomas What little hope Americans had remaining that they would get a needed coronavirus relief package before the election was dashed late Monday when Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, adjourned the Senate for two weeks after its vote to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Already stalled for three months, prospects for a deal had largely faded, with Democrats, Senate Republicans and President Trump’s negotiators unable to come together on a deal to help keep struggling Americans afloat. The first round of stimulus, which included beefed-up unemployment benefits, support to small businesses and $1,200 checks to individuals, was considered largely successful in staving off a worse economic calamity in the spring, with tens of millions of Americans relying on it to pay their bills, avoid evictions and keep their businesses running. In a poll conducted this month by The New York Times and Siena College, a majority of likely voters said they supported a new $2 trillion stimulus package, while economists and the chair of the Federal Reserve have said an infusion of federal money would fuel an economic recovery now on shaky ground. Mr. Trump abruptly pulled the plug on the talks early this month, only to reverse course in recent weeks. Without offering specifics, Mr. Trump said he had instructed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to “go big or go home.” That statement put him at odds with Mr. McConnell, who cautioned the president against striking a deal with House Democrats. Senate Republicans did not want to spend more than $500 billion. Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke with Mr. Mnuchin for nearly an hour on Monday but failed to reach a deal, her deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, wrote on Twitter. While both the House and Senate can be called back for a vote with 24 hours notice, that appeared unlikely with Election Day less than a week away. The Senate will reconvene on Nov. 9 and could take up negotiations again.   But by then, the backdrop could be vastly different, depending on what happens on Election Day. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
