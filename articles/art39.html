Voters take center stage as Election Day brings a bitter campaign to a close. Trump says he will declare victory ‘when there is victory, if there is victory.’ Nearing the finish line in Scranton, Pa., Biden says, ‘You got to run through the tape, man.’ It was a relatively smooth start to Election Day, with some isolated incidents. In battleground states, lines at many polls were long but moved quickly. Statehouse seats are up for grabs — and with them, great power. As Democrats try to retake the Senate, Susan Collins of Maine fights for her political life. A Federal District Court judge on Tuesday ordered an immediate sweep of 12 postal districts searching for undelivered ballots after the Postal Service said in court that some 300,000 ballots it had received had not been scanned for delivery. The dramatic Election Day order came as record numbers of Americans have voted by mail this year, as many voters were anxious to avoid crowds at the polls during the pandemic — and at the end of a campaign season in which fears that recent Postal Service changes had caused extensive mail delays that could imperil ballots. The judge, Emmet G. Sullivan of the District of Columbia, ordered the sweep to begin before 3 p.m. to “ensure that no ballots have been held up and that any identified ballots are immediately sent out for delivery.” He said he was particularly concerned about ballot delivery in districts where there has been slow processing of ballots for days, including Central Pennsylvania, Philadelphia and Detroit. He ordered the Postal Service to provide him with an update on the sweep by 4:30 p.m. certifying that “sweeps were conducted and that no ballots were left behind.” Roughly 300,000 ballots that the U.S. Postal Service says it processed show no scan confirming their delivery to ballot-counting sites, according to data filed today in federal court in Washington, D.C., leaving voter-rights advocates concerned as low on-time delivery scores for mail ballots continue to plague some key swing districts. Postal officials say just because a ballot never received a final scan before going out for delivery doesn’t mean, necessarily, that it wasn’t delivered. A machine scanning ballots for final processing can sometimes miss ballots that are stuck together or whose bar codes are smudged. And hand-sorted ballots typically do not receive a final scan before delivery. The Postal Service has also authorized expedited delivery of ballots that forego the normal process, but voting-rights advocates are concerned that, without a scan verifying the ballots went out for delivery, some could be sitting uncounted at various postal facilities around the country. Data the Postal Service filed on Election Day showed continued low on-time processing scores for ballots delivered Monday in several battleground postal districts, including 69 percent in Central Pennsylvania, 79 percent in Philadelphia, 78 percent in Detroit, 61 percent in Atlanta and 74 percent in South Florida. All states require that mail ballots be postmarked by Election Day in order to count, but some allow a grace period for the ballots to arrive in the hands of elections officials. Pennsylvania, for instance, has a three-day window to receive ballots as long as they are postmarked by Nov. 3, but that is the subject of litigation.   The ballots in question should have been postmarked upon entering a postal facility, but the sweep will help determine whether any fell through the cracks, according to Shankar Duraiswamy, the lead attorney for the nonprofit coalition Vote Forward, which is suing the Postal Service to try to ensure all ballots are delivered. He asked for an order from Judge Sullivan requiring the Postal Service to verify by 3 p.m. that an inspector has visited facilities at all “hot spot” jurisdictions to “ensure that no ballots remain in the facility and that all ballots that were there earlier today are out for delivery this afternoon.” Mr. Duraiswamy said the order focuses on states that don’t have a statutory grace period for receiving ballots after Election Day. “No voter should be disenfranchised for something that is outside of his or her control,” he said. “These are districts we’ve identified as chronically underperforming.” Judge Sullivan ordered the Postal Service on Friday to undertake “extraordinary measures” to deliver the ballots in 22 districts where on-time delivery of ballots dipped below a rate of 90 percent for two days last week. The Postal Service reported it had discovered 180,000 pieces of delayed mail in Miami-Dade County in Florida, including more than 40 ballots, after a video taken inside a post office in disarray in the city of Homestead went viral of Friday. However, it said all but one of those ballots had now been delivered to elections officials. — Luke Broadwater  Voters went to the polls on Tuesday to write the final chapter of a presidential campaign that has been like no other, amid a coronavirus pandemic that has claimed more than 230,000 lives in the United States, cost millions of Americans their jobs and upended daily life and Election Day itself. More than 100 million people had already cast their ballots before the day even dawned — taking advantage of states’ efforts to make voting safer during the pandemic. Among the early voters were President Trump and his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who both decided to forgo the traditional Election Day photo op at the polls.Despite all the early voting, Election Day turnout still appeared heavy in many parts of the  country, as long lines formed at polling places in several battleground states, though most of the lines seemed to move quickly. And despite fears of widespread unrest at the climax of a bitterly fought campaign during which the president applauded and seemed to encourage acts of intimidation by his supporters, there were only scattered reports of disruption in the first hours of voting. Law enforcement agencies and federal authorities were bracing for the possibility of violence in the evening as voting results come in, or fail to. Battleground states including Michigan and Pennsylvania were making news on the eve of the election not just for 11th-hour campaign stops, but for setting one-day records for new coronavirus cases. Contrary to Mr. Trump’s repeated insistence that the nation is “rounding the turn” when it comes to the virus, the U.S. is seeing more new infections than ever. Dr. Deborah L. Birx, who helps lead the Trump administration’s coronavirus response, delivered a stark private warning to White House officials on Monday, telling them that the pandemic was entering a new and “deadly phase” that demands a more aggressive approach. Dr. Birx predicted that the United States would soon see days when the number of new cases exceeded 100,000, and she warned against the type of rallies that Mr. Trump has been holding, in which many attendees pack in close together without wearing masks. The failure to contain the virus has decimated whole industries — costing thousands of jobs in travel, leisure, dining and entertainment. There are now five million more people unemployed than when Mr. Trump took office in January 2017. And the recent recovery is showing signs of stalling, as hopes begin to fade that many jobs lost to pandemic would return swiftly. Hundreds of thousands of new jobless claims pour in every week; 2.4 million people have been unemployed for more than six months. Eight million people have slipped into poverty since May, according to researchers at Columbia University. Millions of students are not taking classes in person, as many of the nation’s largest school districts are still offering remote instruction or a hybrid that combines some in-person schooling with classes from home. And with the United States still suffering one of the worst outbreaks in the world, travelers have found a U.S. passport is not always welcomed anymore. The nation remains divided — and buffeted by fears of unrest and violence. As Election Day dawned, the sight of plywood being put up over windows from Washington to New York to Los Angeles sent an ominous sign. Amid that backdrop, both campaigns have sought to set expectations — but not in the way campaigns typically do. The Biden campaign is seeking to remind people that it is highly likely that the winner of the election will not be known tonight, with many key states indicating that releasing official results could take several days. And Mr. Trump has repeatedly made baseless claims seeking to undermine the integrity of the election, with most polls showing him trailing Mr. Biden. But even in the face of the added strains, there were long lines of eager voters ready to render their final verdict on the race in person, collect their “I voted” stickers and to walk out with the pride of taking part in a democratic process. — Michael Cooper and Patricia Cohen  As Election Day dawned, President Trump said Tuesday morning in an interview on “Fox & Friends” that he would declare victory “when there is victory, if there is victory.” Mr. Trump made the remarks when he was asked when he planned to declare victory — and whether he intended to declare it if early returns showed him leading, as some reports had suggested he might. “I think we will have victory,’’ a gravelly voiced Mr. Trump said. “I think the polls are, you know, suppression polls. And I think we will have victory. But only when there is victory. You know, there is no reason to play games.” At another point in the interview, when one of the hosts tried to get Mr. Trump to respond to criticism from his predecessor, President Obama, about the safety of Mr. Trump’s rallies amid a pandemic, the president instead started attacking Fox News. The network “has changed a lot,” Mr. Trump said, falsely saying they’ve “had Democrats on more than Republicans.” He complained: “Look, it’s different. I’m not complaining, I’m just telling people. But it’s one of the biggest differences this season compared to last.” Later, during a visit to a Republican National Committee annex in Arlington, Va., Mr. Trump was asked if  he had written an acceptance or concession speech. “No, I’m not thinking about concession speech or acceptance speech yet,” he told reporters. “Hopefully we’ll be only doing one of those two. You know, winning is easy. Losing is never easy, not for me it’s not.” Then he got more upbeat, citing the size of is recent airport rallies, which he claimed “the likes of which in the history of this country, probably in the history of the world, nobody has ever seen before.” Mr. Trump sounded tired, after spending all day Monday flying from rally to rally. He spent much of his last day on the campaign trail attacking the Supreme Court, accusing it of putting “our country in danger” by ruling to allow Pennsylvania to continue accepting absentee ballots after Election Day, at least for the time being. In Kenosha, Wis., the fourth of five rallies across four states, Mr. Trump told a crowd, without basis, that the justices had made a “political” decision that would lead to cheating by his opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. His comments followed an angry tweet in which he charged — without providing any evidence — that the court’s decision would “allow rampant and unchecked cheating” and “induce violence in the streets.” Twitter quickly flagged the president’s assertions as potentially false, saying that “some or all of the content shared in this tweet is disputed and might be misleading.” The president’s remarks in Wisconsin echoed his comments earlier, in Avoca, Pa., where he had suggested cryptically that the Supreme Court decision could be “physically dangerous” without explaining what he meant. Mr. Trump has for months falsely claimed that mail-in ballots are subject to rampant fraud despite overwhelming evidence that it is not true. In the last days of the campaign, Mr. Trump has focused intensely on Pennsylvania, where Republicans had legally challenged the state’s plan to accept absentee ballots for up to three days after Election Day. On Friday, the Supreme Court denied a plea from Republicans in the state asking the court to fast-track a decision on whether election officials could continue receiving absentee ballots for three days after Nov. 3. The justices said the court could revisit the decision after the election. — Maggie Haberman, Annie Karni, Michael D. Shear and Michael Cooper ON THE TRAIL TRANSCRIPT Hey, everybody, how are you? It’s good to be home. How are you doing over there? Joseph R. Biden Jr. returned to his Pennsylvania birthplace, Scranton, on the morning of Election Day, addressing supporters outside a carpenters’ union hall and visiting his childhood home. “It’s good to be home,” the former vice president said at a canvass kickoff, wearing a mask and speaking through a bullhorn with Biden-Harris stickers on it. “Scranton is where I learned, like you did, all my basic values.” As he chatted with supporters, he used a track and field analogy about finishing the race: “You got to run through the tape, man. You got to go all the way through the tape.” Mr. Biden also paid a visit to his childhood home, where he signed a message on the living room wall: “From this house to the White House with the grace of God.” “I watch you all the time,” Anne Kearns, who lives in the house now, told him. “I’m so proud of you.” Mr. Biden had started the day attending a Catholic church near his home in Delaware, with his wife, Jill, and two of their grandchildren, then visiting the cemetery where several members of his family are buried, including his son Beau, his first wife, Neilia, and their daughter, Naomi, according to a pool report. The Bidens then left for Pennsylvania, where Mr. Biden has focused the last days of his campaign. After visiting Scranton, he flew to Philadelphia to campaign. He plans to return to Delaware, which he represented in the U.S. Senate for decades, to address the nation tonight. Mr. Biden, his team has made clear, plans to speak regardless of the status of the race and how President Trump responds to the developments unfolding. Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, said on Tuesday that Mr. Biden, who has led Mr. Trump in the polls in several battleground states in the homestretch of the campaign, had many pathways to the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the election. She made the case that he could win even if he lost both Pennsylvania and Florida, another electoral vote-rich state where his campaign has spent significant time, though it is clear that losing Pennsylvania in particular would be a major risk and disappointment for the campaign. “We feel like we have a very good understanding of when the vote’s coming in, how it’s coming in and also our expectations of what we hope to see,” she said She was joined at the briefing by Bob Bauer, a former White House counsel who is helping to lead the Biden campaign’s election protection efforts. Mr. Bauer said that “by and large, voting is proceeding smoothly.” Tuesday is the third straight day that Mr. Biden, who lived in Scranton until he was 10, has campaigned in Pennsylvania. Beyond Scranton’s personal significance to Mr. Biden, northeastern Pennsylvania is a critical area in a state that Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump are battling over. Mr. Trump excelled in traditionally Democratic areas in northeastern Pennsylvania in the 2016 election, when he won the state by less than one percentage point. — Thomas Kaplan, Katie Glueck and Michael Cooper More than 100 million Americans had cast their ballots even before the polls opened on Election Day, a record early vote that showed that many people had taken advantage of the changes many states made to voting safer during the pandemic and suggested that the nation was on pace to set a record for turnout.   As the polls prepared to open on Tuesday, a staggering 100.3 million ballots had already been cast, according to the U.S. Elections Project, a nonpartisan website run by Michael P. McDonald, a University of Florida professor who compiles data from across the nation. That number is nearly three-quarters of the total of over 138 million votes cast in the 2016 election. Several states have already recorded more votes than they did during the whole 2016 election, including Texas, Washington, Montana and Hawaii, and several battleground states, including Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, were nearing their 2016 totals. The Trump and Biden campaigns were sifting through early vote data to try to figure out which potential supporters had yet to cast ballots, so they could target them during last-minute get-out-the-vote efforts. Political analysts and opinion polls have suggested that Republican voters are more likely to vote on the day of the election, while Democrats are more likely to vote early, especially by mail. So some analysts were looking at the early data to try to divine whether Democrats had built up enough of an early vote lead in key states to withstand a big Republican turnout on Election Day. Of course, no one will know until the election is over and all the votes are in. Here is a look at where things stand in several key states, according to data compiled by the elections project. In Florida, a perennially close state, Democrats built up a huge lead with mailed-in votes only to see Republicans eat into it by casting more early in-person votes. As Election Day dawned, registered Democrats had cast 39.1 percent of the early vote, registered Republicans 37.9 percent, and the rest were cast by voters with no party affiliation or who belonged to minor parties. In North Carolina, Democrats have cast 37.4 percent of the early vote, Republicans 31.7 percent, and the rest were cast by voters with no party affiliation or who belonged to minor parties. And in Nevada, Democrats have cast 39.5 percent of the early vote, Republicans 36.1 percent, and the rest were cast by voters with no party affiliation or who belonged to minor parties. More than 100 million ballots have already been cast in the general election. More Democrats are voting early by mail than Republicans. — Michael Cooper Despite fears about the potential for violence at the polls, including that illegal armed paramilitary groups might try to intimidate voters, relatively few incidents were reported during the morning, with early indications suggesting that voting was going relatively peacefully and for the most part smoothly, apart from some isolated incidents. There were scattered complaints about people shouting at voters in line and the like, but nothing out of the ordinary from any election year, said Kristen Clarke, who is heading a team of lawyers running the nationwide Election Protection Hotline. Bob Bauer, a former White House counsel who is helping to lead the Biden campaign’s election protection efforts, said that the campaign was seeing “minimal issues and disruptions” around voting, and that “by and large, voting is proceeding smoothly. But there were some sporadic acts of apparent voter intimidation that were reported on Tuesday. In Chicago, a man told the police that a group had clubbed his car with baseball bats as he drove near a polling site, according to Sally Brown, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Police Department. The staff at a museum in Kansas City, Mo., moved to cover up a spray-painted message reading “Don’t Vote.” The Michigan attorney general, Dana Nessel, said on Twitter that robocalls were directing voters to delay voting until Wednesday — which is, of course, after the election — to avoid long lines. “Obviously this is FALSE and an effort to suppress the vote. No long lines and today is the last day to vote,” Ms. Nessel said. “Don’t believe the lies! Have your voice heard!” After weeks of intelligence warnings of voter intimidation and potential violence at polling sites, there were few reports of disruptions. But law enforcement officials across the nation were still on high alert after a weekend of caravans were captured blocking roadways and an uptick of threats made online. Homeland Security intelligence warned last month that extremists could look to target “physical election infrastructure” like polling sites. Separately,  federal officials and local police were preparing for mass unrest going into election night with the Homeland Security Department deploying tactical agents from Customs and Border Protection and ICE throughout the United States to stand by to protect federal property. A new fence was being erected near Lafayette Square, the scene of clashes between protesters and the police this summer. Retailers and banks from Boston to Philadelphia and beyond have beefed up security. Disney and Saks Fifth Avenue were among the brand-name stories in Manhattan that boarded up their windows. And Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills has been closed for Election Day and the day after. The preparations reflect a nationwide anxiety produced by a bitter contest between President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr., and the widespread fear that things could get ugly no matter who wins — or when the results are finalized. — Zolan Kanno-Youngs, Neil MacFarquhar and Kathleen Gray The first legal skirmishes of Election Day broke out soon after polls opened in Pennsylvania on Tuesday. The Trump campaign pressed complaints that election workers in Philadelphia were not giving their observers enough access to ballot-counting areas, and Republicans moved in a suburban county just outside the city to stop officials from giving voters an additional opportunity to vote after their mail ballots were rejected for having errors. The moves were in keeping with the Trump campaign’s open effort to disqualify ballots in Democratic strongholds of competitive states. In a tweet, the Trump campaign’s Election Day director, Mike Roman, posted a photo of a cavernous ballot-counting room set up inside the Philadelphia Convention Center showing metal barricades that were set up several yards away from the work stations for those tabulating the votes. “NOW they’re keeping our poll watchers so far from the counting tables there’s NO WAY to ACTUALLY observe,” Mr. Roman wrote. “What are they hiding?? THIS MUST STOP!!!” As the morning went on, Mr. Roman followed with tweets warning that Democrats were seeking to “steal” the election in Philadelphia. The developments came soon after President Trump predicted on Fox News that “Philadelphia will be a disaster.” In a brief interview, Mr. Roman said, “We’re just making sure the rules are followed; we follow the rules the way everyone else should.” In suburban Montgomery County, just outside Philadelphia, Republicans filed a complaint this morning arguing against the county’s efforts to contact voters whose mail ballots were rejected because of errors and get them to cast provisional ballots. The complaint said that the county was causing illegal “re-votes.” Anticipating such a suit, Pennsylvania’s top election official, Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, a Democrat, had said on Monday, “There’s nothing in the law that would prohibit a county from reaching out to a voter because they had a ballot bounce back or an application bounce back.” — Jim Rutenberg and Nick Corasaniti Outside polling places in Philadelphia and Milwaukee, long lines of voters toting mugs of coffee and scrolling through their phones seemed to move swiftly, relieving fears of exorbitant wait times. Nearly 100 million people across the United States had already cast their ballots as the polls opened Tuesday morning, though many held out so they could vote on Election Day. “I’m glad to see people out and excited about America and the freedoms we enjoy here,” said Carrie Wiza, 64, a Trump supporter who waited in a line of about 100 people outside St. John Neumann Catholic Parish in Waukesha, a city just outside Milwaukee. In West Philadelphia, two dozen people waited outside a recreation center to vote. Many said they were relieved the election would soon be over. “At times it’s gotten the best of me, and I find myself obsessively watching politics, and trying to be aware of what’s going on as it relates to me and my family and my community,” said Damen Williams, 40, who trains service dogs for disabled veterans. In parts of North Carolina, the robust early voting efforts meant no lines outside polling stations in Orange, Durham and Alamance counties on Tuesday morning. One poll worker in Orange County said there were only 600 people — less than 20 percent of the total voters in the precinct — who had not yet cast their ballots. In Michigan, where 30,000 poll workers were recruited to help deal with an Election Day crush, only a dozen workers needed to help in cities like Pontiac and Grand Rapids. In Fulton County, Ga., the state’s most populous county, officials had to deal with a few 11th-hour problems involving the delivery of voting equipment. Still, officials said that polling places were firing on all cylinders by Tuesday morning. At the Central Park Recreation Center, in Atlanta’s fast-evolving Old Fourth Ward neighborhood, about a dozen people had lined up before 7 a.m., when the polls were officially opened. Some said they chose to line up early because of the catastrophe the state’s elections system suffered during the June 9 primary, when voters spent hours in line. Jerry Hall said he arrived outside the precinct around 4:15 a.m. not because of anxiety about wait times, but because he was an insomniac. “Either way, I would have been up,” said Mr. Hall, 70, a custodian. The Fulton County elections director, Richard Barron, said on Monday that turnout on Tuesday could break records for his jurisdiction, with between 140,000 and 170,000 voters expected to cast ballots in person. At the higher turnout, more than 80 percent of the county’s registered voters would have cast a ballot. — Maria Cramer, Kay Nolan, Jon Hurdle, Michael Venutolo-Mantovani, Kathleen Gray and Sean Keenan Abortion. Guns. Police. Schools. Health care. Covid-19. These are just a few of the issues that state legislatures will make laws about next year. Not to mention the once-a-decade event: redrawing state and national electoral maps after the decennial census, an exercise that can give one political party a deep and enduring advantage in lawmaking for years. So, while the campaigns for president and seats in Congress may have absorbed much of the nation’s attention, the elections to determine control of state government — more than 5,000 legislative races farther down the ballot — could also have a major effect on Americans’ lives. About 80 percent of the nation’s 7,383 state legislative seats are up for grabs this year, with elections in 44 states, according to Tim Storey, an expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures, or N.C.S.L. The stakes are high for both parties. Democrats are on offense in state elections this year, trying to pry chambers away from G.O.P. control, but Mr. Storey said it was highly unlikely that the Democrats would make gains anywhere close to those that Republicans scored in the 2010 election cycle, when they gained a whopping 24 chambers, the culmination of a historic realignment of Southern legislatures toward the Republican Party. Demographic change is slow, he said, and movement of a state from one party to the other is usually gradual. A few of the chambers Democrats are aiming to flip, he said, are the Texas House, the North Carolina House and Senate, the Arizona House and Senate, the Minnesota Senate, and the Pennsylvania, Michigan and Iowa Houses. Republicans, for their part, are looking to take New Hampshire’s House and Senate. Republicans have a distinct advantage in statehouses today. Of the 98 partisan legislative chambers in 49 states, about three-fifths — 59 chambers — are controlled by Republicans, and the remaining 39 by Democrats, according to the N.C.S.L. (Nebraska’s Legislature has only one chamber and its elections are officially nonpartisan.) In all but one of the states with two chambers (Minnesota is the exception), the same party controls both chambers. That is an effect of rising polarization and the growing tendency of voters to stick with a single political party up and down the ballot. The 2010 Republican sweep coincided with a census, giving Republicans disproportionate control just when lines were to be redrawn for congressional and state electoral districts across the country. The effects are still being felt today. The redistricting process begins again next year, when the Census Bureau delivers population data to each state. That usually happens by April 1, though the timeline is less certain this year because of delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and by continuing litigation. — Sabrina Tavernise “Keep calm, vote on,” Christopher Krebs, the man responsible for keeping America’s voting infrastructure safe from foreign interference and domestic disaster, told reporters early on Election Day. “And then, after today, keep calm and let them count.” For Mr. Krebs, a former Microsoft executive who has seemed like an apolitical anomaly in President Trump’s highly politicized Department of Homeland Security, it was a telling comment — at a culminating moment. For the past four years, he has charged ahead with an aggressive plan to build resilience into the American voting system, getting states to use more paper backups, running drills for state election officials and creating a “rumor control” website. His admirers, who include a large number of Democrats, often wonder aloud how he has remained employed as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The answer is that he has learned to navigate just under the radar of Mr. Trump, never openly contradicting him — and rarely using his name — while delivering a very different message than the one coming from the president. That is essentially what he did on Tuesday morning: his “keep calm and let them count” comment ran contrary to Mr. Trump’s repeated declarations that results have to be announced Tuesday night, and the battery of lawyers the president has prepared to challenge counts that go later into the week, as mail-in ballots are tabulated. On Tuesday, Mr. Krebs cautioned that things will go wrong in the natural course of an Election Day. But he also touted how American intelligence agencies had quickly determined last month that threatening emails sent to a few hundred voters that appeared to be from the “Proud Boys,” a right-wing extremist group, had actually been sent by Iranians. He also pointed to new efforts by a Russian-based hacking team. None worked, so far. “We are not out of the woods yet,” Mr. Krebs said. “Today in some sense is halftime.” — David E. Sanger With Democrats  seeking to pick up enough seats to take control of the Senate for the first time since 2015, vulnerable Republicans and their Democratic challengers made their closing arguments as Americans cast their votes. In Maine, where the moderate Republican incumbent, Susan Collins, has been trailing her Democratic opponent, Sara Gideon, in the polls, Ms. Collins returned to her hometown, Caribou, on Tuesday, where she greeted supporters ahead of a day packed with visits to small businesses, shops and restaurants. Billing herself as “our senator,” Ms. Collins has sought to highlight her prowess as a local advocate as she tries to overcome the millions of dollars spent against her and simmering outrage over her key votes to approve the 2017 Republican tax plan and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination. Ms. Gideon, the state’s speaker of the House, has capitalized on national anger over the Trump administration and the Republican majority in the Senate, framing her candidacy as part of a broader vision for Democratic voters eager to see their party in power and their priorities addressed, including systemic inequalities and climate change. “Mainers are ready for new leadership,” Ms. Gideon said at her final campaign event Monday night. “Mainers are ready, also, not just to look at what is going wrong or to fight against what we need to do differently, but to have a vision of what we can be instead, and to grow into that.” With Republicans holding the Senate majority by a margin of 53 to 47, a net gain of three seats would put Democrats in control if Joseph R. Biden Jr. wins the presidency; four would be required if President Trump is re-elected. In addition to Ms. Collins’s race, Senate races where Republican incumbents are considered most vulnerable include these: Arizona: Senator Martha McSally, a Trump ally appointed to the late John McCain’s seat, is facing the Democrat Mark Kelly, a former astronaut, in a special election for the rest of Mr. McCain’s term. Colorado: Senator Cory Gardner has trailed his Democratic challenger, former Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, in polls throughout the campaign. Georgia: There are races for both Senate seats this year, and both are close. In one, Senator David Perdue is fending off a stiff challenge from the Democrat Jon Ossoff, a former investigative journalist. The other is a wild multicandidate race for the seat held by the Republican Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed to succeed Senator Johnny Isakson, who retired for health reasons. In a special election for the remainder of his term, Ms. Loeffler faces a Republican challenger, Representative Doug Collins, and a Democratic challenge from the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock of Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church. If no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote, a runoff will be held in January between the top two finishers. Iowa: Joni Ernst, a freshman senator, has been running neck and neck with her Democratic challenger, Theresa Greenfield, a former real estate developer. North Carolina: The incumbent Thom Tillis is trying to hold on against Cal Cunningham, a Democrat, in what is set to be the most expensive Senate contest ever, with well over $200 million expended. In Alabama, the Democrats are bracing to lose a seat, as the Democratic incumbent Doug Jones has been trailing the Republican Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach. — Andy Newman and Emily Cochrane Facebook, Twitter and YouTube plan to take a series of steps on Election Day to prevent the spread of misinformation, particularly around the results and the integrity of voting. At Facebook, an operations center staffed by dozens of employees — what the company calls a war room — will work Tuesday to identify efforts to destabilize the election. The team, which will work virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic, has already been in action, Facebook said. In a Twitter post on Monday night, Facebook said that the team was also tracking “potentially dangerous activity we saw with the swarming of Biden campaign buses this weekend,” a reference to the caravan of Trump supporters that surrounded a Biden campaign bus in Texas. “We are monitoring closely and will remove content calling for coordinated harm or interference with anyone’s ability to vote,” it added. Facebook’s app also will look different on Tuesday. To prevent candidates from prematurely and inaccurately declaring victory, the company plans to add a notification at the top of News Feeds letting people know that no winner has been chosen until election results are verified by news outlets like Reuters and The Associated Press. Twitter’s strategy is twofold. One group of employees will work to root out false claims and networks of bots that spread such information by using both algorithms and human analysts, while another team will highlight reliable information in the Explore and Trends sections of its service. Twitter plans to add labels to tweets from candidates who claim victory before the election is called by authoritative sources. At least two news outlets will need to independently project the results before a candidate can use Twitter to celebrate his or her win, the company said. On Monday, Twitter labeled a post by Richard Grenell, President Trump’s former acting director of national intelligence, showing Joseph R. Biden Jr. on a campaign plane without a mask as manipulated media. The photo used by Mr. Grenell, a former U.S. ambassador to Germany, was from 2019 before the pandemic. But social media companies had a haphazard response on Monday to a video of Mr. Biden that was deceptively edited to make it appear as though he were admitting to voter fraud, labeling some versions of the video and not others. The video was viewed more than 17 million times on social media platforms, according to Avaaz, a progressive human-rights nonprofit that studied it. The video was an edited clip from an Oct. 24 appearance by Mr. Biden, on the podcast “Pod Save America,” in which he discussed the Obama administration’s efforts to combat voter fraud and said that he had put together “the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.” YouTube said it would be especially sensitive about videos that attempt to challenge the election’s integrity. YouTube already does not allow videos that mislead voters about how to vote or the eligibility of a candidate, or that incite people to interfere with the voting process. The company said it would take down such videos quickly, even if one of the speakers was a presidential candidate. As the polls close, YouTube will feature a playlist of live election results coverage from what it deems authoritative news sources. — Mike Isaac, Kate Conger, Daisuke Wakabayashi, Neil Vigdor and Sheera Frenkel The results are already in from two New Hampshire towns where voters famously head to the polls just after the stroke of midnight on Election Day. In Dixville Notch, where a handful of masked residents voted shortly after midnight on Tuesday, all five votes for president went to Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee. He is the first presidential candidate to sweep the general election vote in Dixville Notch since the midnight voting tradition began there in 1960, when Richard M. Nixon won all nine votes over John F. Kennedy. The other northern New Hampshire town that voted around the same time on Tuesday, Millsfield, favored President Trump by 16 votes to 5. A third town, Hart’s Location, canceled its traditional midnight voting this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The 48 voters there will have to wait until the morning like everyone else. Antsy journalists and political types often look to these New Hampshire towns for clues as to how the election will unfold across the country, but they have a spotty track record. While Millsfield voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, Dixville Notch went for Hillary Clinton. And in the Democratic primary election — which also kicks off in New Hampshire — Dixville Notch cast three of its five votes this year for Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York. He suspended his campaign less than a month later. — Jennifer Jett It remains one of the most surprising facts about voting in the United States: While the popular vote elects members of Congress, mayors, governors, state legislators and even more obscure local officials, it does not determine the winner of the presidency, the highest office in the land. That important decision ultimately falls to the Electoral College. When Americans cast their ballots, they are actually voting for a slate of electors appointed by their state’s political parties who are pledged to support that party’s candidate. (They don’t always do so.) This leads to an intense focus on key battleground states, as candidates look to increase their electoral advantage by targeting states that can help them reach the needed 270 votes of the total 538 total up for grabs. The Electoral College also inspires many what-if scenarios, some of them more likely than others. How did this system evolve, and will it ever change? What happens in a tie? And what’s different about Nebraska and Maine? We’ve got answers to all your Electoral College questions. — Allyson Waller It’s a thrill to be the first news organization to declare the winner of a presidential race. But no journalist wants to be stuck with the job of reversing a blown call. That’s how it went for NBC’s Tom Brokaw and other news anchors in 2000, after they reported that Al Gore had defeated George W. Bush. “We don’t just have egg on our face,” Mr. Brokaw told viewers. “We have an omelet.” At the end of a 2020 campaign complicated by significant early voting and unfounded claims by President Trump that the election has been “rigged,” journalists have pledged caution going into Tuesday night. They remember all too well how Mr. Trump defied the polls four years ago, and they do not want to be caught off guard off again. With their interactive maps and coifed pundits, the broadcast networks and cable news outlets are set up to deliver some spectacle along with the news — but they have vowed to be prudent. “Frankly, the well-being of the country depends on us being cautious, disciplined and unassailably correct,” Noah Oppenheim, the NBC News president, said in a recent interview. “We are committed to getting this right.” Susan Zirinsky, the president of CBS News, said the team she oversees will try to manage the expectations of impatient viewers. “We’re preparing the audience that this might not be over in one night,” Ms. Zirinsky said. In the United States — which, unlike many other countries, does not have a national electoral commission — the role of calling the winners of presidential elections falls to the news media. Here’s how it will work: Each TV network makes its own state-by-state determinations. ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC, as part of the group of news organizations belonging to the National Election Pool, base their calls on data gathered by Edison Research. The Associated Press, which has assigned 4,000 reporters to collect information from county clerks in 50 states, conducts its own count. Fox News, starting in 2018, has relied on a model that draws from data provided by The A.P. Major news organizations, including NPR, PBS and the newspaper chains Gannett and McClatchy, wait for The A.P. to call races before they report results. Other outlets, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, use data from The A.P. to help them make their own determinations. Reuters will deliver results in collaboration with the National Election Pool. The A.P. has been known for its cautious approach since it started tracking the vote in 1848, when Zachary Taylor won the presidency. In 2000, The A.P. resisted the temptation to declare a winner in the race between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush. “If there’s no way for the trailing candidate to catch up, no legal way, no mathematical way, then the race is decided, essentially,” Sally Buzbee, The A.P.’s executive editor, said. “And if there is any uncertainty, or if there are enough votes out to change the result, then we don’t call the race.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
