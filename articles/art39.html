Live Updates: ‘Trump Hasn’t Grown Into the Job Because He Can’t,’ Obama Will Say<br></h1><p id="artcont">Emma González will narrate a video as the convention highlights gun violence. In virtual caucus meetings, Biden and Harris reach out to voters of color. Obama will return to the D.N.C. with a searing takedown of Trump. Ratings for the virtual convention held steady on its second, less-starry night. The Democrats approved a platform setting out the party’s agenda. The Supreme Court will hear a suit seeking to overturn Obamacare a week after the election. At the convention’s midpoint, a liberal and diverse party with older, moderate leaders. Hillary Clinton will tell the convention ‘this can’t be another woulda coulda shoulda election.’ Rosalind Wyman has been a delegate at every Democratic National Convention since 1952, save the one in 1968. And, at age 89, she was certain that this year would be no different. Until a pandemic ruined her streak. This week, Ms. Wyman has been hibernating in her Los Angeles home, relegated to watching the spectacle on TV in her den. “It feels so lonesome when you don’t have all the crowds and the excitement of the convention,” Ms. Wyman said. In her house, the convention is blaring from television sets in four rooms. “I have it so that I won’t miss anything,” she said. She cheers from her chair, upholstered in blue, the color of Democrats. “For hard-core operatives, the convention is the Christmas of politics every four years; it’s the quinceañera for political parties,” said Guillermo Meneses, a former Democratic National Committee staff member. “The fact it’s not happening is a huge disappointment for them.” Ms. Wyman is the longest-serving member of the Democratic National Committee and the longest-serving member of the California Democratic Party. Had the in-person gathering in Milwaukee not been scrapped, she would have been one of the oldest delegates in attendance. After the second night of this week’s convention, Ms. Wyman was starting to believe that an online convention might work. “They did a first-class job with this Zooming stuff,” she said. But Ms. Wyman said she was not ready to do away with the boisterous intimacy of an in-person event. “Bringing all these people together, it has a value for the party and to those who look at it,” she said. “It’s human beings sharing with each other, touching each other, talking to each other, even if arguing.” — Miriam Jordan President Trump spoke positively on Wednesday about proponents of the QAnon conspiracy theory, telling reporters at the White House that he had “heard that it is gaining in popularity.” “I don’t know much about the movement, other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate,” Mr. Trump said. “But I don’t know much about the movement,” Trump said. Mr. Trump claimed not to know that the central premise of the QAnon movement is a false belief that he is saving the world from a Satanic cult made up of Democratic pedophiles and cannibals. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned that QAnon poses a potential domestic terrorism threat. “I don’t know really anything about it other than they do, supposedly like me,” he said. The president’s response amounted to a remarkable public expression of support for a fringe conspiracy movement that has inspired outbursts of violence. He pointedly did not condemn the movement, instead appearing to suggest that the believers are motivated by opposition to the recent racial justice protests that have taken place in cities across the United States. The QAnon theory predates the current wave of protests by several years. “These are people that don’t like seeing what’s going on in places like Portland, in places like Chicago and New York, and other cities and states,” Mr. Trump said during a news conference in the White House briefing room. “And I’ve heard these are people that love our country and they just don’t like seeing it.” Asked whether he agrees with the movement’s theories about his role in saving the world from a Satanic cult, Mr. Trump said, “I haven’t heard that.” But he added: “Is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing. If I can help save the world from problems, I’m willing to do it I’m willing to put myself out there.” The president’s comments came after he congratulated Laura Loomer, a proponent of anti-Muslim conspiracy theories, for winning a Republican congressional primary in Florida on Tuesday, tweeting: “Great going Laura. You have a great chance against a Pelosi puppet!” The president’s support of Ms. Loomer echoes his backing for Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican congressional candidate in Georgia who promotes the QAnon conspiracy theory. In both cases, the women are open about their fringe views. — Michael D. Shear Emma González, a survivor of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting who has become a prominent advocate for stricter gun laws, narrated a video that will play during the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday. “People affected by everyday gun violence have to walk by the street corner where their best friend, their brother, their mother, their nephew, where they themselves were shot,” Ms. González says in the video, her voice breaking, “and life goes on and on as if we all haven’t just watched a loved one die and get put in the grave.” She continues, “Until one of us or all of us stand up and say, ‘I can’t do this anymore, I can’t sit by and watch the news treat these shootings like acts of God’ — gun violence isn’t just going to stop until there’s a force fighting harder against it, and I’m going to do something to prevent it.” The video will air as part of a segment that is also scheduled to include DeAndra Dycus, whose son was paralyzed by a stray bullet in Indianapolis at age 13, and former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who was nearly killed in a mass shooting in Tucson, Ariz., in 2011. Though it has been overshadowed this year by the coronavirus, the economy and the national uprising over police violence and systemic racism, gun violence has become a motivating issue for many Democratic voters, especially young ones — and Parkland survivors like Ms. González have been at the forefront of the movement through March for Our Lives, the group they started in 2018. The party’s presidential field, including its eventual nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr., embraced a long list of gun control policies during the primary, including buybacks of assault weapons, so-called red flag laws and civil liability for gun manufacturers when their weapons are used in crimes. — Maggie Astor Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Kamala Harris sought to appeal to Black, Latino and Asian-American voters on Wednesday, taking a swing through three virtual caucus meetings held during a socially distant Democratic convention. In pre-recorded remarks to the D.N.C.’s Hispanic Caucus, Mr. Biden echoed several speakers in asserting that Latinos held “extraordinary power to shape this election.” “There’s no question that this is a challenging time. And it is so often the case when hard times hit, Latino families are bearing a disproportionate share of the burden,” he said. “We owe it to those families to stand up and fight for them.” About an hour later, in remarks to the D.N.C. Black Caucus, Mr. Biden recalled the late Representative John Lewis, a civil rights icon, and urged viewers to “carry his legacy forward” by pressing ahead to “unify this nation” and “fight for greater equity and justice.” Ms. Harris joined a meeting of the D.N.C. Asian-American and Pacific Islander Caucus, in which she discussed the rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans during the coronavirus pandemic, calling it “absolutely unacceptable,” according to a pool report. The remarks by the Democratic nominees for president and vice president capped hourslong meetings in which community advocates and activists and elected officials spoke about voting rights, representation and other community concerns. Speakers at the Black and Hispanic Caucus meetings stressed the need for people to vote, noting that their communities had come under attack during the Trump presidency. “Now it is time for venganza — it is time for us to get our revenge,” said Dolores Huerta, a veteran community organizer. “What does that look like? It’s called the ballot.” Several elected officials at the A.A.P.I. caucus meeting celebrated Ms. Harris’s selection as the Democratic ticket’s vice president, noting her Indian-American heritage and the importance of representation. Representative Mark Takano of California told viewers that his great-uncle was among the many Japanese-Americans who died fighting in World War II as his relatives were being forced into internment camps. “Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, this multiracial ticket, is what my great-uncle laid down his life for — the promise of America,” Mr. Takano said. — Matt Stevens Former President Barack Obama plans to rip into President Trump with a ferocity few presidents — outside of Mr. Trump — have ever used to describe a peer, accusing his successor of running a “reality show” White House to benefit “himself and his friends,” according to advance excerpts of his Wednesday convention speech. Mr. Obama, who has cast aside his initial reticence to engage with a successor who has leveled insults, taunts and false accusations, will speak from Philadelphia — the city of his landmark address on race in 2008. “I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously; that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care,” Mr. Obama plans to say. “But he never did. He’s shown no interest in putting in the work; no interest in finding common ground; no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends; no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves. Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t.” The purpose of Mr. Obama’s unvarnished assessment of Mr. Trump, people close to him maintain, is not defending his own legacy or extracting revenge. It is to draw a contrast between the incumbent and his buddy Mr. Biden. “Twelve years ago, when I began my search for a vice president, I didn’t know I’d end up finding a brother,” he will say, according to the excerpts. Shortly before the 2016 election, Mr. Obama told supporters that he would consider it “a personal insult” if America chose a bombastic reality television star who trafficked in racist conspiracy theories and stood against everything that he had spent eight years building. America did it anyway. “This stings,” Mr. Obama confessed afterward. Four years later, Mr. Obama returns to the national stage on Wednesday night seeking vindication — a second chance to redeem his legacy and prove to history that Mr. Trump’s election was an anomaly, not a permanent repudiation. The story line that Mr. Obama and his allies promoted for years was that his election as the first Black president and a leader of a new generation demonstrated a fundamental change in the country. Instead, he left behind a nation that, on some level at least, embraced his polar opposite. “Each president kind of begets the next guy,” William M. Daley, who served as Mr. Obama’s White House chief of staff, said in an interview before Mr. Obama’s convention speech, to be delivered in front of the Museum of the American Revolution. “He’s got to clarify what about him didn’t beget this guy. Why did the eight years not change the country when we thought in ’08 things were different?”  — Peter Baker and Glenn Thrush The television audience for the Democratic National Convention held steady on Tuesday with about 18.2 million people tuning in live for the second night, down only slightly from Monday’s opener, according to Nielsen. Those numbers will be reassuring to the Democrats producing a highly unusual televised spectacle without the customary you-are-there live coverage, although TV viewership overall was still down roughly 25 percent from 2016. Network executives attribute the decline in part to the virtual nature of this year’s event and the rise in popularity of streaming services. The Nielsen figures do not reflect online or streaming views, which are difficult to credibly measure. Younger people in particular prefer to watch the convention online, though traditional TV networks tend to attract the older voters that Democrats are seeking to win over. Tuesday’s top-rated network, MSNBC, increased its audience from Monday, drawing 5.24 million viewers between 10 p.m. and 11:15 p.m. MSNBC aired a mostly unfiltered broadcast of the virtual roll call and speeches by former Secretary of State John Kerry and Jill Biden. CNN attracted the most viewers between ages 25 and 54, the most coveted advertising demographic in the TV industry. Fox News’s ratings for its convention coverage fell below its prime-time average, but the cable channel still outranked CBS in total viewers between 10 and 11:15 p.m. — Michael M. Grynbaum Democrats officially approved a new party platform on Tuesday night, outlining a sweeping set of policies on key issues including health care, climate change and the economy. But the platform also reinforced divisions among the party’s moderates and its liberal wing, which has expressed disappointment that the official Democratic agenda does not support “Medicare for all,” the universal, single-payer health care proposal championed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont that has become a pillar of the progressive movement. Some Democrats refused to vote for the platform as a form of protest. A largely symbolic document, the party platform does not contain specific legislation or binding commitments. Taken as a whole, however, it provides a broad look at the party’s agenda and the principles and values that Democrats, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., embrace. Here are some of the planks: Making public colleges and universities tuition-free for students whose families earn less than $125,000 Eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 and achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for all new buildings by 2030 Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026 A path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, fast-tracking the process for workers who have been essential during the pandemic The platform was written by a drafting committee that included members from the party’s progressive and more moderate wings. The Democratic National Committee’s platform committee then voted on the platform — this year in a recorded roll call via a secure website — before sending it to all of the delegates who voted remotely on whether to approve it.  — Sydney Ember and Matt Stevens The Supreme Court announced Wednesday that it would hear arguments in the latest case seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act — one backed by President Trump — on Nov. 10, a week after the presidential election. Democrats have seized on Mr. Trump’s support of the case, brought in 2018 by Republican state officials, as an election issue and have repeatedly mentioned it at their convention this week. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee and former vice president under Barack Obama, has campaigned on protecting and improving the Affordable Care Act. The law was the signature domestic achievement of the Obama presidency and has led to millions more Americans having health coverage even as the cost remains out of reach for others. The suit awaiting the Supreme Court argues that when Congress in 2017 zeroed out the law’s penalty for failing to obtain health insurance, it rendered the entire law unconstitutional. The Trump administration sided with the state officials, arguing that the rest of the 2010 law could not survive without the penalty, also called the individual mandate. A federal judge in Texas agreed late in 2018 but postponed the effects of his ruling pending an appeal. An appeals court late last year agreed that the mandate had become unconstitutional but declined to rule on the rest of the health law, asking the lower court to reconsider the question in more detail. That led the defendants — Democratic states and the House of Representatives, which intervened in the case — to ask the Supreme Court to hear the appeal. — Abby Goodnough During their convention, Democrats have presented a unified front on racial justice, declaring that the status quo is not acceptable. But beneath the surface lies broad disagreement over policing, with the reform-oriented proposals of Joseph R. Biden Jr. falling well short of progressive activists’ demands. The gap was evident in a line Mr. Biden delivered during a discussion on the convention’s opening night: “Most cops are good, but the fact is, the bad ones need to be identified and prosecuted.” His words struck many activists as discordant at a moment when the police killing of George Floyd has spurred nationwide calls for rethinking law enforcement. Progressives say they see unprecedented momentum to transform policing that they can’t let slip away in an election year. “What I’m concerned about is the continued conversation about it being a few bad apples as opposed to systemic racism in the system,” said Jamaal Bowman, the Bronx Democrat who ousted the longtime Representative Eliot Engel in a June primary. “Part of our issue is recognizing that racism is not an individual-to-individual problem, it’s our system. It’s part of America’s DNA because we’ve never reckoned with our history of slavery.” — Reid J. Epstein and John Eligon TRANSCRIPT “Welcome.” “Welcome.” “Welcome —” “— to the second night —” “— of the Democratic National Convention.” “This is a different kind of convention.” “This year —” “— all of us are on the stage.” “And we’ve got a lot to say.” “The presidential election is the world’s most important job interview. At the end, we hire a leader to help us solve problems, create opportunities and give our kids better tomorrows. That’s a tall order this year, with the Covid-19 outbreak on a path to killing 200,000 people and destroying millions of jobs and small businesses. How did Donald Trump respond? Only when Covid exploded in even more states did he encourage people to wear masks. By then, many more were dying. When asked about the surge in deaths, he shrugged and said, ‘It is what it is.’ At a time like this. the Oval Office should be a command center. Instead, it’s a storm center. There’s only chaos. Just one thing never changes: his determination to deny responsibility and shift the blame. The buck never stops there.” “Under our procedural rules, two Democratic candidates submitted nominating documents to our convention secretary for the office of president of the United States: Senator Bernie Sanders and Vice President Joe Biden.” “In a time when millions of people in the United States are looking for deep systemic solutions to our crises of mass evictions, unemployment and lack of health care, en el espíritu del pueblo, and out of a love for all people, I hereby second the nomination of Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont for president of the United States of America.” “I take powerful people up on my elevator all the time. When they get off, they go to their important meetings. Me, I just head back to the lobby. But in the short time I spent with Joe Biden, I could tell he really saw me, that he actually cared. That’s why I nominate my friend Joe Biden as the next president of the United States.” “We’ll now proceed to a roll call by states.” “As an Arizona Latina, I proudly cast our votes: 29 for Bernie Sanders and 51 for our next president, Joe Biden.” “The calamari comeback state of Rhode Island casts one vote for Bernie Sanders and 34 votes for the next president, Joe Biden.” “Delaware is proud to cast its 32 votes for our favorite son and our next president —” “— our friend, Delaware’s Joe Biden.” [music, “Celebration” by Kool and the Gang] [cheering] “I’m pleased to announce that Vice President Joe Biden has officially been nominated by the Democratic Party as our candidate for president of the United States.” “Thank you very, very much from the bottom of my heart. Thank you all. It means the world to me and my family.” “Before Donald Trump, we used to talk about American exceptionalism. The only thing exceptional about the incoherent Trump foreign policy is that it has made our nation more isolated than ever before.” “Our country needs a commander in chief who takes care of our troops in the same way he would his own family. For Joe Biden, that doesn’t need teaching. It comes from the experience he shares with millions of military families: sending his beloved son off to war and praying to God he would come home safe.” “You know, motherhood came to me in a way I never expected. I fell in love with a man and two little boys standing in the wreckage of unthinkable loss, mourning a wife and mother, a daughter and sister. How do you make a broken family whole? The same way you make a nation whole: with love and understanding, and with small acts of kindness, with bravery, with unwavering faith. The burdens we carry are heavy, and we need someone with strong shoulders. I know that if we entrust this nation to Joe, he will do for your family what he did for ours: bring us together and make us whole, carry us forward in our time of need, keep the promise of America for all of us.” “Great job. God love you, I don’t know how you ...” For all of the speakers and images showcasing diversity, and the remarks emphasizing progressive goals, another reality is clear at this midway point in the four-day Democratic convention: This is a party dominated by a 77-year-old white male and leaders from the past with whom he is comfortable, holding to a platform and a campaign that is more centrist and establishment-heavy than left-wing. Of the eight political figures who got the most speaking time Tuesday, only Sally Q. Yates, the 59-year-old former acting attorney general, is younger than 69 years old. Only Colin Powell, 83, isn’t white, and Ms. Yates was the only woman who didn’t appear in a capacity as a political spouse. That will shift somewhat tonight, when Senator Elizabeth Warren and Speaker Nancy Pelosi speak, and major roles go to Kamala Harris, the vice-presidential nominee, and former President Barack Obama. But it won’t feel like the future-oriented convention of 2008, when a 47-year-old Mr. Obama minted a new image and new coalition for the Democratic Party. On the first two nights of the convention, the energy embodied by the party’s progressive movement was shoehorned into two speakers: Senator Bernie Sanders, who on Monday urged his followers to swallow their disappointment and back Joseph R. Biden Jr., and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who in her 90-second Tuesday slot made a pitch for “a movement striving to recognize and repair the wounds of racial injustice, colonization, misogyny and homophobia.” By keeping Ms. Ocasio-Cortez from a prime speaking slot — and dividing the keynote address between 17 young-but-moderate officials — the Biden campaign focused its convention on the political middle, avoiding obvious land mines for the Trump campaign to exploit. Even Mr. Biden’s selection of Ms. Harris as his running mate was an exercise in tapping a successor who can shepherd the party’s next generation without moving it too far left. Ms. Harris, though she briefly endorsed Mr. Sanders’s single-payer health care plans, has a long history as a pragmatist. Democrats certainly hope the combination of Ms. Harris on the ticket and the prime speaking slots given to Barack and Michelle Obama — beloved figures, but also leaders from the past — spurs Black turnout that sagged in battleground states in 2016. But the key to victory may be holding onto gains in the suburbs, where many women and longtime Republican voters are watching the Democratic Party’s older, moderate leaders and envisioning a return to a less chaotic time. — Reid J. Epstein To Krystina François, a Haitian-American executive director of a Miami nonprofit organization, Kamala Harris is a lot like her, a first-generation daughter of immigrants pursuing the American dream. To Nicole Sanchez, a Chicana consultant in Berkeley, Calif., Ms. Harris is an ambitious woman who listened to the same 1990s hip-hop that she did growing up. And to Carol Kim, an Asian-American union organizer in San Diego, Ms. Harris is the first woman on a national stage whom she can point to and say to her daughter, “She is one of us.” In Ms. Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate and California senator, each of the women said they saw someone familiar. And as Ms. Harris, whose parents immigrated from Jamaica and India, reaches the highest echelons of American politics, dozens of women of color said they also view her success as their own. “How could you not see this as a victory?” Afrah Hamin, 66, said of the announcement last week by Joseph R. Biden Jr. that he had chosen Ms. Harris as his running mate. In interviews with dozens of Black, Latina and Asian-American women, many said that in Ms. Harris’s life, they recognized both her triumphs and the challenges that come with living in a country wrestling with its history of discrimination. “It’s the twin devils of racism and sexism,” said Ms. Sanchez, 47, who lives near Ms. Harris’s childhood school. “We are told our whole lives to educate ourselves and work hard — God forbid it actually works, we get told we’re asking for too much.” — Audra D. S. Burch, Jennifer Medina and Evan Nicole Brown Hillary Clinton will return to the Democratic National Convention tonight not as an incumbent seeking a second term, as many Democrats had once hoped and expected, but as a voice warning voters to take nothing for granted if they want to turn President Trump out of office. “For four years, people have said to me, ‘I didn’t realize how dangerous he was,’ ‘I wish I could go back and do it over,’ or worst, ‘I should have voted,’ ” Mrs. Clinton will say, according to a copy of her prepared remarks. “Well, this can’t be another woulda coulda shoulda election.” Mrs. Clinton’s loss to Mr. Trump four years ago, in which she steadily led in the polls during the campaign and won the popular vote by nearly three million votes but lost in the Electoral College, still haunts the party faithful. So Mrs. Clinton, who knows perhaps better than anyone how a series of small events can change the outcome of an election, will urge listeners to vote. “If you vote by mail, request your ballot now, and send it back as soon as you can,” she plans to say. “If you vote in person, do it early. Bring a friend and wear a mask. Become a poll worker. Most of all, no matter what, vote. Vote like our lives and livelihoods are on the line, because they are.” And she will say that Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has been both a rival and an ally in the past, “knows how to heal, unify, and lead.” “I wish Donald Trump had been a better president,” she will say. “But, sadly, he is who he is. America needs a president who shows the same compassion, determination, and leadership in the White House that we see in our communities. Throughout this crisis, Americans have kept going — checking on neighbors, showing up to jobs as first responders and in hospitals, grocery stores, and nursing homes. Because it still takes a village.” — Michael Cooper Updated Aug. 19, 2020 </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
