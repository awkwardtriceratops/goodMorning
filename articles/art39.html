Live Updates: Rebutting Pence, Biden Denounces Dangers of ‘Donald Trump’s America’<br></h1><p id="artcont">RIGHT NOW The pandemic has curbed new voter registrations, but a study suggests a reason for hope. After Pence attacks ‘Joe Biden’s America,’ Biden says the bigger danger is ‘Donald Trump’s America.’ Harris says the Republican convention has one purpose: ‘to soothe Donald Trump’s ego.’ Trump will press his case for another term as a country battered by crises faces two new ones. Deceptive robocalls try to frighten Detroit residents about voting by mail. Here’s how to watch the final night of the Republican convention. Conway says the more violence erupts, ‘the better it is’ for Trump’s re-election prospects. The R.N.C.’s TV ratings declined on the third night, lagging the D.N.C. Joseph R. Biden Jr. responded on Thursday to Vice President Mike Pence’s blunt warning at the Republican National Convention that “you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America” by saying that “the problem we have right now is we are in Donald Trump’s America.” “If you want to talk about safety, the biggest safety issue is people dying from Covid,” Mr. Biden said in an interview on MSNBC, in which he discussed the coronavirus pandemic, the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs and the unrest over policing that has gripped the nation. “More people have died on this president’s watch than at just about any time in American history, on a daily basis,” Mr. Biden said. “And what’s he doing, what’s he doing about it? He continues to flaunt every single basic rule and basic tenet that Democrats and Republicans both have adhered to.” Biden responds to VP Pence's RNC claim that "you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America":

"The problem we have right now is that we're in Donald Trump's America." pic.twitter.com/hD2SSUd7z7 Addressing the unrest in Kenosha, Wis., after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, which Republicans have seized on to try to present themselves as the party of law and order, Mr. Biden condemned violence “in any form” but also said that he supported the right to protest peacefully. And he said that he was troubled by reports that Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old who was arrested in connection with shootings that left two people dead on Tuesday night, may have had “a connection to a militia in Illinois.” “This is not who we are,” Mr. Biden said. “This is not who America is. They want to bring about some order in safety and security for people, we have to start dealing with the real problems underlying all these issues. And the president never speaks to that.” — Michael Cooper WASHINGTON — Senator Kamala Harris said on Thursday that the Republican National Convention was operating in an alternate reality that ignored the coronavirus pandemic and unrest over the repeated police shooting of Black people. “Unlike the Democratic convention, which was very cleareyed about the challenges we are facing and how we can tackle them, the Republican convention is designed for one purpose: to soothe Donald Trump’s ego, to make him feel good,” said Ms. Harris, the Democratic nominee for vice president. “He is the president of the United States and it’s not supposed to be about him. It’s supposed to be about the health and safety and the well-being of the American people. And on that measure, Donald Trump has failed.” The remarks, delivered to about two dozen journalists in an auditorium at George Washington University, appeared to be an attempt to focus public attention on Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, an issue avoided by most of this week’s speakers at the Republican National Convention. Very few convention speakers have addressed the nearly 180,000 Americans who have died from the virus, with discussion of the pandemic instead focusing on how China, where it originated, failed to contain the virus. Ms. Harris, whom aides said would “prosecute the case” against Mr. Trump, said the president has “failed at the most basic and important job” of the presidency. She accused him of being too cozy with the Chinese government, citing his January statement praising the country for its transparency in dealing with the virus. The senator couched her attack on Mr. Trump in the most personal of terms, suggesting he had choked under pressure. (The president has often ridiculed others for weakness under pressure, which he perceives as a fatal character flaw.) “Right at the moment we needed him to be tough on the Chinese government, he caved,” Ms. Harris said. “Instead of rising to meet the most difficult moment of his presidency, Donald Trump froze. He was scared.” Ms. Harris addressed for the first time before television cameras the Sunday police shooting of Jacob Blake, the Black man shot seven times in the back by police in Kenosha, Wis. “It’s sickening to watch, it’s all too familiar and we must end it,” Ms. Harris said. She also condemned people who have convened upon Kenosha with guns, one of whom, an Illinois teenager, was charged with two counts of homicide after shooting into a crowd of protesters Tuesday, killing two people. “We will not let vigilantes in our streets derail the fight for justice,” she said. — Reid J. Epstein A hurricane pounding the Gulf Coast. Another American city lashed by uprisings after the police shooting of a Black man. President Trump has been waiting a long time for tonight — accepting the Republican nomination for a second term as president — but he finds himself competing for attention with the kinds of events that have become too familiar to Americans in recent years. The question is if — or rather how — Mr. Trump will take these unsettling moments into account when he steps outside the White House to deliver his remarks. The new crises are buffeting a nation where life has already been upended by the coronavirus — with the worst outbreak of any wealthy country — and on a day when the Labor Department announced that over a million Americans filed new claims for state jobless benefits last week, in the latest sign that the economy was losing momentum just as extra federal unemployment aid has been pulled away. His vice president, Mike Pence, offered a road map of how to deal with Hurricane Laura in his acceptance speech. He offered prayers for residents in harm’s way and promised that the federal government would help the people of Louisiana recover from any destruction wrought by a storm with winds of up to 150 miles per hour. The situation in Kenosha, Wis., which began after Jacob Blake was left paralyzed after being shot by the police in front of his children, is far more fraught. Wisconsin is not only a swing state; many analysts say that Joseph R. Biden Jr., the president’s Democratic challenger, cannot win in November without taking it back from Mr. Trump. Some polls show him with a lead. It is far from clear how it will play out in the campaign. On one hand, the events — the protest against the police shooting, buildings set on fire, tear gas fired into crowds and Mr. Trump pledging to send in the National Guard — seem to play directly into Republican attacks that Democratic rule would lead to unrest and crime in American cities. But after the worst violence during the protests, a white teenager who confronted protesters was arrested in the fatal shootings of two people. His social media posts suggest he is a strong supporter of Mr. Trump and law enforcement. Despite the tense state of affairs in Wisconsin and questions about the teenager’s political affiliations, Mr. Pence made clear the Trump campaign would not shy away from using the events in Wisconsin to try to make law-and-order attacks on the Democratic ticket. “Let me be clear: The violence must stop — whether in Minneapolis, Portland or Kenosha,” he said. “Too many heroes have died defending our freedoms to see Americans strike each other down. We will have law and order on the streets of America.” — Adam Nagourney and Michael Cooper The authorities in Michigan said on Thursday they were investigating deceptive robocalls targeting Detroit residents in what appeared to be an effort to deter them from voting by mail. In a tweet Thursday morning, Jocelyn Benson, the Michigan secretary of state, called the robocalls, which she said used racially charged stereotypes, an “unconscionable, indefensible, blatant attempt to lie to citizens about their right to vote.” The calls falsely claim that mail-in ballots expose voters to the release of personal information — including to bill collectors. My office has received a recording of a robocall targeting Detroit voters using racially-charged stereotypes and false information to deter voting by mail. It is an unconscionable, indefensible, blatant attempt to lie to citizens about their right to vote. https://t.co/lgNEh8mtvf Voice mail messages left by the robocalls seemed to suggest they were sponsored by Project 1599, describing the group as a “civil rights organization” started by Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. There is a group called Project 1599 started by those two men, conservative Washington political operatives, but it is not a civil rights organization. Mr. Wohl and Mr. Burkman could not immediately be reached for comment. Mr. Wohl, who has a large online following, has in the past helped orchestrate efforts to smear opponents of President Trump. He has made headlines in the past two years for promoting false sexual assault allegations against Robert S. Mueller III, the former special counsel, and Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend mayor and Democratic presidential candidate. A spokeswoman for Ms. Benson’s office said it was not yet clear who was behind the calls, a portion of which were inaudible. The spokeswoman, Tracy Wimmer, said that “everything in that call is completely false.” “Your information is no more exposed than if you simply register to vote,” Ms. Wimmer said, adding that both Ms. Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel of Michigan were beginning an investigation of the calls, which she said appeared to violate federal laws prohibiting voter intimidation. It was not clear how many Detroit residents had received the calls. — Stephanie Saul After eight intense nights of programming, the 2020 conventions will come to an end on Thursday: President Trump will formally accept the Republican nomination, and the general election season will officially begin.

Four more years!” “Joe Biden said that we were living through a ‘season of darkness.’ But as President Trump said, where Joe Biden sees American darkness, we see American greatness. Four years ago, I answered the call to join this ticket, because I knew that Donald Trump had the leadership and the vision to make America great again. And for the last four years, I’ve watched this president endure unrelenting attacks but get up every day and fight to keep the promises that he made to the American people. My fellow Americans, we’re passing through a time of testing, when in the midst of this global pandemic, just as our nation had begun to recover, we’ve seen violence and chaos in the streets of our major cities. President Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest, but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest, tearing down statues is not free speech, and those who do so will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. [applause] So let me be clear: The violence must stop — whether in Minneapolis, Portland or Kenosha. Too many heroes have died defending our freedom to see Americans strike each other down. We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color.” [cheering] “President Trump has stood up for our heroes every day. He stood by our law enforcement, our military and the freedoms we hold dear. He’s made good on his promise to put America first. And I hope you will stand with me as we send him back for four more years, with a clear message to the Democrats: You will never cancel our heroes.” “You may know me as a supporter of President Trump. But tonight I’m here to share with you how he supported me — both as a new mom and as an American with a pre-existing condition. When I was 21 years old, I got a call that changed my life. It was my doctor, informing me that I had tested positive for the BRCA2 genetic mutation, a mutation that put my chances of breast cancer at 84 percent. On May 1, 2018, I followed in my mother’s footsteps, choosing to get a preventative mastectomy. As I came out of anesthesia, one of the first calls I received was from Ivanka Trump. As I recovered, my phone rang again. It was President Trump calling to check on me. I was blown away. Here was the leader of the free world caring about my circumstance.” “I was raised in a household of all women. They were self-reliant and resilient. Their lives were not easy, but they never complained. Money was tight, but we had an abundance of what mattered most: family, faith and freedom. I learned that, in America, limited means does not make for limited dreams. The promise of America belongs to us all.” “I wasn’t born a Trump. I’m from the South. I was raised a Carolina girl. I went to public schools and worked my way through a state university. Mrs. B. from my seventh-grade English class was right. What I learned about our president is different than what you might have heard. I learned that he’s a good man, that he loves his family, that he didn’t need this job. We cannot dare to dream our biggest dreams for ourselves or for our children while consumed by worry about the safety of our families. President Trump is the law-and-order president, from our borders to our backyards.” [music, “Hail to the Chief”] [cheering] The America that many speakers described on Wednesday at the Republican National Convention did not sound like a desirable place: fractious, violent, functionally lawless in some pockets. But their case that only President Trump could shield Americans from this fate was complicated by a nettlesome fact: He is in charge, at present — at the controls of government through the purportedly real-time conditions these supporters outlined. And they would all like to keep him there. “America,” Vice President Mike Pence told a Republican convention crowd sternly from Fort McHenry in Baltimore, “needs four more years of President Donald Trump.” The third night of the Republican convention steered into a bit of messaging jujitsu that has become a dominant theme of the week: Mr. Trump’s capacity to cure the ills that have visited America on his watch but have, in this telling, been largely out of his hands to date. And so Mr. Trump, the argument has gone, can be relied upon now to shield Americans abandoned amid the threats they see all around them, in the nation he leads. “People that can afford to flee have fled,” Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota said of cities like Portland, Ore., and New York. “But the people that can’t — good, hard-working Americans — are left to fend for themselves.” Mr. Pence was more explicit in establishing a contrast with the Democratic nominee: “You won’t be safe,” he said, “in Joe Biden’s America.” Even as president, Mr. Trump has often appeared most comfortable in the role of back-seat driver, jeering his own government like a common bystander, insisting that someone really ought to do something about all this. (“When he has an opinion,” Mr. Pence said, “he is liable to share it.”) — Matt Flegenheimer and Katie Glueck Kellyanne Conway, President Trump’s departing counselor, said on Thursday that Mr. Trump stood to benefit politically from the kind of unrest that erupted this week in Kenosha, Wis., after the police shooting of an unarmed Black man, Jacob Blake. “The more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who’s best on public safety and law and order,” Ms. Conway said on “Fox & Friends.” She had been asked on the program to respond to criticism from the Biden campaign and Pete Buttigieg, the former Democratic presidential candidate, that Mr. Trump was responsible for societal divisions that have been magnified by the protests this summer over police brutality and racial injustice. She told the interviewers she had seen a quote from a Wisconsin restaurant owner to the effect that protesters were actually helping to get Mr. Trump re-elected. Mr. Biden took issue with Ms. Conway’s remarks in an interview on MSNBC Thursday afternoon. “He views this as a political benefit to him,” Mr. Biden said of the president. “You know, he’s rooting for more violence, not less, and is clear about that.” Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to the Biden campaign, condemned Ms. Conway’s comment on a Zoom call with reporters, saying, “Donald Trump has stoked this climate for years because of the sick mentality that she just displayed, thinking it will help him somehow politically.” The political clash came five days into protests over the police shooting in Kenosha, a city of 100,000 people midway between Chicago and Milwaukee. Some of the protests have turned violent, and on Tuesday night two people were shot dead. An Illinois teenager who proclaimed support online for pro-police causes like Blue Lives Matter has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide in connection with the shootings. Ms. Conway, who managed Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and is one of his longest-serving aides, spoke at the Republican National Convention last night. She announced last week that she was stepping down to spend more time with her family. — Neil Vigdor Television ratings declined for Wednesday’s installment of the Republican National Convention, which was seen by roughly 25 percent fewer live viewers than the third night of the Democrats’ convention last week. About 15.7 million people tuned in to watch the convention on television on its third night, when Vice President Mike Pence gave the keynote speech, according to early Nielsen estimates. The decline followed a ratings bump on Tuesday, when 19.4 million watched a Rose Garden address from the first lady, Melania Trump. Fox News, as it has throughout this week, dominated the competition. About 7.1 million people watched Fox News’s convention coverage from 10 to 11:15 p.m., a larger audience than ABC, CBS and NBC combined. No other major network cracked two million viewers during that time period, according to early statistics. Nielsen figures do not include viewers who may have watched the convention on the internet or a streaming platform. Many younger Americans now prefer to watch live events online, but the size of that audience is difficult to credibly measure. — Michael M. Grynbaum Two law professors, including one who served as President George W. Bush’s ethics adviser, have filed a complaint to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel accusing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of violating federal laws by addressing the Republican National Convention while on a diplomatic trip overseas. The complaint, filed on Wednesday, asserts that Mr. Pompeo “abused his office” by taping his nearly four-minute speech from Jerusalem, where he met on Monday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials. The address, which aired on Tuesday night, showed the city’s holy sites over Mr. Pompeo’s shoulder as he praised President Trump’s foreign policy and endorsed his re-election. The complaint said there was no evidence that the Republican Party or the Trump campaign had covered the cost of flying Mr. Pompeo and State Department staff members to Jerusalem on a government jet. “Rather, to the best of our knowledge, the entire cost of the trip was paid for by U.S. taxpayers,” wrote the professors, Claire O. Finkelstein of the University of Pennsylvania and Richard W. Painter of the University of Minnesota, who was Mr. Bush’s chief ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007. The complaint adds: “Transporting a government official to any location to take advantage of a unique setting for a campaign photo or video is itself a misappropriation of government funds and a violation of the Hatch Act,” which bars federal employees from engaging in political activities while on the job. Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas and chairman of a House subcommittee that oversees the State Department, has opened an inquiry into Mr. Pompeo’s appearance. The State Department has said that several lawyers reviewed Mr. Pompeo’s plans to address the political convention and found no legal problem with doing so. Officials also said no department resources were used to film the speech. — Lara Jakes Despite immense interest in November’s elections, new-voter registrations have plummeted this year, thanks to a pandemic that has shut down motor-vehicle licensing offices and get-out-the-vote drives by advocacy groups at places like malls and street festivals. Now, however, a new study suggests registrations are experiencing at least a partial rebound. The study, by the Center for Election Innovation and Research, shows that the total number of new voters registered in June in the District of Columbia and six states — Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Virginia — was slightly above the total logged in June 2016. It marked the end of a steep decline that began in March, when Covid-19 began its rapid spread. That is the good news, said David J. Becker, the director of the center. The bad news is that even with that rebound, those seven jurisdictions have reported nearly 330,000 fewer registrations this year through June than during the same period in 2016. “There’s much more interest in this election than in 2016, and the population has grown,” he said. “So in a normal election we’d expect registration to be significantly higher.” And the trend was spotty even in those seven jurisdictions, which were chosen for the study because new registrations could be separated from address changes and other alterations to the voter rolls. New registrations exceeded the June 2016 level in only four of the seven jurisdictions. — Michael Wines The day after Vice President Mike Pence was the headline speaker at the Republican National Convention, a Wisconsin college announced Thursday that it had decided not to have him deliver its commencement address this weekend. The college, Wisconsin Lutheran College in Milwaukee, said in a statement that “after further review with careful consideration of the escalating events in Kenosha,” it had decided that Mr. Pence should not speak to graduates on Aug. 29. It said that the Rev. Mark Jeske of St. Marcus Lutheran Church had agreed to speak in his place.   After the police shooting of a Black man in Kenosha on Sunday, days of unrest have drawn anti-racism protesters and armed civilians who supported the police, and led to a shooting that killed two people.   Having Mr. Pence come to campus, especially after his law-and-order speech at the convention Wednesday night, could have drawn protests and demonstrations to campus. The college made its announcement after some students and alumni signed an online letter criticizing the administration’s “invitation of a Vice President of an incredibly divisive and controversial ticket to speak in a swing state months before an election.” — Michael Cooper The Biden campaign will spend more than $2 million to air a two-minute ad on national networks and Fox News during coverage of the Republican National Convention tonight. The ad spreads the campaign’s message of resilience and hope for recovery while also getting in a few not-so-subtle digs at President Trump, who is formally accepting his party’s renomination at the convention finale. “When Joe Biden is president, America is just going to have to keep up,” the ad says, after the narrator tweaks those who “take it slow” as a shot of Mr. Trump gingerly ambling down a ramp in West Point plays. “We won’t have to wait to deal with Covid-19: He already has a plan.” Both campaigns have been aggressively seeking to bracket the other’s conventions with paid messaging. Last week, during the Democratic convention, the Trump campaign ran an enormous digital ad operation, monopolizing the top strip of YouTube for a 96-hour stretch and taking over the home pages of The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post for 24 hours at a time. That digital buy, which cost more than $10 million, reached tens of millions of voters. Buying lengthy ad slots has been a campaign tactic for years. Some candidates have even bought full 30-minute slots to run a campaign-produced documentary on broadcast television. But an ad buy of this scale during the final day of a political convention is rare, even in the post-Citizens United, post-public financing world of modern political campaigns. The ad will air on CBS, ABC and NBC nationally, and will also run on Fox News, local Fox affiliates and Fox Sports 1. — Nick Corasaniti Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the nation’s top elected Democrat, said on Thursday that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. should not debate President Trump, telling reporters that she believed her party’s nominee “shouldn’t dignify that conversation with Donald Trump.” “I wouldn’t legitimize a conversation with him, nor a debate,” Ms. Pelosi said at her weekly news conference on Capitol Hill. She acknowledged that the Biden campaign felt differently, but said she considered Mr. Trump’s behavior during the 2016 debates against Hillary Clinton “disgraceful.” “I think that he’ll probably act in a way that is beneath the dignity of the presidency — he does that every day,” she said. “I think he will also belittle what the debates are supposed to be about. They’re not to be about skulduggery on the part of somebody who has no respect for the office he holds, much less the democratic process.” Mr. Biden said on Thursday that not only would he debate Mr. Trump, he would fact-check him. “I’m going to be a fact-checker on the floor while I’m debating him,” Mr. Biden told MSNBC, adding that president had a “somewhat pathological tendency not to tell the truth.” Republicans have pushed to add a fourth debate, suggesting that Mr. Biden, who is 77 and prone to gaffes, could embarrass himself in an unscripted format. They quickly seized Ms. Pelosi’s comment as evidence that leading Democrats, in the words of the Students for Trump leader Ryan Fournier, “don’t want Biden in front of a camera because they know Trump would wipe the floor with him.” Nancy Pelosi just said “I don’t think there should be any debates.”

And there it is folks...

They don’t want Biden in front of a camera because they know Trump would wipe the floor with him. Earlier in the news conference, Ms. Pelosi also implied that House Democrats would continue to pursue Mr. Trump’s elusive tax returns, which he has refused to release in defiance of decades-long norms, even if he loses in November. She made the comments during an endorsement of Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who is fighting for access to Mr. Trump’s returns in the courts and faces a primary challenge next week. “When we win this election and we have a new president of the United States in January and we have a new secretary of the Treasury, and Richie Neal asks for the president’s returns, then the world will see what the president has been hiding all this time,” Ms. Pelosi said. — Nicholas Fandos, Emily Cochrane, Thomas Kaplan and Michael Cooper ST. IGNACE, Mich. — Michigan’s Upper Peninsula is known for many things: its enviable location, nestled among three of the five Great Lakes — Huron, Superior and Michigan; hundreds of waterfalls and vast expanses of lush forests; and the pasty, a dough pocket filled with meat, potatoes and vegetables that served as a portable meal for copper and iron miners. Politically, the U.P. is known for something else: It’s the heart of Trump country in a state that helped propel Mr. Trump to the presidency in 2016, and it’s one of the key battlegrounds in 2020. Just how solid his support remains and whether Democrats can make inroads in his rural strongholds could help determine whether Mr. Trump can win Michigan again. Without the Upper Peninsula, Mr. Trump would have lost Michigan in 2016: He beat Hillary Clinton by nearly 27,000 votes in the region. In the rest of the state, she beat him by more than 16,000 votes. But while the Upper Peninsula may have been solid Trump country four years ago and will probably go for him in 2020, some people in the area think the margins won’t be as large. For starters, the state has trended back toward the Democrats since 2016. Gretchen Whitmer easily won the governor’s race in 2018, by nearly 10 points. She shrunk the margins in the Upper Peninsula considerably, losing the region by 7,073 votes. And people cite a lack of progress on issues affecting the Great Lakes, climate change, the effect of Mr. Trump’s immigration policies on the labor supply for small farmers and, in particular, the failures in combating the pandemic as reasons at least some 2016 Trump voters will not be supporting him this year. Rod Nelson, 65, a lifelong Republican and the retired C.E.O. of the Mackinac Straits Health System, said he’s been “astonished” at the lack of leadership in handling the crisis from Mr. Trump, a man he voted for in 2016, but won’t again in 2020. — Kathleen Gray In contrast to the Democratic convention, where three former presidents and the party’s 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton, made the case for Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Republican convention has been devoid of such standard bearers this week for President Trump. Now dozens of former staff members of the G.O.P.’s previous two presidential nominees — Senator John McCain and Senator Mitt Romney of Utah — have endorsed Mr. Biden. Both have been targets of Mr. Trump — Mr. McCain, who died in 2018, for his role in helping to preserve the Affordable Care Act, and Mr. Romney for voting in support of one of the articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump. The cross-aisle alliance between Mr. McCain and Mr. Biden, one a conservative war hero from Arizona and the other an Irish Catholic senator from Delaware, has been pointed to by Mr. Biden’s supporters as an example of Mr. Biden’s bipartisan spirit. The group of more than 100 former McCain staffers hope that their endorsement amplifies Mr. McCain’s “Country First” credo. That motto and “his frequent call on Americans to serve causes greater than our self-interest were not empty slogans like so much of our politics today,” the group of aides, most of them still Republicans, wrote in a joint statement, praising Mr. McCain and implicitly taking aim at President Trump. “They were the creed by which he lived, and he urged us to do the same.” Mark Salter, Mr. McCain’s longtime chief aide and speechwriter, helped organize the letter. “We have different views of Joe Biden and the Democratic Party platform — most of us will disagree with a fair amount of it — but we all agree that getting Donald Trump out of office is clearly in the national interest,” Mr. Salter said. The list of signers includes a range of people — from chiefs of staff in Mr. McCain’s Senate office to junior aides on his campaigns — who worked for him over his 35 years in Congress and during two presidential bids. Over 30 of Mr. Romney’s former staff members signed a statement repudiating Mr. Trump, which was posted online. “What unites us now is a deep conviction that four more years of a Trump presidency will morally bankrupt this country, irreparably damage our democracy, and permanently transform the Republican Party into a toxic personality cult,” they wrote. “We can’t sit by and allow that to happen.”  — Jonathan Martin and Neil Vigdor It is President Trump’s clearest path to re-election: winning back the suburbs in a handful of swing states that drifted from the Republican Party in the 2018 midterms. And that imperative has been vividly apparent each night of the party’s national convention, with speakers and videos trying to recast Mr. Trump’s divisive record, which hurt Republicans two years ago. There have been glowing tributes from women, scenes of friendly banter between Mr. Trump and immigrants and a Black family, and stories from people he reached out to in their times of despair. The approach amounts to an acknowledgment by the president’s campaign that appealing to his right-wing base will not be enough to win re-election, and that voters who have soured on him after three and a half years are not responding to a strategy that leans heavily into attacking his opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., and other Democrats as radicals and extremists. Trump advisers said on Wednesday that they did not intend to change people’s minds about the president. Voter opinions about him have been remarkably impervious to the good and bad news about him, fluctuating little since he took office. Rather, the aides said, they were seeking to remind suburban voters of policies Mr. Trump has supported — like granting citizenship for legal immigrants and softening harsh criminal statutes — that will give them something to hang on to in the voting booth in November. In 2016, exit polls showed Mr. Trump winning suburban areas 49 percent to 45 percent, helping to offset his deep deficit among city voters. By the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats had caught up: Each party captured 49 percent of votes cast in the suburbs in House races that year, according to exit polls. Now, Mr. Trump’s job approval is worse among suburbanites than even among city dwellers. Sixty-one percent of suburban voters disapproved of his job performance while just 38 percent approved, according to a Fox News poll this month. Among suburban women in particular, Mr. Trump’s net approval rating was only 34 percent. — Jeremy W. Peters, Annie Karni and Nick Corasaniti A boycott by N.B.A. players over the shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wis., elicited a dismissive response from members of the Trump administration on Thursday — one that dramatically diverged from the expressions of solidarity from top Democrats. Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and a senior adviser to the president, suggested during an appearance on the CNBC program “Squawk Box” that the players were not making a significant sacrifice by sitting out of playoff games. “I think that the N.B.A. players are very fortunate that they have the financial position where they’re able to take a night off from work without having to have the consequences to themselves financially,” Mr. Kushner said. “So they have that luxury, which is great.” Mr. Kushner’s comments hit a sour note on social media, with some sports figures and activists noting that Mr. Kushner was not self-made like the N.B.A. players to whom he had referred. Former President Barack Obama commended the players for the boycott. “It’s going to take all our institutions to stand up for our values,” Mr. Obama tweeted on Wednesday after the Milwaukee Bucks refused to leave their locker room for a playoff game. Hillary Clinton tweeted on Thursday that the boycotts by N.B.A. and W.N.B.A. players were an example of the peaceful protests that Representative John Lewis, the civil rights icon who died last month, referred to as “good trouble.” The courage and conviction that athletes of the NBA & WNBA have shown over the last 24 hours is America at its best.

On CNN, Marc Short, Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, called the protests “absurd” and “silly” and said that the N.B.A. and its players had looked the other way on human rights abuses in China. “If they want to protest, I don’t think we care,” Mr. Short said.  — Neil Vigdor Vice President Mike Pence and other Republicans at the R.N.C. on Wednesday portrayed Democrats as tolerant of violence and riots. And they continued to try to soften President Trump’s image.  Learn more about the presidential contenders.
