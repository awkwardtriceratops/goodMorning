Live Updates: Former Homeland Security Official Under Trump Backs Biden, Calling the President’s Actions ‘Terrifying’<br></h1><p id="artcont">Trump says he plans to deliver his acceptance speech at the White House. A former Trump Homeland Security official backs Biden, saying the president was ‘actively doing damage.’ As Democrats gather virtually for their convention, here is their opening night lineup. Biden heads into the convention with a sizable but slightly diminished lead in the polls. Amid fears that postal delays could compromise mail-in voting, the postmaster general will appear before Congress. Michelle Obama, a confident speaker and reticent partisan, will anchor Monday’s program. Cardi B interviews Biden: ‘I just want Trump out.’ Former employees of Bloomberg’s campaign say he shouldn’t speak at the convention. Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security during President Trump’s term, endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for president on Monday, saying what he witnessed the current president do as chief executive “was terrifying.” Mr. Taylor, who made the announcement ahead of the first night of the Democratic National Convention, is the most senior former member of the administration to openly endorse Mr. Biden, and he joins a small number of other officials, including the former national security adviser John Bolton, who have publicly questioned Mr. Trump’s management of the government. In a testimonial video for the group Republicans Voters Against Trump, Mr. Taylor said that each week working there “was terrifying.” He described officials going to the White House to try to discuss a range of national security threats with the president, only to find him disinterested. “The president wanted to exploit the Department of Homeland Security for his own political purposes, and to fuel his own agenda,” Mr. Taylor said in the video. He recalled a phone call related to the California wildfires, during which Mr. Trump told Federal Emergency Management Agency officials to “stop giving money to people whose houses had burned down” because he was so incensed the state hadn’t voted for him. Mr. Taylor said that Mr. Trump also wanted to have a “deliberate policy” of separating children from their parents during illegal border crossings as a deterrent. “A lot of the times the things he wanted to do not only were impossible but in many cases illegal,” Mr. Taylor recalled. “He didn’t want us to tell him it was illegal anymore because he knew that there were — and these were his words — he knew that he had ‘magical authorities.’” “He was one of the most unfocused and undisciplined senior executives I’ve ever encountered,” Mr. Taylor said. “I came away completely convinced based on first-hand experience that the president was ill-equipped and wouldn’t become equipped to do his job effectively, and what’s worse was actively doing damage to our security.” — Maggie Haberman Driven online, like so much of life, by the pandemic, the Democratic National Convention that is getting underway Monday night will not feature the customary cheers, boos and cascading balloon drops of yore — or, its organizers hope, the dropped Zoom calls of today. The event, which is nominally being held in Milwaukee, will be streamed and televised from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern time, will feature Michelle Obama, the former first lady, in a leading role and will offer remarks from an ideologically wide range of speakers who want to turn the page on the Trump era — from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has tried to move the Democratic Party to the left during two runs for president, to several prominent Republicans who will help make the case for Joseph R. Biden Jr. over President Trump. Christine Todd Whitman, a former Republican governor of New Jersey who was later appointed by President George W. Bush to run the Environmental Protection Agency, will speak. So will Meg Whitman, a major Republican fund-raiser and the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, who ran for governor of California in 2010; Susan Molinari, a former Republican congresswoman from New York; and former Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, who sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. “I’m a lifelong Republican, but that attachment holds second place to my responsibility to my country,” Mr. Kasich will say in remarks prepared for delivery. “That’s why I’ve chosen to appear at this convention.” They will add their names to a lineup of prominent Democrats. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan will speak about the coronavirus, which Mr. Trump has failed to get under control. “Only a strong body can fight off the virus, and America’s divisions weakened it,” Mr. Cuomo will say, according to prepared remarks. “Donald Trump didn’t create the initial division. The division created Trump; he only made it worse.” And Ms. Whitmer will praise essential workers — a group she will pointedly say does not include “a president who fights his fellow Americans rather than fight the virus that’s killing us and our economy. For those keeping track at home, here is the lineup for Monday night, as announced by the Democratic National Convention Committee: Introduction: the actress Eva Longoria. Call to order: Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. Featured speakers: Representative Gwen Moore of Wisconsin; Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, D.C.; Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina; Mr. Cuomo; Kristin Urquiza, who lost her father to the coronavirus; Sara Gideon, the speaker of the Maine House of Representatives; Ms. Whitmer; Christine Todd Whitman; Meg Whitman; Ms. Molinari; Mr. Kasich; Senator Doug Jones of Alabama; Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada; Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Mr. Richmond; and Mr. Sanders. Then the main event: Ms. Obama will deliver keynote remarks. The virtual convention format will test the speakers, since politicians accustomed to giving tub-thumping speeches feed off applause and cheers every bit as much as stand-up comedians feed off laughter. Another big unknown is how big an audience — accustomed to past dispatches from correspondents roving the convention floor — will tune in or long on.   — Michael Cooper and Thomas Kaplan New national surveys show that Joseph R. Biden Jr. maintains a significant if slightly diminished lead over President Trump, leaving him in a stronger position to oust an incumbent president than any challenger heading into his party’s convention in the modern polling era. On average, Mr. Biden leads by eight to nine percentage points among likely voters. His advantage is perhaps slightly smaller than it was a month ago, when high-quality live-interview telephone surveys routinely showed him with a double-digit lead. But it is still the largest and most persistent national polling lead that any candidate has held in 24 years, since Bill Clinton maintained a double-digit advantage as an incumbent in 1996. The conventions often introduce a volatile and uncertain period for public polling, as candidates usually gain in the polls after several days in the limelight on national television. Though the virtual nature of this year’s conventions could dampen that effect, this may be the last unbiased measurement of the state of the race until mid-September. For now, the state of the race is clear, ending a nearly two-month period when live-interview and online polls showed a modestly different race. The new consensus can mainly be attributed to a shift among live-interview telephone surveys, which show a modest two-point shift in Mr. Trump’s direction. The online polls have remained largely unchanged. It is too soon to evaluate what effect Mr. Biden’s selection of Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate might have. So far, there are no early signs that she has revitalized his standing among nonwhite voters. The only two telephone surveys conducted entirely after her selection, from CNN/SSRS and ABC News/Washington Post, show Mr. Biden faring somewhat worse among nonwhite voters than in their prior surveys from June or July. — Nate Cohn With the Postal Service and the Trump administration under fire for mail delays that threaten to compromise a pandemic-era election in which millions of people plan to vote by mail, officials announced Monday that the postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, would testify before a House oversight committee next week. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said Monday that Mr. DeJoy would appear in front of the panel on Aug. 24. “The American people want their mail, medicines, and mail-in ballots delivered in a timely way, and they certainly do not want drastic changes and delays in the midst of a global pandemic just months before the election,” she said in a statement. Her announcement came as two Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee urged the F.B.I. to open a criminal investigation into actions by Mr. DeJoy and the Postal Service’s Board of Governors that may have caused mail delays. “Multiple media investigations show that Postmaster DeJoy and the Board of Governors have retarded the passage of mail,” Representatives Ted W. Lieu of California and Hakeem Jeffries of New York, wrote in a letter to the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray. “If their intent in doing so was to affect mail-in balloting or was motivated by personal financial reasons, then they likely committed crimes.” The letter was first reported by MSNBC. The Postal Service did not respond to a request for comment. Elsewhere on the postal front: Mail-in voters from six states filed a lawsuit Monday against Mr. Trump and Mr. DeJoy, seeking to block cuts to the Postal Service ahead of the election. The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan on behalf of 17 plaintiffs from California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, New Jersey, Wisconsin and New York, asks the court to declare that Mr. Trump and Mr. DeJoy have violated voters’ rights by cutting the Postal Service in an effort to stymie mail-in voting. Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly made baseless claims that voting by mail is riddled with fraud, even as he recently requested his own vote-by-mail ballot in Florida, said on “Fox & Friends” Monday that Democrats were using postal funding as leverage for getting additional spending in the stalled coronavirus relief package Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, the majority leader, pushed back on Monday on concerns that the Postal Service would not be able to handle as many as 80 million ballots come November, telling reporters in his home state that “the Postal Service is going to be just fine” and that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had already signaled a willingness to spend more on it. The House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said Sunday that she would call the House back from its annual summer recess almost a month early to vote this week on legislation to block changes at the Postal Service. — Neil Vigdor, Emily Cochrane, Catie Edmondson, Michael D. Shear, Luke Broadwater and Michael Cooper Back in 2012, President Barack Obama’s advisers routinely referred to Michelle Obama as “the most popular” political figure in the country — and many thought her rousing and resonant speech at the Democratic convention in Charlotte that year was the apex of that very non-virtual event. Eight years later, aides to Joseph R. Biden Jr. (many of them former Obama White House hands) feel pretty much the same way about a woman whose wildly successful memoir, “Becoming,” transformed the one-time corporate lawyer into an international cultural icon. That is why they chose Ms. Obama to anchor the first night of the first-ever Zoom convention, a prime-time keynote that is expected to garner as much attention among the party faithful as any on the four-night bill, apart from the speeches by her husband and Mr. Biden. “It is a no-brainer to have her go on the first night,” said Jennifer Palmieri, a top adviser to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign who wrote a book about women in politics. “She’s the most admired woman in America, and the only political figure with a significant reach beyond politics.” In a short excerpt from the speech provided by the Democratic National Committee, Ms. Obama praised Mr. Biden as a “profoundly decent man” and contrasted him with his opponent, saying the former vice president “will tell the truth” and “will govern as someone who has lived a life that the rest of us can recognize.” Mrs. Obama’s speech, which will air in the 10 p.m. hour, has been in the can for at least a week, according to people close to the situation. The speech was pre-recorded because event planners did not want to risk running it live in anticipation of opening-night technical glitches. Mrs. Obama has told friends she views the speech as her major contribution to the 2020 race, working on it with a team that included her longtime speechwriter, Sarah Hurwitz, a person close to the process said. She will discuss the personal tragedies that have defined Mr. Biden’s life, said Mrs. Obama’s friend and adviser Valerie Jarrett. “He is able to feel other people’s pain,” Ms. Jarrett said in an interview. “That is a contrast between Joe and the current president.” The former first lady is a confident but reticent performer who prefers to be more politics-adjacent than overtly partisan. She has dismissed, emphatically, any suggestion she parlay her popularity into a run for office. (Still, a poll in May showed two-thirds of Democrats wanted her to be Mr. Biden’s running mate.) The tone of the speech is likely to be in line with her recent focus on voter participation, and it will be sure to reflect her 2016 tag line, “when they go low, we go high.” In an interview last July, Ms. Obama, 56, spoke bluntly about the strains of attending President Trump’s inauguration and having to make small talk with Melania Trump, the first lady, who was accused of cribbing parts of her 2016 Republican convention speech in Cleveland from Ms. Obama’s introduction of her husband at the 2008 Democratic convention in Denver. “And then we had to meet the Trumps,” she told her friend Gayle King during an onstage discussion in New Orleans. “That day was very emotional, and then to sit at that inauguration and to look around at a crowd that was not reflective of the country.” — Glenn Thrush Cardi B, the Bronx-raised rapper known for hot summer songs and even hotter takes, remains a critical voice in politics, particularly for millennial and Gen-Z voters. She has leveraged her platform and her nearly 73 million Instagram followers to educate her young and diverse fan base on a range of issues, including the importance of getting out the vote. Her talent as a delightfully straightforward and relatable political commentator has been evident since she began supporting Senator Bernie Sanders during his first presidential run in 2016. (The two have since been known to FaceTime about everything from parenting to Social Security.) In April, just after Mr. Sanders dropped out of the 2020 race, Cardi B interviewed him on Instagram and asked him why he had decided to endorse Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., especially given the gulf that exists between the two men’s policies. She has since endorsed Mr. Biden — who she has repeatedly described as “conservative” — and she was one of the chorus of voices who called on him to select a Black woman as his running mate. In an Elle interview published on Monday, Cardi B spoke with Mr. Biden over Zoom about her hopes for how he would handle the coronavirus pandemic, student loan debt, racial inequality and health care if elected. The steady undercurrent beneath the discussion was a shared interest in replacing President Trump. “I have a whole list of things that I want our next president to do for us,” she said. “But first, I just want Trump out. His mouth gets us in trouble so much. I don’t want to be lied to — we’re dealing with a pandemic right now, and I just want answers.” Cardi B used her own lived experience to formulate questions for Mr. Biden that urged him to define his policies and how they’ll be implemented; the tactic left little room for theoretical filler. In response to her lament that Mr. Trump’s mercurial attitude toward the coronavirus had been confusing to the American public, Biden emphasized the importance of voting to replace him. “In 2016, if 18- to 24-year-olds had voted in the same percentage as the rest of the population, there would have been 5.2 million more votes,” he said. “We would have had Hillary Clinton.” “Your generation can own what happens in the next election,” he added. “They can change things dramatically if they show up and vote.” — Evan Nicole Brown President Trump confirmed Monday that he will deliver his own nomination acceptance speech next week at the White House, telling a small crowd in Wisconsin that he will “have plenty to say” as he formally becomes the Republican candidate for his re-election. The president had said he might deliver the speech at the Civil War battlefield in Gettysburg, Pa., after the surging coronavirus pandemic made it impossible to hold the in-person convention that he had hoped for. Mr. Trump had tried to move the event to Florida after officials in North Carolina, where it was originally scheduled, made it clear that they would insist on following health measures. White House officials had been signaling for days that it was likely that the president’s re-election campaign would choose 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue for the speech, over the objections of ethics experts who said it would politicize the nation’s most famous house. In a campaign speech in Oshkosh, Wis., on Monday, Mr. Trump said he would be making the speech “live from the White House.” The Republican National Committee plans to hold a fireworks display at the Washington Monument after Mr. Trump accepts his party’s nomination on Aug. 27, a move ethics experts have criticized as a blatantly political ploy by Republicans, who have supported hosting convention events on national park land. Mr. Trump’s critics have said that using federal property as the backdrop for what will be one of the president’s peak political moments would amount to a serious violation of the often hazy line between candidate and public servant. The president is not subject to the Hatch Act, a law that prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activities while on the job. But everyone who works for him is. White House officials have pledged to comply with the law. According to documents filed with the National Park Service and obtained by The New York Times, the Republican National Committee has applied to conduct a five-minute fireworks display that night beginning at 11:30 p.m. The committee also filed a separate request to film portions of the Nation Mall, most likely for promotional materials, an official familiar with the plans said. Mike Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said in an email that the permit for the fireworks was still being processed and that no decision had been made yet. “It’s bad, and it’s even worse that it’s happening in conjunction with another national park, the White House lawn,” said Norman L. Eisen, who served as President Barack Obama’s ethics counsel. Standing in front of Air Force One on the tarmac of the Minneapolis airport Monday afternoon, President Trump assailed Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris, accusing them of wanting to bring a “left-wing war on cops” to the White House. In his first stop in Minneapolis since the protests and violence that struck the city after the police killing of George Floyd, Mr. Trump lashed out at what he called “radical left anarchists” who looted parts of the city. It was part of a series of trips meant to serve as counter-programming to the Democratic convention. On Tuesday, the president is expected to make a stop in Iowa and give a speech on border security in Yuma, Ariz. On Thursday, the day Mr. Biden is scheduled to formally accept his party’s nomination, Mr. Trump plans to deliver remarks in Old Forge, Pa., not far from Mr. Biden’s hometown, Scranton.  — Michael D. Shear and Katie Rogers Former staff members of the presidential campaign of Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor whose failed billion-dollar bid for the White House lasted just over three months, have called for him to be removed from the Democrats’ convention program. Hours after their demand was made public, a source close to Mr. Bloomberg said the party-hopping billionaire planned to donate $60 million to House Democrats, about the same amount he shelled out in 2018. The debate over Mr. Bloomberg’s presence on the program illustrates the unique challenges faced by a party seeking to fuse together a disparate coalition of progressives, unions and monied moderates like the former mayor. Six former employees, who are among those who have sued Mr. Bloomberg for wrongful termination, released an open letter on Monday to the Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez asking him to cancel Mr. Bloomberg’s remarks “and replace him with a Democratic politician or labor leader who supports workers’ rights and other core Democratic Party values.” They also asked Mr. Perez, whose organization received an $18 million transfer from Mr. Bloomberg in March, for their jobs back and the opportunity to work in the field for Joseph R. Biden Jr. The letter was signed by people who had worked as field organizers for Mr. Bloomberg in Georgia, Utah and Washington State and are involved in one of several lawsuits against Mr. Bloomberg relating to the terms under which they were let go when he dropped out of the race in March. In the suit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan last spring, the former staff members alleged that Mr. Bloomberg had tricked them into taking jobs that they expected to last through the election — regardless of who won the Democratic nomination. The workers summarized their grievances anew in the letter to Mr. Perez on Monday, noting that thousands like them had been abruptly terminated in the midst of the pandemic. “This is the type of greedy, anti-worker move we’d expect from Donald Trump, but not from a Democratic presidential candidate,” they wrote. A spokeswoman for Mr. Bloomberg disputed the former employees’ claims on Monday. “Like every campaign that ends, people were let go. Unlike other campaigns however, Mike Bloomberg gave his staff health insurance through November as well as severance,” the spokeswoman wrote in an email, calling Mr. Bloomberg “the biggest supporter of the Democratic Party.” Mr. Bloomberg also responded monetarily: He plans to fund broadcast and digital ads to help protect the seats of Democratic moderates elected two years ago, a person close to him said. The donation was first reported by the Washington Post. The former staffers named a dozen other public figures, including politicians like Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and labor leaders like AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, whom they argued ought to take Mr. Bloomberg’s spot. “All of these people are far better suited to credibly and powerfully speak about the values that we hold dear as Democrats and the things Democrats want to accomplish to make our economy work for working families again,” they wrote, “instead of further rigging the system for billionaires like Mike Bloomberg to make even more profit.” — Rebecca R. Ruiz and Glenn Thrush Some of the tensions inherent in the Democrats’ big-tent approach to their convention broke into view Monday in a revealing back-and-forth between two very different politicians who will speak on behalf of Joseph R. Biden Jr.: John R. Kasich, a Republican who served as governor of Ohio and ran for president in 2016, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a rising Democratic star who is a favorite of the progressive left. Mr. Kasich said in an interview with BuzzFeed News that he sees the nation as fundamentally moderate and questioned whether Ms. Ocasio-Cortez should be seen as representing the Democratic Party. “People on the extreme, whether they’re on the left or on the right, they get outsized publicity that tends to define their party,” Mr. Kasich said in the interview. “You know, I listen to people all the time make these statements, and because AOC gets outsized publicity doesn’t mean she represents the Democratic Party. She’s just a part, just some member of it. And it’s on both sides, whether it’s the Republicans or whether it’s the Democrats.” It’s great that Kasich has woken up &realized the importance of supporting a Biden-Harris ticket. I hope he gets through to GOP voters.

Yet also, something tells me a Republican who fights against women’s rights doesn’t get to say who is or isn’t representative of the Dem party. https://t.co/38h6JGpbMj Ms. Ocasio-Cortez responded on Twitter, writing: “It’s great that Kasich has woken up & realized the importance of supporting a Biden-Harris ticket. I hope he gets through to GOP voters. Yet also, something tells me a Republican who fights against women’s rights doesn’t get to say who is or isn’t representative of the Dem party.” — Michael Cooper A political convention is traditionally the work of thousands — event planners, camera operators, stage managers, even an inflation team for the ceremonial balloon drop on the nominee. But with the coronavirus sequestering delegates to living rooms and reducing the raucous arena to a pixelated party of (very roughly) like-minded politicos, the most critical staff members for this year’s nearly all-virtual convention are the ones who often operate behind the scenes, away from the stage, in front of small screens: The digital team. For the Democratic National Convention, their work has meant building a network capable of expanding from a dozen or so remote feeds to hundreds; ensuring a livestream has enough redundancy to offset any lags or other problems and constructing a broadcast to recreate some semblance of a reactive audience. It’s also involved organizing a coaching team for speakers and participants to mitigate, as much as possible, any embarrassing Zoom-mutes or microphone mishaps. — Nick Corasaniti This was supposed to be a banner moment for Democrats in Wisconsin, a chance to put out the welcome mat for thousands of delegates and gush about “America’s Dairyland.” But party stalwarts in the state, which could be a linchpin in the November election, were relegated to the role of virtual hosts on Monday as the Democratic National Convention got underway. The head of the Wisconsin Democrats said that if it wasn’t for President Trump’s failure in handling the coronavirus pandemic, delegates would have been able to gather in Milwaukee for an in-person convention. The party chairman, Ben Wikler, criticized the Trump administration’s response to the health crisis during a welcome breakfast held online on the convention’s opening day. Milwaukee’s mayor, Tom Barrett, commiserated with the other party leaders about losing out on an in-person convention. “We have been dealt a rough set of cards,” Mr. Barrett said. Gov. Tony Evers, who has clashed with conservatives over emergency orders during the pandemic, said that Republicans had put power and politics ahead of public health. “The pandemic has laid bare the hard truths around our country,” Mr. Evers said. “Joe Biden understands what it takes to lead a country in crisis.” Senator Tammy Baldwin said that Mr. Trump, his son Eric Trump, and Vice President Mike Pence were putting the public at risk by planning upcoming campaign events in Wisconsin. “They’re unsafe because they’re holding in-person events,” Ms. Baldwin said. “The mismanagement and total utter failure of leadership during the pandemic is laid out starkly.”  — Neil Vigdor It wouldn’t be the Democratic National Convention without some Hollywood star power, and this year is no exception, even though the proceedings will be largely virtual. The actresses Eva Longoria, Tracee Ellis Ross, Kerry Washington and Julia Louis-Dreyfus will serve as M.C.s during the four nights of the convention, organizers announced on Monday. “The voices we’re including are the perfect messengers to lift up our theme of unity and help us engage with more Americans than ever before,” Stephanie Cutter, the convention’s program director, said in a statement. It was not immediately clear whether the M.C.s would make live or prerecorded appearances, or how much speaking time they would have. The organizers said only that the hosts would “keep the program moving and connected.” Ms. Longoria, 45, a Mexican-American TV star known for her role on “Desperate Housewives,” will be the convention’s Monday night M.C. She has sought to increase Latino representation in government and was a founder of the group Latino Victory Project and spoke at the 2016 Democratic convention, where she criticized Donald J. Trump’s comments about Central American immigrants. “My father isn’t a criminal or a rapist,” she said then. “In fact, he’s a veteran.” Ms. Ross, 47, who has won a Golden Globe Award for her role on “black-ish” and  moderated a book tour for the former first lady Michelle Obama in 2018, will be the M.C. on Tuesday. Ms. Washington, 43, who starred on the ABC television series “Scandal,” will handle hosting duties on Wednesday night. This convention will culminate with Ms. Louis-Dreyfus taking over the M.C. role on Thursday, the night of Mr. Biden’s nomination acceptance speech. Ms. Louis-Dreyfus, 59, was Elaine on “Seinfeld” and played the fictional vice president Selina Meyer on the HBO series “Veep.” In 2017, when Ms. Louis-Dreyfus disclosed that she had breast cancer, Mr. Biden tweeted his support for her, writing, “We Veeps stick together. Jill and I, and all of the Bidens, are with you, Julia.” We Veeps stick together. Jill and I, and all of the Bidens, are with you, Julia. pic.twitter.com/JP0c2wtrJ6 — Neil Vigdor and Reid J. Epstein In the months since Senator Bernie Sanders ended his campaign for president, progressive candidates have notched once-improbable primary victories against longtime Democratic incumbents. Each member of the so-called Squad, the group of progressive women of color in the House, will almost certainly return to Washington. The coronavirus pandemic has revitalized support nationwide for progressive policy proposals including “Medicare for all.” In that time, Mr. Sanders has quietly faded back into Senate life. Aside from endorsing some fellow progressives down the ballot, he has largely kept his focus on the public health crisis. One of his latest initiatives was to introduce legislation that would provide “masks for all.” On Monday, Mr. Sanders will address the Democratic National Convention and once again make his case for the progressive cause. Once again, he will deliver a speech as a losing candidate to rally his loyal followers behind another nominee. But this is not 2016. While Mr. Sanders nominally lent his support to Hillary Clinton at this point four years ago, he never stopped arguing that he had been mistreated in the primary — that the election was rigged and the entire political system was, too — an air of grievance that his followers took with them to the convention floor. That 2016 gathering was overshadowed by hacked emails from D.N.C. accounts showing party officials eager to help Mrs. Clinton and undercut Mr. Sanders — a revelation that left the party’s Clinton and Sanders wings deeply divided and confirmed the longstanding complaints of bias from the Vermont senator. Mr. Sanders is still stubborn, still passionate and still convinced he would have made the best president. But this year, he also appears to be something else: at peace. — Sydney Ember Updated Aug. 17, 2020 </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
