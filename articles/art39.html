Trump, mocking Harris’s laugh, says he wants to stop her from becoming ‘the first woman president.’ How Georgia, once reliably Republican, has become an improbable battleground. Justice Clarence Thomas will give the oath to Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a White House official said. Trump holds a slim edge in Texas but faces big suburban losses, a New York Times/Siena College poll finds. House freshmen from swing districts are poised to help Democrats keep control. Trump walked out on Lesley Stahl on ‘60 Minutes,’ and a huge audience tuned in. Biden targets older voters with an ad claiming that Trump poses a threat to Social Security. The Senate was poised on Monday to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative appeals court judge and protégé of former Justice Antonin Scalia, to the Supreme Court, handing President Trump a coveted achievement just eight days before the election. Sharply divided along party lines, senators debated through the night Sunday into Monday and were expected to fight right up to 7:30 p.m. when the vote is scheduled to take place. All but one Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, planned to vote in favor of Judge Barrett. Democrats are united in opposition, as much for policy reasons as the decision to fill the seat at all so close to an election. Republicans outright refused to do so in 2016 when a vacancy opened under a Democratic president because, they argued, voters should have a say. A jubilant White House planned to hold a swearing in event shortly after the vote Monday night to try to give a boost to the president’s flagging re-election campaign. It was a remarkable choice after a similar, albeit larger, event announcing the nominee one month ago to the day turned into a coronavirus superspreader event. And it underscored just how thoroughly election politics had buffeted the nomination. Republicans had profound reasons to celebrate. Judge Barrett, 48, was Mr. Trump’s third nominee to the Supreme Court, but spread out beneath her are 162 new district court judges and 53 appeals court judges, roughly a third of the entire federal appellate bench. Together, they could alter the nation long after Mr. Trump leaves office, putting a conservative imprint on everything from the right to an abortion, same-sex marriage and the vote, to corporate power and the ability of government to regulate the environment. Judge Barrett’s impact on the court may be felt uncommonly quickly once she is confirmed. There are three major election disputes awaiting immediate action by the Supreme Court from the battleground states of Wisconsin, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Each concerns the date by which absentee ballots may be accepted. Then in November, she will begin hearing cases on the Affordable Care Act, the rights of same-sex couples, Mr. Trump’s immigration plans and, potentially, any legal challenges arising out of the election results. Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah and the party’s 2012 presidential nominee, said Judge Barrett’s confirmation was vital to maintaining public trust in one of the few American institutions that still enjoys any. “She is a woman of unquestionable character and integrity, the presence of which is essential to our nation as the confidence of the Court itself is in balance,” he said in a speech on the Senate floor. “I will be honored to vote to confirm her nomination.” The vote comes a day after Democrats unsuccessfully tried to filibuster the nomination to protest a decision they say should be left to the winner of the presidential election. Their anger rose, and with it grew suggestions from Democrats that they would take dramatic measures, such as adding additional justices to the court, if they reclaimed the Senate and the presidency. “They expect that they’re going to be able to break the rules with impunity and when the shoe maybe is on the other foot, nothing’s going to happen,” Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who votes with Democrats, said of the Republicans. Republican leaders argue there is no inconsistency: now, unlike in 2016, the same party controls both the White House and the Senate. Democrats argue the addition of Judge Barrett to the court would threaten legal abortion and protections for millions of Americans under the Affordable Care Act. “A vote for Barrett is a vote to strip health care from millions of people. It’s a vote to turn back the clock on reproductive freedom,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. “To endanger Dreamers and immigrants. To let climate change rampage unchecked. To imperil efforts to address systemic racism. To place workers’ rights, voting rights, L.G.B.T.Q. rights, and gun violence prevention at risk.” Republicans, frustrated by their belief that Judge Barrett’s qualifications had gotten short shrift for weeks, touted her as an icon in the making for conservative women and a judge who would do right by the country. “In a less political time than we find ourselves today,” Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina lamented, “I suspect she would have the unanimous support of this body.” — Nicholas Fandos  Joseph R. Biden Jr. said he would travel to Iowa and Georgia in the last week before Election Day, in a sign that the campaign is significantly expanding its electoral map with only eight days left in the presidential race. “I’m going to be going to Iowa, I’m going to Wisconsin, I’m going to Georgia, I’m going to Florida and maybe other places as well,” Mr. Biden said during a stop at a voting center in Chester, Pa., not far from his home in Delaware. Mr. Biden also said he thought he would win Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota, three critical battleground states that could be his key to victory. “I am not overconfident about anything,” Mr. Biden said. But that he will spend part of his remaining time on the campaign trail in Iowa and Georgia, two states that had seemed unattainable for Democrats at the beginning of the presidential cycle, suggests that the Biden campaign feels it is in a position of strength heading into the final stretch against President Trump. It is not unheard-of for campaigns to make last-minute feints into long-shot states, sometimes to force their opponents to spend more resources there and sometime to help Senate or House candidates. But polling has suggested that Mr. Biden is competitive in both Iowa and Georgia. An average of current state polls shows Mr. Biden with a narrow edge of three percentage points in Iowa, according to the Upshot’s calculator, and roughly tied in Georgia. The move most likely will prompt questions about whether his campaign is overly confident in Mr. Biden’s electoral prospects in crucial battlegrounds like Michigan and Pennsylvania, two states that Mr. Trump narrowly won in 2016 but where Mr. Biden currently leads in most polls. Moments after Mr. Biden spoke, his campaign provided more details about his travel schedule, indicating he would travel to Iowa and Wisconsin on Friday. — Sydney Ember TRANSCRIPT “And ‘Sleepy Joe Biden’ has pledged the biggest tax hike in history. Did anybody see ‘60 Minutes’ last night? Did anybody see ‘60 Minutes’ — which is a total joke of a show. But you saw I released the thing early so they got the full — but it was OK — but did you see his performance on that show? The only thing almost as bad was Kamala with the laugh. ‘Haha, that’s so funny, haha.’ She kept laughing. I said, is there something wrong with her too? [crowd laughing] She will not be the first woman president, you can’t let that happen. But how about this — Mike was great — but how about this: They asked me, she says, ‘Are you ready for tough questions?’ I thought she was kidding, you know, because how do you — I said, ‘Just treat me fairly.’ ‘No, no, no. This is tough questions.’” Crowd member: “They hate you.” “And I — they do. And I said, ‘Let’s see what you have.’ And it was just question, question, kill. Always going for the kill.” President Trump ripped into Senator Kamala Harris in demeaning and personal terms during a rally in Pennsylvania on Monday, saying, “She will not be the first woman president — you can’t let that happen” while mocking the way she laughed during her “60 Minutes” interview on Sunday. During a high-decibel, scattershot speech in Allentown that lasted well over an hour, Mr. Trump repeatedly targeted Ms. Harris — who is running for vice president, not president — in a heckling performance that mirrored his attacks on Hillary Clinton and other female foils over the years. The president went on to offer caustic negative appraisals of other prominent women he said had treated him badly — the CBS correspondent Lesley Stahl, NBC’s Savannah Guthrie and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Moments later, he trumpeted his appeal to “suburban women,” despite polls showing him trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr. among suburban women in battleground states by more than 20 percentage points. “She will not be the first woman president. You can’t let that happen. You can’t let that happen,” Mr. Trump said of Ms. Harris, during the first of three scheduled rallies in the battleground state on Monday. He did not explain what he meant by the comment: In the past he has claimed, without evidence, that Ms. Harris, a California Democrat, would be a de facto president if elected. At a rally in Florida last week, Mr. Trump also attacked Ms. Harris with a gratuitous reference to her gender, saying the country did not need a socialist president — “especially a female socialist president.” “Did anybody see ‘60 Minutes’ last night? Did anybody see it?” said Mr. Trump, who stormed out of his own interview with Ms. Stahl, accusing her of asking tough questions while her program lobbed softballs to Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris. “It was a total joke of a show,” he added. “Did you see his performance on that show? The only thing almost as bad was Kamala with the laugh, oh, that’s so funny. She kept laughing. I said, ‘Is there something wrong with her, too?’” He also criticized Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee: “The watermelon head, right?” Mr. Trump was barnstorming his way through Pennsylvania Monday, with three rallies  scheduled. Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were both on the campaign trail, despite the fact that Mr. Trump had the coronavirus earlier this month and there is currently an outbreak in the vice president’s office. At an afternoon rally in  Lititz, Pa., the president mocked Mr. Biden for his sparse travel schedule, saying that if he loses, “he should be ashamed of himself because he didn’t work.” On Friday officials in Pennsylvania reported 2,258 new coronavirus cases, a one-day record for the state, according to a New York Times database. Mr. Trump, who faces a widening gender gap, nonetheless defended his standing among women voters — in part, by making a racist appeal based on his opposition to an Obama-era program intended to integrate segregated suburbs. “I think I’m doing great with suburban women. I am saving the suburbs! I am saving the suburbs. How can I do badly?” he said to wild applause, from the crowd arranged on risers outside an Allentown factory, many of them not wearing masks. “Here is what I know about suburban women,” he added. “First of all, they are great. Love our country. They want to do things. They want to leave their house alone. They don’t want the five-story project next to them or could be higher. They want to leave their house alone. They want security. OK?” After the cheering died away, Mr. Trump asked the audience, “Am I that bad? Am I that bad?” — to shouts of ‘no!” Mr. Trump also repeated falsehoods about the ballot-counting process in Pennsylvania and expressed solidarity with groups of supporters who have been showing up at polling sites to videotape people attempting to vote, a practice the state’s attorney general has called voter intimidation. “We’re watching you very closely, Philadelphia,” he said. — Glenn Thrush Georgia, a Republican stronghold for nearly two decades, is growing fast and changing in profound ways that are giving Democrats big hopes for 2020. With only a week left before the Nov. 3 election, polls show President Trump, who won Georgia by five points in 2016, locked in a virtual tie with his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., who plans to visit the state on Tuesday. At the same time, two well-funded Democratic candidates, Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, are running competitive races for the state’s two Senate seats. Representative Lucy McBath, a Democrat, is favored to win re-election to her suburban Atlanta House seat against Karen Handel, whom she beat in 2018. The suburban Atlanta House seat of a retiring Republican is expected to flip to the Democrats. Some Democrats even dream of capturing the state House. All this is happening in a diverse state whose new politics are defined by young voters, suburban women alienated by Mr. Trump, and minorities energized by the Democrat Stacey Abrams and her near-miss bid in 2018 to become the country’s first African-American woman governor. Georgia Democrats — stung in the past by premature talk of a realignment of the state’s politics — are careful to temper their optimism. The Republican Party remains well-organized, popular and powerful here. Republicans hold every elected statewide office, control both chambers of the state Legislature, still command a majority among college-educated white voters, and maintain a dominance in rural counties. Jason Carter, the grandson of President Jimmy Carter and a Democrat who was soundly defeated in the 2014 race for governor, joked, “Frankly, I think it would be impossible for Trump to win — and I haven’t been this confident since 2016,” when Hillary Clinton’s campaign dared to dream of a Georgia victory. Yet there is a bipartisan consensus that the state is not exactly what it was, even just a few years ago. Its population surged from 7.9 million to 10.6 million people from 2000 to 2019, and its foreign-born population now exceeds 10 percent. While Republicans remain formidable in rural areas, an accurate portrait of 21st Century Georgia would have to include not only peach and peanut farms, but also Your DeKalb Farmers Market, a global culinary bazaar in the Atlanta suburbs staffed by workers from 40 countries that attracts both immigrants and native-born bourgeois bohemians. — Richard Fausset Justice Clarence Thomas will give the constitutional oath to Judge Amy Coney Barrett at the White House on Monday night after she is officially confirmed to the Supreme Court by the Senate, a White House official said. There is expected to be a ceremony honoring Ms. Barrett after the vote, but Mr. Thomas will administer the official oath to her as she assumes her new role, the official said. The possibility of a ceremony for Ms. Barrett is the type of event that President Trump has enjoyed hosting at the White House. But the prospect of an event with dozens of people has already raised questions, given that an outdoor event in her honor held on Sept. 26 has been associated with an outbreak of the coronavirus that impacted President Trump, the first lady, and a half-dozen aides and advisers. It also comes at a time when Ms. Barrett could end up hearing cases related to the 2020 election. — Maggie Haberman If Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court today as expected, she will almost immediately confront a host of issues concerning the election and the policies of President Trump, who placed her on the court. Here are some answers to frequently asked questions. When can she start? As soon as she is sworn in, meaning she could be at work on Tuesday. Under the court’s usual practices, she cannot participate in cases that have already been argued. Should the court deadlock in some of those cases, though, the court can set them down for re-argument before the full court. Must she recuse herself from cases involving President Trump? The Supreme Court allows justices to decide whether to disqualify themselves. In the past, justices have not hesitated to sit on cases involving the presidents who appointed them. Are there election disputes awaiting decisions? Yes. The court will soon act on cases from North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all concerning whether deadlines for receiving mailed ballots may be extended. Two of them are emergency applications, which are decided without arguments. The third is a request to hear the case on the merits, but on a very fast schedule. When is she likely to hear her first arguments? Next Monday, when the court returns to the virtual bench for a two-week sitting to hear arguments by telephone. In the coming months, the Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on the fate of the Affordable Care Act, on two major Trump administration immigration policies, on whether Mr. Trump can exclude undocumented immigrants from the reapportionment of congressional seats and on whether religious groups must comply with government policies barring discrimination against same-sex couples. — Adam Liptak President Trump maintains a narrow edge in Texas, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll on Monday, as he faces a rebellion in the state’s once overwhelmingly Republican suburbs. Mr. Trump leads Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Texas by 47 percent to 43 percent among likely voters, the survey found, which is within the poll’s margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The survey of 802 likely voters was mostly conducted before the final presidential debate on Thursday. In the Senate race, the Republican incumbent, John Cornyn, holds a larger lead, 48-38, over the Democrat, M.J. Hegar. Polls have shown a competitive race in Texas all cycle, but the Biden campaign has made only limited efforts to contest the state. The Republican grip on Texas has deteriorated rapidly during the Trump era, as a Democratic breakthrough in the suburbs has endangered more than one-third of the state’s Republican congressional delegation and Republican control of the state House. In these districts, Republicans face a combination of rapid demographic change and previously unthinkable Democratic gains among white college-educated voters. Mr. Trump leads Mr. Biden by just two points among white college graduates in these districts, even though they say they backed Mr. Trump by 24 points over Hillary Clinton in 2016. The survey suggested that Mr. Biden’s support among Hispanic voters, 57 percent to 34 percent, is weaker than Mrs. Clinton’s was four years ago. The finding broadly tracks with national surveys, which have shown Mr. Trump improving among Hispanic voters compared with his 2016 standing. In 2018, Times/Siena surveys generally underestimated turnout by Hispanics and their support for Democrats in Texas. So far this cycle, polls have varied widely on Mr. Trump’s standing among the group in Texas, with a recent Quinnipiac survey showing Mr. Biden ahead by just eight points, 51-43, while a Dallas Morning News/UT Tyler Texas survey showed him ahead by a far wider margin, 67-20. — Nate Cohn When Representative Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat running for re-election in the conservative-leaning suburbs of Richmond, Va., arrived to debate her Republican opponent one recent evening, she received a heroine’s welcome from cheering supporters lining the street, holding balloons and handmade signs. There was no such warm reception for Nick Freitas, the state delegate running to oust her, recalled Carol Catron, 52, who was among those shouting “We love Abigail!” as Mr. Freitas walked in without making eye contact. The scene in a Republican-leaning district that voted heavily for President Trump in 2016 underscored how solidly Ms. Spanberger — a freshman once thought to have an uphill climb to re-election — has cemented her following and has the advantage with Election Day approaching. Across the country, Democrats like Ms. Spanberger, a former C.I.A. officer who has cultivated a brand as a moderate unafraid to criticize her own party, have helped positioned Democrats to maintain control of the House and build their majority. She and dozens of other first-term Democrats whose victories in Trump-friendly districts in 2018 handed the party control of the House — and who were seen as the most vulnerable to defeat this year — are leading their Republican challengers in polling and fund-raising headed into the election’s final week. Speaker Nancy Pelosi likes to call this group of about 40 lawmakers — mostly young, many women, and predominantly moderates — her “majority makers.” They have largely managed to buck intense Republican attempts to brand them as Ms. Pelosi’s minions, socialists or out-of-touch coastal elites. “We knew we had a lot of work to do when we got elected, and we got to work,” said Representative Lauren Underwood, Democrat of Illinois and a registered nurse. — Luke Broadwater President Trump walked out of his interview last week with the long-running CBS program “60 Minutes” and publicly accused its anchor Lesley Stahl of “bias, hatred and rudeness.” If Mr. Trump had hoped to dissuade viewers from watching the contentious interview — in which the president balked as Ms. Stahl questioned him about the coronavirus, the economy and health care and told her, “That’s no way to talk” — his tactics proved ill-advised. Nearly 17 million people watched Sunday’s “60 Minutes” broadcast, the show’s biggest audience since it secured an interview with the adult film actress (and alleged Trump paramour) Stormy Daniels in 2018, according to preliminary data from Nielsen. “60 Minutes” has the broadest reach of any TV news program, a category whose audience skews older, meaning Mr. Trump’s less-than-optimal interview was seen by millions of Americans above the age of 50, who are likely to be engaged in the political process — and a group Mr. Trump has been struggling with, according to opinion polls. This Sunday’s episode, which featured interviews with Mr. Trump, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and their running mates, drew more viewers than Game 5 of the World Series and an evening N.F.L. game on NBC. In fact, save for sporting events and the political conventions and debates, Sunday’s “60 Minutes” episode notched the biggest television audience of the year for any network since the Academy Awards in February, CBS officials said. The total audience for Mr. Trump’s interview was likely even higher, between online streaming views and additional viewing data that Nielsen is compiling and will release on Tuesday. — Michael M. Grynbaum AD WATCH Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign has returned to a familiar Democratic refrain in the final weeks of the 2020 campaign: promising to protect Social Security and accusing President Trump of undermining the program. There are a lot of 2020 ads about Social Security currently airing, including this one from the Biden campaign pic.twitter.com/WGoXUVKess One of Mr. Biden’s Social Security ads is narrated by an older voter in a long-sleeved union shirt, identified as “Mike” from Wayne County, Mich. “Donald Trump — he’s talking about messing with my Social Security?” says Mike. “Them guys think it’s monopoly money?” he asks defensively as video flashes of the president with some of his administration officials. “No, it’s our money. We worked for it. You don’t get to play with my financials.” The ad is tailored to older voters who Mr. Biden has polled better with than past Democrats. “He understands what seniors are going through,” Mike says. “We need to get Biden in there to protect it.” This particular Biden ad does not make specific claims about Mr. Trump’s plans for Social Security, but other Democratic ads have been more explicit, accusing Mr. Trump of supporting plans that would “wipe out” Social Security. At issue is that Mr. Trump has expressed support for cutting the payroll tax, which funds Social Security. At the same time, Mr. Trump has said “we’re not going to touch Social Security” and promises to forgive deferred payroll taxes without impacting the program. The ad also tries to reassure voters that Mr. Biden is going to protect their government benefits. His current plan calls for putting more resources behind Social Security, which would be paid for by higher taxes on the wealthy. The ad — which the Biden campaign has spent nearly $3.2 million on in the last two weeks — is running nationally and in many of the top battlegrounds, including Arizona, Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina and Nevada. The top market for the ad is Phoenix, which is home to a large retiree population. In the closing stretch, many of Mr. Trump’s ads are accusing Mr. Biden of wanting to raise taxes, and many of Mr. Biden’s are focused on Social Security. These campaign tactics show the continued resilience and resonance of those two political standbys — even amid a pandemic. — Shane Goldmacher Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has been spearheading the Trump campaign’s outreach to Black voters for over a year, arguing that even if President Trump can increase his support among them by as little as two percentage points, it could sway the election. On Monday, in an interview with “Fox & Friends,” however, he made comments seeming to question whether Black Americans “want to be successful,” a remark that played into a racist stereotype and was quickly seized on by the Democratic National Committee. “One thing we’ve seen in a lot of the Black community, which is mostly Democrat, is that President Trump’s policies are the policies that can help people break out of the problems that they’re complaining about,” Mr. Kushner said. “But he can’t want them to be successful more than they want to be successful.” The D.N.C. responded to Mr. Kushner’s remarks with a lengthy statement. “According to the Trump administration, when African Americans find fault in policies that have led to historic unemployment for Black families, an explosion of racial inequities and wealth gaps, and an uncontained global pandemic that has taken the lives of over 45,000 Black Americans, it means that we just don’t want to be successful badly enough,” it said. “This dismissive approach to the issues that Black voters care about is indicative of Trump’s callousness and disregard for the lives of Black people.” Mr. Kushner’s comments were widely denounced as racist on social media. “We will remember his casual racism,” Representative Don Beyer of Virginia, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, claimed that Mr. Kushner’s remarks had been taken out of context. Mr. Kushner’s comment came after a discussion of racial unrest, which he referred to as “the George Floyd situation,” a reference to the Black man who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis this summer. Mr. Kushner accused many protesters of virtue signaling. “They’d go on Instagram and cry or they would put a slogan on their jersey, or write something on a basketball court,” he said. “And quite frankly, that was doing more to polarize the country than it was to bring people forward.” He claimed what was more important was policies that have helped Black Americans, like criminal justice reform and the funding Mr. Trump has supported for historically Black colleges and universities. Those have been two of the administration’s main talking points in its outreach to Black voters, even as the president has made it clear in recent months that he believes the country’s real racism problem is bias against white Americans. Mr. Kushner said he has been hearing from Trump campaign state directors across the country about a “groundswell of support in the Black community, because they’re realizing that all of the different bad things that the media and the Democrats have said about President Trump are not true.” A recent CBS News poll found that 85 percent of registered Black voters felt that as president, Mr. Trump “favors white people.” About 79 percent of those voters said he “worked against” Black people. — Annie Karni The 2020 finish line is still more than a week away, but Democrats in Wisconsin believe that President Trump’s unpopularity will linger well into 2022, making one of his most loyal defenders, Senator Ron Johnson, a prime target in the midterms. On Monday, Tom Nelson, the Outagamie county executive and a former State Assembly majority leader, became the first Democrat to announce he would challenge Mr. Johnson, who has not yet said if he will seek re-election to a third term. The senator, who opposes mask mandates, tested positive for the coronavirus last month and backs Mr. Trump’s plans to reopen schools and businesses quickly, even as the pandemic rages on. Mr. Nelson said Mr. Johnson’s actions on the virus motivated him to run. “We are the hottest of the hot spots in the country,” said Mr. Nelson, 44, in a video posted to his Twitter page on Monday. “We are doing all that we can at the local level.” “There is just no help in sight, and people like Ron Johnson have made this worse,” he added. In announcing this early, Mr. Nelson hopes to stand out from what is expected to be a crowded primary field that might include Alex Lasry, an executive with the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes and Josh Kaul, the state attorney general. Mr. Nelson’s candidacy was first reported by Politico. Mr. Johnson had been a relatively unknown rank-and-file conservative before Mr. Trump was elected to office. Since then, he has been an aggressive defender of the president in his capacity as chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, pursuing investigations into Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s family business dealings. — Glenn Thrush The Office of the U.S. Special Counsel has opened a second investigation into whether Secretary of State Mike Pompeo violated federal laws by helping President Trump’s campaign in his official duties — including by speaking to the Republican National Convention while on a diplomatic trip to Jerusalem. Representatives Eliot L. Engel and Nita Lowey, Democrats of New York, confirmed the investigation into Mr. Pompeo’s convention speech on Monday. One week ago, the independent group American Oversight cited a special counsel investigator who confirmed a separate inquiry into Mr. Pompeo’s pledge to release any additional Hillary Clinton emails that might remain at the State Department, as Mr. Trump has demanded. At issue in both cases is whether the country’s chief diplomat violated the Hatch Act, a law that bans political activity in the federal workplace. Investigating potential Hatch Act violations is one of the four primary responsibilities of the Office of the U.S. Special Counsel. “As we get closer to both this year’s election and his own inevitable return to electoral politics, Mike Pompeo has grown even more brazen in misusing the State Department and the taxpayer dollars that fund it as vehicles for the administration’s, and his own, political ambitions,” Mr. Engel, the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s chairman, and Ms. Lowey, who chairs the Appropriations Committee, wrote in a statement on Monday. They said the State Department has either withheld or delayed necessary documents the committees have demanded for its own investigations into whether Mr. Pompeo’s speeches to conservative audiences in Florida, Iowa and elsewhere amount to improper political activity. Mr. Pompeo is widely believed to be courting support for his own political ambitions — including a potential presidential run in 2024 — as well as urging Americans to vote as he extols Trump administration policies. For nearly a year, Democrats in Congress have accused Mr. Pompeo of using taxpayer-funded government aircraft for speeches in political bellwether states and hosting receptions at the State Department for potential donors and Republican influencers. In January, the Office of Special Counsel, reported that it found no evidence that Mr. Pompeo acted improperly while exploring a Senate run from Kansas last year. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. — Lara Jakes The news over the weekend that another coronavirus outbreak had struck the White House, infecting Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff and four other top aides, further underscored the Trump administration’s cavalier approach to the worst health crisis in a century. “We’re not going to control the pandemic,” Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday morning, essentially offering a verbal shrug in response to any effort to prevent an outbreak in the top echelon of the nation’s leaders. “We are going to control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics and other mitigations, because it is a contagious virus — just like the flu.” The in-house outbreak, playing against the national backdrop of the biggest three-day total of new infections in the entire course of the pandemic, is also making it harder for the president to change the subject as he dashes through swing states in a bid to mount a come-from-behind victory. “Covid, Covid. Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid,” Mr. Trump had groused at a rally in North Carolina on Saturday, hours before the revelation of the infections on his running mate’s staff. He made up a scenario: “A plane goes down, 500 people dead, they don’t talk about it. ‘Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid.’” Mr. Trump made no reference to the new cases during campaign rallies in New Hampshire and Maine on Sunday. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, said Sunday that the statement by Mr. Meadows was “an acknowledgment of what President Trump’s strategy has clearly been from the beginning of this crisis: to wave the white flag of defeat and hope that by ignoring it, the virus would simply go away. It hasn’t, and it won’t. “It’s sadly no surprise then that this virus continues to rage unchecked across the country and even in the White House itself,” said Mr. Biden, who has sought to make the administration’s handling of the coronavirus the centerpiece of his campaign. — Michael D. Shear, Annie Karni, Maggie Haberman and Sheryl Gay Stolberg The head of a federal panel that advises the White House on compensation issues resigned on Monday to protest President Trump’s new executive order that could wipe out employment protections for tens of thousands of federal workers. Ronald P. Sanders, the chairman of the Federal Salary Council, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in 2017, said that the new executive order would replace “political expertise with political obeisance.” The order, signed last week, gives Mr. Trump and his political appointees the power to hire and fire certain federal civil servants who now hold jobs that are supposed to be exempt from political influence. “The Executive Order is nothing more than a smokescreen for what is clearly an attempt to require the political loyalty of those who advise the President, or failing that, to enable their removal with little if any due process,” Mr. Sanders, who called himself a lifelong Republican, wrote in his resignation letter, dated today and sent to the White House. “I have concluded that as a matter of conscience, I can no longer serve him or his administration.” The president’s executive order has already provoked protests by federal labor unions and some Democrats in Congress. If Mr. Trump is not re-elected, the next administration could repeal the measure. Mr. Sanders wrote of civil servants, “The only ‘boss’ that they serve is the public,” adding, “No president should be able to remove career civil servants whose only sin is that they may speak such a truth to him.” The board Mr. Sanders resigned from is made up of experts in labor relations and representatives of federal labor unions. A White House official did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House, in a statement that accompanied the executive order, said the new employee classification was justified because under current rules “removing poor performers, even from these critical positions, is time-consuming and difficult.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
