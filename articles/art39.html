Former Trump officials back Biden, saying it is time to put ‘country over party.’ The F.B.I. director warns during a House hearing that Biden is the target of Russian disinformation efforts. Election results will take longer, but not because of ‘unsolicited ballots,’ despite Trump’s claims. Amy Dorris, a former model, alleges that Trump sexually assaulted her at the U.S. Open in 1997. Biden tells Democratic senators he takes ‘nothing for granted,’ despite lead in polls. Richard Uihlein, a top G.O.P. megadonor, gave another $10 million in August. Trump’s ‘secret’ health plan is a promise voters have heard before. Olivia Troye, the former top homeland security aide to Vice President Mike Pence, endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday and accused President Trump of weak leadership and of dramatically mismanaging the response to the coronavirus crisis. In an ad released online, Ms. Troye recounts hearing the president — who has spoken about his phobia of germs — say in a meeting that he was glad that the virus had arrived in the United States, because it meant he would no longer have to shake hands with people he said he considered “disgusting.” She said she is voting for Mr. Biden because she believes the nation is in a “constitutional crisis” and that “at this point it’s country over party.” In a statement, Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, responded by saying, “Outside of generally watching the White House coronavirus task force from the overflow staff room, this disgruntled former detailee was never in private meetings with the president and her assertions have no basis in reality and are flat out inaccurate.” Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the national security adviser to Vice President Pence, said Ms. Troye never once expressed “any concern regarding the administration’s response to the coronavirus to anyone in her chain of command.” Ms. Troye, who played a central role in running the White House’s coronavirus task force until leaving the government last month, is one of two top Trump administration officials who announced their opposition to Mr. Trump on Thursday and joined more than two dozen other Republican officials as part of a new group calling for “leadership change in the White House.” Josh Venable, who served as chief of staff for Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, will also join the group, known as REPAIR (Republican Political Alliance for Integrity and Reform), according to a statement. John Mitnick, the former top lawyer at Mr. Trump’s Department of Homeland Security, is an adviser to the group. Ms. Troye, a lifelong Republican who also worked in the George W. Bush administration, said in the statement that she will serve as a co-founder of the group, with the goal of restoring integrity to the Republican Party. “We will listen to Americans, including those who’ve been harmed by the policies and rhetoric of the current administration, with the goal of restoring civil discourse and advocating for policies which recognize the dignity and worth of all people,” she said. The effort is being spearheaded by Miles Taylor, who served as the chief of staff to Kirstjen Nielsen, the former secretary of homeland security. Last month, Mr. Taylor endorsed Mr. Biden and wrote in The Washington Post that Mr. Trump was “dangerous” and had governed the country “by whim, political calculation and self-interest.” REPAIR joins other groups of Republicans who oppose Mr. Trump’s bid for a second term, including Republican Voters Against Trump and The Lincoln Project, a political action committee formed by current and former Republicans. In its statement on Thursday, REPAIR said the members of the group will work to return the Republican Party to what it called “principled leadership.” “Weak leaders, nationwide discord and a confluence of crises are threatening our country’s greatness,” said Sarah Longwell, executive director of Defending Democracy Together, a separate group that is backing the efforts by REPAIR. “Now is the time to speak up. REPAIR will promote authoritative voices and shape the debate about America’s direction.” — Michael D. Shear Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a Republican who was set to appear with President Trump at a campaign rally in the state Thursday night, said he would skip the trip and self-isolate for two weeks after coming into contact with someone with the virus. A statement from his Senate office said that Mr. Johnson had tested negative for the coronavirus Wednesday evening and was not experiencing symptoms. But out of caution and because little time had passed since the exposure, he canceled plans to travel to Wisconsin aboard Air Force One with Mr. Trump and appear at the rally in Mosinee. Ben Voelkel, his spokesman, said Mr. Johnson planned to isolate until Sept. 29, meaning he would likely miss crucial votes as the Senate considers a temporary catchall government funding bill and potentially additional coronavirus relief legislation. His plan to quarantine was not expected to delay the release of a much-anticipated report that he drafted with the Senate Homeland Security Committee he leads and that he has boasted would wound Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee. Mr. Johnson had said the results of his investigation would become public in the next few days. The report, which is said to focus on work that Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter, performed for a corrupt Ukrainian energy firm while his father was vice president, has become mired in controversy. Democrats have accused Mr. Johnson of using Senate powers to engage in political smears of Mr. Biden with baseless claims and innuendo, a claim that Mr. Johnson has denied. They have also warned that in doing so, Mr. Johnson is amplifying a known Russian misinformation campaign meant to sow doubt about Mr. Biden’s integrity.   Though there have been no major outbreaks of the virus in Congress, it has been a constant presence in the Capitol since the spring, with dozens of lawmakers either testing positive or proactively quarantining themselves after coming into contact with someone who had. — Nicholas Fandos Christopher Wray, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said during a House Homeland Security committee hearing on Thursday that Joseph R. Biden Jr. was the primary target of Russia’s ongoing online disinformation campaigns. Mr. Wray said that while Russia has not successfully hacked any election systems, the influence campaign on social media has sought to raise skepticism of the Democratic candidate. “We certainly have seen very active, very active efforts by the Russians to influence our election in 2020,” Mr. Wray said on Thursday. “An effort to both sow divisiveness and discord, and I think the intelligence community has assessed this publicly, to primarily to denigrate Vice President Biden in what the Russians see as a kind of an anti-Russian establishment.” Mr. Wray’s comments echoed a statement made by last month by William R. Evanina, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, who said Russia has used a range of techniques to target Mr. Biden. China has also sought to influence American politics, intelligence officials have said, although Russia presents a much more immediate threat. While Mr. Wray and Mr. Evanina issued blunt warnings of the Russian disinformation campaign, Attorney General William P. Barr has been less forceful. Asked on CNN earlier this month if he accepted that Russia was attempting to interfere in the election, Mr. Barr said, “I accept that there is some preliminary activity that suggests that they might try again.” The Department of Homeland Security was also scrutinized earlier this month after it emerged that the agency declined to publish a July 9 intelligence document warning of Russian attempts to denigrate Mr. Biden’s mental health. That bulletin also warned of China and Iran’s efforts to target Mr. Trump. At the time, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, Chad F. Wolf, said he questioned the quality of the report and sent it back for revision. An updated version of the bulletin dated Sept. 4 obtained by The Times still includes warnings of Russia’s efforts to target Mr. Biden with additional details on how the nation’s tactics compare to China and Iran. “Iranian and Chinese overt influence actors have promoted unsubstantiated narratives that question the mental health of President Trump,” analysts said in the bulletin. “These efforts probably fall short of Russia’s more sustained, coordinated malign influence operations across multiple overt and covert platforms to undermine other U.S. politicians.” — Zolan Kanno-Youngs It has been clear for months that it is unlikely a winner in the presidential election will be declared on election night this year, as many battleground states expect unprecedented surges in mail-in ballots, which take much longer to process, certify and tabulate than traditional in-person voting. But two tweets from President Trump Thursday morning erroneously sought to blame states that are automatically mailing out ballots to registered voters for the likely delays and baselessly stated that the results “may NEVER BE ACCURATELY DETERMINED,” an assertion dismissed by elections experts. There is absolutely no evidence that states that automatically send out mail-in ballots to all voters have had issues with accuracy, and some such as Colorado, Washington and Oregon have been conducting their elections mostly by mail for years. Mail-in voting is considered especially secure and accurate because it has a clear paper trail, which makes recounts easier. However, mail-in ballots are likely rejected at higher rates than attempts to vote in person. In 24 primary elections this year, more than 500,000 mail-in ballots were rejected, or 2 percent of those returned by voters, according to an analysis by Michael McDonald, a voter turnout expert at the University of Florida. In some states, like Kentucky, the rejection rate was more than 4 percent. There is also little likelihood that the states that are automatically sending out ballots will have much of an impact on the Electoral College, and therefore contribute to any prolonged wait for a winner in the presidential election. Nine states and Washington, D.C., automatically mail out ballots; of those, only Nevada is a true battleground state. The rest are either reliably blue or red, and will likely be called within minutes of polls closing for either Mr. Trump or Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee. The states that will likely need more time to count ballots are ones that are no-excuse absentee ballot states, where anyone who wants to vote by mail can do so but must proactively request their ballot. Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, have both voted this way in the past, and the president, while not always very clearly, has said he supports absentee ballots. “Solicited Ballots (absentee) are OK,” he wrote in a tweet on Thursday. Battleground states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Florida and North Carolina are no-excuse absentee states. Election officials in many of those states have indicated that they will need more time to process the expected torrent of mail-in ballots, as they experienced in the primaries. Election officials in Philadelphia, for example, needed a week to fully tabulate votes after the June primary. Mr. Trump’s tweets are the latest in a series of inaccurate posts he has published for months on social media about the efficacy of mail-in ballots. It is part of what has been a longtime conundrum for social media companies that have debated how to handle posts by Mr. Trump, a world leader whose posts are typically considered newsworthy. Twitter, for its part, began adding labels to some of Mr. Trump’s tweets in May marking them as misleading, and it added one such label on Thursday. The service has been stricter with other leaders. In March, tweets from the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, and the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, that promoted unproven cures for the coronavirus were removed.  — Nick Corasaniti and Davey Alba A woman on Thursday added her voice to the chorus of those who have accused President Trump of sexual assault or misconduct over the past 40 years, coming forward in an interview with The Guardian to say that he kissed and groped her against her will at the United States Open tennis tournament in 1997. The woman, Amy Dorris, a former model, said she was invited, along with her boyfriend at the time, to Mr. Trump’s private box to watch the tennis match. Ms. Dorris was 24. “He just shoved his tongue down my throat and I was pushing him off,” Ms. Dorris said, explaining she met Mr. Trump through the boyfriend, Jason Binn. “And then that’s when his grip became tighter and his hands were very gropey and all over my butt, my breasts, my back, everything.” She added: “I was in his grip, and I couldn’t get out of it. I don’t know what you call that when you’re sticking your tongue just down someone’s throat. But I pushed it out with my teeth. I was pushing it. And I think I might have hurt his tongue.” In a statement, the Trump campaign denied Ms. Dorris’s account. “The allegations are totally false,” Jenna Ellis, a legal adviser to the Trump campaign, said in a statement. “We will consider every legal means available to hold The Guardian accountable for its malicious publication of this unsubstantiated story. This is just another pathetic attempt to attack President Trump right before the election.” Mr. Trump has consistently denied the accusations from more than two dozen women who have come forward with stories of unwanted groping, kissing and assault, dating back to the 1970s. In the case of Natasha Stoynoff — a journalist who claimed Mr. Trump assaulted her when she was conducting an interview with his wife, Melania Trump — the president made her claim a punchline at a rally. “Look at her. … I don’t think so,” he said. Mr. Trump is currently the subject of a defamation lawsuit from the author E. Jean Carroll, who has accused him of raping her in a Manhattan department store in the 1990s. In an unusual move last week, the Justice Department moved to replace the private legal team defending the president with government lawyers. Ms. Carroll sued Mr. Trump last November, claiming that he lied by publicly denying he had ever met her. In her interview with The Guardian, Ms. Dorris explained that the reason she had waited so long to come forward with her story was because she felt protective of her twin daughters. But they had also inspired her to speak out, she said. “Now I feel like my girls are about to turn 13 years old and I want them to know that you don’t let anybody do anything to you that you don’t want,” she said. “And I’d rather be a role model. I want them to see that I didn’t stay quiet, that I stood up to somebody who did something that was unacceptable.” — Annie Karni Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke with Democratic senators on Thursday, discussing in broad strokes what his agenda would be as president and stressing that he was running a campaign intended in part to bolster Democratic candidates down the ballot. It was Mr. Biden’s first time speaking with the Senate Democratic conference since formally becoming the party’s presidential nominee, and multiple senators said he emphasized that he would not become complacent despite his advantage in the polls. Mr. Biden discussed his campaign strategy and the response his team was seeing in individual states, and described how his administration would address the pandemic and the country’s economic recovery. “He must have said this three times: ‘I take nothing for granted. I know the polls look OK right now but I’m working tirelessly,’” said Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a staunch ally of Mr. Biden. “Some of it was the mechanics, polling, travel, schedule. Some of it was the core themes and message, why I’m running, what all this is about. And a lot of it was, we need to work together.” Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland said Mr. Biden was “not overconfident” about his chances. “He knows the attacks are coming and the unpredictables are coming,” Mr. Cardin said. “We have to be prepared for everything.” Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan noted that there were “a lot of shout outs for Jill Biden,” and the amount of campaigning she has done on behalf of her husband, as well as a conversation about Senate races, including in Alabama and Michigan, where Democrats are defending seats. There was no discussion, multiple senators said, of ending the 60-vote filibuster. “It was very upbeat, but the vice president is taking nothing for granted,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. “He talked about the dignity of work. Lunchbox Joe was very present.” Mr. Van Hollen said Mr. Biden did not engage in a detailed policy conversation but emphasized the importance of not losing jobs to China and creating “homegrown jobs here in America.” The message was “work hard until the polls close in November,” Mr. Van Hollen said. — Emily Cochrane, Luke Broadwater and Nicholas Fandos Richard Uihlein, a conservative packaging supplies magnate, plunged another $10 million into the 2020 election in August, donating to the Club for Growth just as the group began spending on the presidential campaign. The Club for Growth, a conservative political group, has spent more than $10 million since Mr. Uihlein’s donation in August on independent expenditures opposing Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, and supporting President Trump. The group announced two television ads last month, buying airtime in the pivotal states of Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In addition to Mr. Uihlein, the Club for Growth received another $10 million from Jeff Yass, the founder of a Pennsylvania-based investment company, and $1 million from Richard Gaby, whose wife, Barbara Van Andel-Gaby, serves as chair of the board of trustees of the Heritage Foundation. All told, Mr. Uihlein and his wife, Elizabeth, have given $50 million to conservative candidates and political groups since 2019, making the couple one of the biggest sources of cash on the Republican side. Besides his Club for Growth donations — Mr. Uihlein gave another $10 million to the group in January — he has also invested $11.4 million in a group called Restoration PAC, which has spent nearly $10 million against Mr. Biden. In an interview over the summer, Ms. Uihlein expressed frustration with politicians — including Mr. Trump and some of his rhetoric, despite her constant support of him. “I’m sorry it’s such a horrible money game,” she said of the election cycle. “I think a lot of people just tune off. They’re sick of the whole thing.” Ms. Uihlein also bemoaned that the president and Democrats in Congress hadn’t been able to put differences aside and work toward common goals. “It’s too bad that something happened with Trump and Pelosi,” she said. “It would be nice if these politicians just got together for the good of the country. I think the American people are sick of it.” — Rachel Shorey, Shane Goldmacher and Rebecca R. Ruiz As Donald J. Trump ran for the White House, he promised to “come up with a great health plan” that would replace the Affordable Care Act with something better that maintained its biggest selling point: protecting people with pre-existing medical conditions. Once elected, he swore he had a “wonderful plan” and would be “putting it in fairly soon.” On Tuesday night, President Trump returned to the theme during a town-hall-style meeting broadcast on ABC, where he was taken to task by Ellesia Blaque, an assistant professor at Kutztown University in Pennsylvania. She told him she had a congenital illness, demanded to know what he would do to keep “people like me who work hard” insured. “We’re going to be doing a health care plan very strongly, and protect people with pre-existing conditions,” Mr. Trump told her, adding, “I have it all ready, and it’s a much better plan for you, and it’s a much better plan.” But after four years, the unkept promise may be catching up to Mr. Trump. There still does not seem to be any plan, because other than abolishing the Affordable Care Act — which requires insurers to cover pre-existing conditions and which the White House is asking the Supreme Court to overturn — the Republican Party cannot agree on one. And with tens of thousands of Americans losing their coverage to a coronavirus-induced economic turndown, fears of inadequate or nonexistent health insurance have never been greater. “What the public wants to know is, ‘Where am I going to get health insurance and how much is it going to cost me,’ and that plan didn’t really provide any kind of direction for getting answers to that,” said James C. Capretta, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who advised President George W. Bush on health policy.  — Sheryl Gay Stolberg In an event with Black female leaders in Philadelphia on Thursday, Senator Kamala Harris discussed what she said would be a key priority if she is elected vice president: addressing racial disparities in health and education. Speaking in the Mount Airy neighborhood, Ms. Harris, Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s vice-presidential running mate, cited as one goal bringing down the maternal mortality rate for Black women, which exceeds the rate for white women. “When a Black woman walks into a doctor’s office or a clinic or a hospital, she is not taken seriously, or as seriously as other people,” Ms. Harris said, noting data that Black women were three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth. “Part of the agenda is about what we need to do to track racial disparities in health care, but also to deal with racial biases within the health care system.” About 15 people sat in a backyard in chairs that were spaced out at the event, which was hosted by She Can Win, a group that invests in women interested in civil engagement and leadership. Ms. Harris said another high-priority area she and Mr. Biden were pursuing was providing a path for small businesses to have access to capital through low-interest government loans. She also pledged to provide government funding of $70 billion for historically Black public and private colleges and universities. At the event, she called for the establishment of a national database to track police officers who break the law and to prevent officers who have been fired or been disciplined for violence elsewhere from moving to other jurisdictions. Earlier in the day, Ms. Harris met with U.S. Representative Dwight Evans for a tour of local businesses, including a florist shop and a Black-owned restaurant, in the West Oak Lane neighborhood of Philadelphia. “Is the win defined by defeating Donald Trump?” Ms. Harris said to the group. “Or is the win defined by winning? And I say that because if you use that first definition, then the job is over the day we’re inaugurated. If you go by that second definition, which is what I am compelled to do this for, then the job begins that day.” — Jenny Gross AD WATCH Amid the most unusual presidential election in decades, the Trump campaign is turning to a very familiar Republican line of attack in two new ads: that Joseph R. Biden Jr. will raise your taxes. The ad is built around the message that President Trump had planned to run on before the virus struck: a humming economy. A small-business owner, standing on a peaceful, leafy suburban street, praises the president for “the economy that we’ve been enjoying.” She portrays electing Mr. Biden as a move that would devastate the economic progress that was underway before the pandemic. She accuses Mr. Biden of wanting to add more taxes and regulation, as the ad displays a selectively edited clip of Mr. Biden from the campaign trail saying “if you elect me your taxes will go up.” In closing, the small business owner says what the Trump campaign has been hoping will hold true in polling: that she trusts Mr. Trump to rebuild the economy. Mr. Biden will not raise taxes across the board. Rather, he is proposing raising taxes on people earning more than $400,000 to help finance much of his agenda for recovering from the coronavirus pandemic. The ad also begins with an allusion to “the economy that we’ve been enjoying,” but the current economic status of the country is in shambles because of the coronavirus pandemic, with unemployment at 8.4 percent. And while the economy before the coronavirus was indeed strong, with low unemployment and a soaring stock market, it’s not wholly accurate to proclaim it was “the best it had ever been,” as the video claims. Income inequality continued to grow, and while average hourly wage growth improved, it was not as strong as in decades past. The employment cost index, while also improved, was not the highest ever. North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona, Pennsylvania and two states that split electoral votes by congressional district: Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District and Maine’s 2nd Congressional District. While the bully pulpit of the president’s Twitter account continues to rail against protesters and cast false aspersions about voting, the paid messaging arm of the Trump campaign is increasingly focused on an economic message. — Nick Corasaniti THE UPSHOT Another good day for Biden in Wisconsin: An ABC News/Washington Post poll Wednesday found Joseph R. Biden Jr. up by six points among likely voters in Wisconsin, putting him in a strong position in the state, hovering at or above 50 percent with a consistent lead in an unusual number of recent high-quality surveys. Wisconsin was a “tipping point” state in 2016 and many thought it would be a real challenge for Mr. Biden. The state’s white working-class voters swung hard to President Trump in 2016, and Mr. Biden seemed to be weaker in Milwaukee’s suburbs than in suburbs elsewhere. And the unrest in Kenosha seemed to give Mr. Trump another opening. But it didn’t lead to a change in the state of the race, and that might say something about the national political environment. An eye-popper in Minnesota: ABC News/Washington Post also released a poll of neighboring Minnesota, showing Mr. Biden ahead by 16 points in a state Hillary Clinton won by under 2 percent. The poll is probably an outlier, but Mr. Biden’s lead in Minnesota is large, and it’s real. An even bigger eye-popper in Maine: Quinnipiac released a poll of Maine with very strong results for Democrats: a 12-point lead for Sara Gideon, who is trying to unseat the incumbent Republican senator, Susan Collins; and a 21-point lead for Mr. Biden. A word of caution: Quinnipiac has leaned quite a bit to the left in this cycle. A split between state and national polls? State polls this week have shown strong results for Mr. Biden. But national polls show stability, or even a bit of tightening. It’s hard to know what to make of the split. It could be just noise: The national polling is sparse and often of questionable quality. But there may be a real split, driven by demographics: Most of the great results for Mr. Biden in recent state polls have come in overwhelmingly white states, and there are plenty of national (and state) poll results suggesting that Mr. Biden is running ahead of Mrs. Clinton among white voters but faring worse among nonwhite voters. That could lead to seemingly surprising results for Mr. Biden in overwhelmingly white states like Minnesota and Maine without corresponding national leads. That would not necessarily be a bad trade for Mr. Biden. Mrs. Clinton probably would have traded a few points nationwide for greater support in the Midwest. Good news for Democrats in the Senate: Quinnipiac found a tie in South Carolina between Senator Lindsey Graham and his Democratic challenger, Jaime Harrison.
 — Nate Cohn Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court delivered a pair of significant victories to Democrats on Thursday, blocking a third-party presidential candidate from the ballot this fall and extending the state’s deadline for receiving mail-in votes. Early in the day, the court ruled that the Green Party and its candidate, Howie Hawkins, failed to follow electoral procedures and cannot appear on the ballot this fall — a significant win for Democrats seeking to recapture a battleground state that narrowly swung to President Trump in 2016. The high court, by a 5-to-2 margin, partially reversed a lower court decision that had permitted Mr. Hawkins, an environmental activist from New York, to appear on the ballot, while kicking off his running mate. The decision removed a final hurdle for county boards of elections, who can now mail ballots to registered voters who have applied for them. The case has been a focal point for both major-party campaigns, which have been focusing intensely on a state that had been reliably Democratic since Harry Truman’s election in 1948. In 2016, the Green Party’s nominee, Jill Stein, drew nearly 50,000 votes — more than Mr. Trump’s 44,000-vote margin of victory. Later, the court extended the state’s mail ballot deadlines, a move opposed by Republicans and the Trump campaign. The decision is likely to increase voter participation and could delay the release of final results from a state that could determine the outcome of the national election. State law requires mail-in ballots to be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day, but this year because of the pandemic they will be counted if received by 5 p.m. the Friday after the election. The high court also greenlighted the use of drop boxes for ballots and denied attempts by the Trump campaign to post poll watchers outside of their home counties. — Glenn Thrush MIAMI — Jeff Gruver voted for the first time ever in March, casting an enthusiastic ballot for Bernie Sanders in Florida’s presidential primary. He planned to vote for Joseph R. Biden Jr. in November until he found out on Friday he could not vote at all. A federal appeals court ruled that Floridians with felony criminal records, like him, could not vote unless they paid all their outstanding court fines and fees — in his case, at least $800. Mr. Gruver does not have the money. And he does not want to take any risk that his vote could be deemed illegal. Like more than a million other ex-felons, he has learned that even an overwhelming 2018 vote approving a state referendum to restore voting rights to most people who had served their sentences does not necessarily mean that they will ever get to vote. The gutting last week of the effort to re-enfranchise former felons is a cautionary tale about the messy process of citizen-led ballot initiatives and how a dominant political party can exert its power long after voters have spoken. “The political climate in Florida — it just kind of feels rigged by one group in power over the other,” said Mr. Gruver, 34, who runs a homeless shelter in Gainesville and more than a decade ago did a total of about 10 months in jail for cocaine possession and violating the terms of his probation. — Patricia Mazzei and Michael Wines As President Trump ramps up advertising claiming that Joe Biden will raise taxes and destroy the economy, Biden campaign officials are punching back, describing Mr. Trump as a president who “looks down on working people.” “Joe Biden sees this election as Park Avenue versus Scranton,” Kate Bedingfield, Mr. Biden’s deputy campaign manager, said in a call with reporters on Thursday, referring to Mr. Biden’s Pennsylvania hometown. “We’ve got a president in Donald Trump who can only see as far as Wall Street and who looks down on working people.” “Joe Biden just has a fundamentally different view of what it means for the economy to be doing well than Donald Trump does,” she continued. “Joe Biden believes the economy is not doing well unless middle-class families and working people are doing well.” The call came as Mr. Trump’s campaign has released a set of television ads that attack Mr. Biden’s tax policies and assert that Mr. Trump has built “the strongest economy we’ve ever seen.” “If Joe Biden gets elected, we can kiss goodbye to the economy that we’ve been enjoying,” a woman who describes herself as a small-business owner says in one ad. “He’s going to raise taxes, he’s already said that.” The Biden campaign in its call did not dispute that he would raise taxes, but insisted that taxes would not increase for those making less than $400,000 a year. “I want to be very, very clear about something: If you make under $400,000 — if you are an individual who makes under $400,000 — you will not pay a penny more in taxes when Joe Biden is president. Period. End of story,” Ms. Bedingfield said. She accused Mr. Trump of engineering “a huge tax giveaway for the super wealthy and for corporations.” Mr. Trump’s approval ratings on the economy remain high, and allies have been urging Mr. Biden to focus more on Mr. Trump’s stewardship of the economy. Last week, during a campaign stop at an auto workers union in Michigan, he sketched a plan to keep more jobs in the United States. — Sydney Ember Dan Coats, President Trump’s former director of national intelligence, called on Congress on Thursday to create a nonpartisan panel to reassure Americans that the results of the election are legitimate. In a New York Times Op-Ed, Mr. Coats wrote that the panel was needed to “save our democracy.” The proposed commission would monitor systems that were already in place to count, evaluate and certify election results, Mr. Coats wrote. In doing so, it could confirm that election laws and regulations had been “scrupulously and expeditiously followed — or that violations have been exposed and dealt with — without political prejudice and without regard to political interests of either party.” The goal, he added, was to “firmly, unambiguously reassure all Americans that their vote will be counted.” Hours after Mr. Coats’s proposal was published, Mr. Trump, his former boss, once again sought to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the upcoming election. “Because of the new and unprecedented massive amount of unsolicited ballots which will be sent to ‘voters,’ or wherever, this year, the Nov 3rd Election result may NEVER BE ACCURATELY DETERMINED, which is what some want,” Mr. Trump tweeted Thursday morning. “Stop Ballot Madness!” Mr. Coats’s proposal represents a striking departure from the approach taken by his successor, John Ratcliffe, who has tried to limit congressional briefings on foreign election interference. Mr. Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana who was national intelligence director from early 2017 until mid-2019, angered the president by providing unwelcome assessments of Russia and its efforts to undermine the 2020 elections. He left office in frustration, according to former senior administration officials. Mr. Ratcliffe, a former Republican congressman from Texas who fiercely defended the president during the Russia investigation, has downplayed such threats, an approach the president prefers. In his Op-Ed, Mr. Coats did not refer to Mr. Trump or his supporters directly. But he made his case in the starkest possible terms. Our democracy’s enemies, foreign and domestic, want us to concede in advance that our voting systems are faulty or fraudulent; that sinister conspiracies have distorted the political will of the people; that our public discourse has been perverted by the news media and social networks riddled with prejudice, lies and ill will; that judicial institutions, law enforcement and even national security have been twisted, misused and misdirected to create anxiety and conflict, not justice and social peace. If those are the results of this tumultuous election year, we are lost, no matter which candidate wins. No American, and certainly no American leader, should want such an outcome. Total destruction and sowing salt in the earth of American democracy is a catastrophe well beyond simple defeat and a poison for generations. Requests for comment from the White House and congressional leaders were not immediately returned. — Glenn Thrush Attorney General William P. Barr has ratcheted up his involvement in partisan politics in recent days, floating federal sedition charges against violent protesters and the prosecution of a Democratic mayor; asserting his right to intervene in Justice Department investigations; warning of dire consequences for the nation if President Trump is not re-elected; and comparing coronavirus restrictions to slavery. Mr. Barr’s comments came in remarks on Wednesday at a college event, an interview with Chicago journalists and a call with federal prosecutors last week. Sedition comments: Mr. Barr told prosecutors in the call to consider charging rioters and others who had committed violent crimes at protests in recent months with sedition, according to two people familiar with the call. The highly unusual suggestion to charge people with insurrection against lawful authority alarmed some on the call, which included U.S. attorneys around the country, said the people, who spoke only anonymously because they feared retribution. The remarks were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Weighing charges against Seattle’s mayor: The attorney general has also asked prosecutors in the Justice Department’s civil rights division to explore criminally charging Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle for allowing a police-free protest zone near the city’s downtown for weeks this summer, according to two people briefed on those discussions. The directives are in keeping with Mr. Barr’s approach to prosecute aggressively in cities where protests have turned violent. But in suggesting prosecuting Ms. Durkan, a Democrat, Mr. Barr also took aim at an elected official whom President Trump has repeatedly attacked. Presidential contest: Mr. Barr told a Chicago Tribune columnist in an interview published Monday that the nation could find itself “irrevocably committed to the socialist path” if Mr. Trump lost the election and that the country faced “a clear fork in the road.” Comparing virus restrictions to slavery: Speaking at an event hosted by Hillsdale College on Wednesday, Mr. Barr said that some state governors had overreached in enacting stay-at-home orders and closing businesses. “Other than slavery, which is a different kind of restraint, this is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history,” he said. Intervening in D.O.J. investigations: Mr. Barr said in his speech at the event that as the nation’s top law enforcement official, he had the right to intervene in investigations and to overrule career lawyers, castigating his own department and attacking what he described as politically motivated inquiries. His remarks scanned as a rebuke of career Justice Department lawyers who have questioned his level of involvement — a management style in which he has cast himself as the ultimate authority on almost every issue that the department faces, including antitrust settlements, criminal prosecutions and civil litigation. “Because I am ultimately accountable for every decision the department makes, I have an obligation to ensure we make the correct ones,” he said. — Katie Benner A clash looms today over voting by mail as the postmaster general meets with secretaries of state from around the country.
