I started reporting this story at the very same moment as I was trying to figure out my own relationship to the subject of this story, white parents in New York City public schools. I was about to be one of them. When my kid was old enough, I started learning about my options. I had many. There was our zoned public school in Brooklyn, or I could apply to a handful of specialty programs — a gifted program, or a magnet school, or a language program. So I started to look around. This was five years ago now, but I vividly remember these tours. I’d show up in the lobby of the school at the time listed on the website, look around, and notice that all or almost all of the other parents who’d shown up for the 11:00 AM, middle-of-the-workday, early-in-the-shopping-season school tour were other white parents. As a group, we’d walk the halls, following a school administrator — almost always a man or woman of color — through a school full of black and brown kids. We’d peer into classroom windows, watch the kids sit in a circle on the rug, ask questions about the lunch menu, homework policy, discipline. Some of us would take notes. And the administrators would sell. The whole thing was essentially a pitch. We offer STEM. We have a partnership with Lincoln Center. We have a dance studio. They were pleading with us to please take part in this public school. I don’t think I’ve ever felt my own consumer power more viscerally than I did shopping for a public school as a white parent. We were entering schools that people like us had ignored for decades. They were not our places, but we were being invited to make them ours. The whole thing was made so much more awkward by the fact that nobody on those tours ever acknowledged the obvious racial difference, that roughly 100% of the parents in this group did not match, say, 90% of the kids in this building. I remember one time being guided into a classroom and being told that this was the class for gifted kids, and noticing, oh, here’s where all the white kids are. Everyone on our tour saw this, all of us parents, but nobody said anything, including me. We walked out into the hallway. A mom raised her hand and said, I do have one question I’ve been meaning to ask. And the group got quiet. I was thinking, OK, here it comes. But then she said, do the kids here play outside every day?  I knew the schools were segregated. I shouldn’t have been surprised. By the time I was touring schools as a parent, I had spent a fair amount of time in schools as a reporter. I’d done stories on the stark inequality in public education. And I’d looked at some of the many programs and reforms we’ve tried to fix our schools. So many ideas. We’ve tried standardized tests and charter schools. We’ve tried smaller classes, longer school days, stricter discipline, looser discipline, tracking, differentiation. We’ve decided the problem is teachers, the problem is parents. What is true about almost all of these reforms is that when we look for what’s broken, for how our schools are failing, we focus on who they’re failing — poor kids, black kids, and brown kids. We ask, why aren’t they performing better? Why aren’t they achieving more? Those are not the right questions. There is a powerful force that is shaping our public schools, arguably the most powerful force. It’s there even when we pretend not to notice it, like on that school tour. If you want to understand why our schools aren’t better, that’s where you have to look. You have to look at white parents. From Serial Productions, I’m Channa Joffe-Walt. This is “Nice White Parents,” a series about the 60-year relationship between white parents and the public school down the block. [CHILDREN CHATTERING] I’m going to take you inside a public school building, an utterly ordinary, squat, three-story New York City public school building not far from where I live. This isn’t one of the schools I’ve toured. And my own kids don’t go here. They’re too little. This is a middle and high school called the School for International Studies, SIS. The story I want to tell you spans decades in this one school building, but I’m going to begin when I first encountered SIS, in the spring of 2015, right before everything changed. In 2015, the students at SIS were black, Latino, and Middle Eastern kids, mostly from working class and poor families. That year, like the year before and the year before that, the school was shrinking. The principal, Jillian Juman, was worried. Yeah, so the last two years, we had 30 students in our sixth grade class. And so we really have room for 100. And so numbers, I think, are hard. Ms. Juman started to reach out to families from the neighborhood, inviting them to please come take a look. Parents started showing up for tours of SIS, mostly groups of white parents. Ms. Juman was thrilled and relieved. She walked parents through the building, saying, stop me anytime if anyone has any questions. Really, anything; I want you to feel comfortable. And Ms. Juman says they did have questions, mostly about the poor test scores. That was fair. Ms. Juman expected those questions. She did not expect the other set of questions she got a lot from parents. Is there weapons? Is there — you know, are you scanning? Are you a scanning school, because kids are dangerous and they have weapons? I’ve heard that there’s — Scanning, like metal detectors? Right. I heard there’s fights and those kinds of things. I don’t know what school you’re talking about. I have never heard of that incident ever happening, ever. So the fears of what this building is and what this building has represented has transcended itself. There’s a different story of International Studies outside this building. How much of that do you think is racism? I think our entire society is fearful of the unknown. Excellent principal answer. Principal Juman is black, by the way. She needed these parents. Schools get money per student. A shrinking school means a shrinking budget. Ms. Juman was worried if this continued, the middle school could be in danger of being shut down by the city. SIS is in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. Leafy streets, brownstones, it’s a wealthy, white neighborhood that’s gotten wealthier and whiter in the last decade. But white families were not sending their kids to SIS. Ms. Juman told these parents, choose SIS. We’re turning things around. We’re in the process of bringing in a new, prestigious International Baccalaureate curriculum, renovating the library. Here’s the new, gorgeous yard. It’s an excellent school. The parents seemed interested, but I believe that might have had just as much to do with what was happening outside of the school as what they were seeing inside the building. Sure, so my name is Rob Hansen, and I’m a parent. So we were — the middle school process is interesting. Rob lives nearby SAS, but he had never heard of the school. You know, probably eight school — In his district, Rob could choose from 11 middle schools. The majority of white families sent their kids to the same three schools. Rob’s white. Those were the schools he’d heard of, and those were the schools he toured. And it also had space.
