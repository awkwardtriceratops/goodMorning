Live Updates: Democrats Present a Familiar, and Moderate, Face at Their Convention<br></h1><p id="artcont">Ratings for the virtual convention held steady on its second, less-starry night. At the convention’s midpoint, a liberal and diverse party with older, moderate leaders. The Affordable Care Act, and Trump’s push to repeal it, become a focus at the Democratic convention. The Supreme Court will hear a suit seeking to overturn Obamacare a week after the election. Night 3 of the convention features high-stakes speeches. Here’s how to watch. The Democrats approved a platform setting out the party’s agenda. Elizabeth Warren, who speaks tonight, has challenged Wall Street. What will that mean for her future? Democrats want to know how a Trump megadonor became postmaster general. TRANSCRIPT “Welcome.” “Welcome.” “Welcome —” “— to the second night —” “— of the Democratic National Convention.” “This is a different kind of convention.” “This year —” “— all of us are on the stage.” “And we’ve got a lot to say.” “The presidential election is the world’s most important job interview. At the end, we hire a leader to help us solve problems, create opportunities and give our kids better tomorrows. That’s a tall order this year, with the Covid-19 outbreak on a path to killing 200,000 people and destroying millions of jobs and small businesses. How did Donald Trump respond? Only when Covid exploded in even more states did he encourage people to wear masks. By then, many more were dying. When asked about the surge in deaths, he shrugged and said, ‘It is what it is.’ At a time like this. the Oval Office should be a command center. Instead, it’s a storm center. There’s only chaos. Just one thing never changes: his determination to deny responsibility and shift the blame. The buck never stops there.” “Under our procedural rules, two Democratic candidates submitted nominating documents to our convention secretary for the office of president of the United States: Senator Bernie Sanders and Vice President Joe Biden.” “In a time when millions of people in the United States are looking for deep systemic solutions to our crises of mass evictions, unemployment and lack of health care, en el espíritu del pueblo, and out of a love for all people, I hereby second the nomination of Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont for president of the United States of America.” “I take powerful people up on my elevator all the time. When they get off, they go to their important meetings. Me, I just head back to the lobby. But in the short time I spent with Joe Biden, I could tell he really saw me, that he actually cared. That’s why I nominate my friend Joe Biden as the next president of the United States.” “We’ll now proceed to a roll call by states.” “As an Arizona Latina, I proudly cast our votes: 29 for Bernie Sanders and 51 for our next president, Joe Biden.” “The calamari comeback state of Rhode Island casts one vote for Bernie Sanders and 34 votes for the next president, Joe Biden.” “Delaware is proud to cast its 32 votes for our favorite son and our next president —” “— our friend, Delaware’s Joe Biden.” [music, “Celebration” by Kool and the Gang] [cheering] “I’m pleased to announce that Vice President Joe Biden has officially been nominated by the Democratic Party as our candidate for president of the United States.” “Thank you very, very much from the bottom of my heart. Thank you all. It means the world to me and my family.” “Before Donald Trump, we used to talk about American exceptionalism. The only thing exceptional about the incoherent Trump foreign policy is that it has made our nation more isolated than ever before.” “Our country needs a commander in chief who takes care of our troops in the same way he would his own family. For Joe Biden, that doesn’t need teaching. It comes from the experience he shares with millions of military families: sending his beloved son off to war and praying to God he would come home safe.” “You know, motherhood came to me in a way I never expected. I fell in love with a man and two little boys standing in the wreckage of unthinkable loss, mourning a wife and mother, a daughter and sister. How do you make a broken family whole? The same way you make a nation whole: with love and understanding, and with small acts of kindness, with bravery, with unwavering faith. The burdens we carry are heavy, and we need someone with strong shoulders. I know that if we entrust this nation to Joe, he will do for your family what he did for ours: bring us together and make us whole, carry us forward in our time of need, keep the promise of America for all of us.” “Great job. God love you, I don’t know how you ...” For all of the speakers and images showcasing diversity, and the remarks emphasizing progressive goals, another reality is clear at this midway point in the four-day Democratic convention: This is a party dominated by a 77-year-old white male and leaders from the past with whom he is comfortable, holding to a platform and a campaign that is more centrist and establishment-heavy than left-wing. Of the eight political figures who got the most speaking time Tuesday, only Sally Q. Yates, the 59-year-old former acting attorney general, is younger than 69 years old. Only Colin Powell, 83, isn’t white, and Ms. Yates was the only woman who didn’t appear in a capacity as a political spouse. That will shift somewhat tonight, when Senator Elizabeth Warren and Speaker Nancy Pelosi speak, and major roles go to Kamala Harris, the vice-presidential nominee, and former President Barack Obama. But it won’t feel like the future-oriented convention of 2008, when a 47-year-old Mr. Obama minted a new image and new coalition for the Democratic Party. On the first two nights of the convention, the energy embodied by party’s progressive movement was shoehorned into two speakers: Senator Bernie Sanders, who on Monday urged his followers to swallow their disappointment and back Joseph R. Biden Jr., and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who in her 90-second Tuesday slot made a pitch for “a movement striving to recognize and repair the wounds of racial injustice, colonization, misogyny and homophobia.” By keeping Ms. Ocasio-Cortez from a prime speaking slot — and dividing the keynote address between 17 young-but-moderate officials — the Biden campaign focused its convention on the political middle, avoiding obvious land mines for the Trump campaign to exploit. Even Mr. Biden’s selection of Ms. Harris as his running mate was an exercise in tapping a successor who can shepherd the party’s next generation without moving it too far left. Ms. Harris, though she briefly endorsed Mr. Sanders’s single-payer health care plans, has a long history as a pragmatist. Democrats certainly hope the combination of Ms. Harris on the ticket and the prime speaking slots given to Barack and Michelle Obama — beloved figures, but also leaders from the past — spurs Black turnout that sagged in battleground states in 2016. But the key to victory may be holding onto gains in the suburbs, where many women and longtime Republican voters are watching the Democratic Party’s older, moderate leaders and envisioning a return to a less chaotic time. — Reid J. Epstein TRANSCRIPT Hello, America. My name is Ady Barkan, and I am speaking to you through this computer voice because I have been paralyzed by a mysterious illness called A.L.S. Like so many of you, I have experienced the ways our health care system is fundamentally broken: enormous costs, denied claims, dehumanizing treatment when we are most in need. Since my shocking diagnosis, I have traveled the country meeting countless patients like me, demanding more of our representatives in our democracy. Today we are witnessing the tragic consequences of our failing health care system. In the midst of a pandemic, nearly 100 million Americans do not have sufficient health insurance, and even good insurance does not cover essential needs like long term care. Our loved ones are dying in unsafe nursing homes, our nurses are overwhelmed and unprotected, and our essential workers are treated as dispensable. We live in the richest country in history, and yet we do not guarantee this most basic human right. Everyone living in America should get the health care they need, regardless of their employment status or ability to pay. Even during this terrible crisis, Donald Trump and Republican politicians are trying to take away millions of people’s health insurance. With the existential threat of another four years of this president, we all have a profound obligation to act — not only to vote, but to make sure that our friends, family and neighbors vote as well. We must elect Joe Biden. Each of us must be a hero for our communities, for our country. And then, with a compassionate and intelligent president, we must act together and put on his desk a bill that guarantees us all the health care we deserve. Amid a pandemic that has highlighted the importance of medical care even as millions of Americans who lost their jobs also lost their insurance, some of the most emotionally resonant moments of the second night of the Democratic convention came in discussions of health care. It is an issue that Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sought to lay claim to, by invoking both his fight alongside President Barack Obama to pass the Affordable Care Act and his own history dealing with suffering and loss. One segment showed the candidate listening as supporters described their ordeals in the health care system. The father of a 4-year-old boy in Arizona talked about how his son’s heart transplant was covered by the Affordable Care Act. A former longtime Republican voter, Jeff Jeans, described putting off seeing a doctor for his laryngitis because he was uninsured, only to find out that he had cancer. He said that he signed up for coverage under the act and “that same day, they started my chemo and radiation, and it saved my life.” A video reminded viewers that Mr. Biden “was sworn into the Senate next to a hospital bed” after his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash and his two sons were injured, and that in 2015 he lost his older son Beau to brain cancer. “I remember thinking as Beau lay dying in bed, ” Mr. Biden said in a video, “and thinking to myself, ‘What in God’s name would I do if the doctor said I’m sorry, you’ve outrun your insurance, you’ve reached your cap, suffer the last few months of your life on your own.’” Another clip spotlighted Ady Barkan, the well-known progressive activist who suffers from A.L.S. and is a supporter of “Medicare for all,” which Mr. Biden does not support. Mr. Barkan, whose disease now requires him to speak through a computerized voice, played up some of the common ground he has with Mr. Biden: their opposition to President Trump’s efforts to dismantle the A.C.A. “Even during this terrible crisis, Donald Trump and Republican politicians are trying to take away millions of people’s health insurance,” Mr. Barkan said. — Andy Newman The Supreme Court announced Wednesday that it would hear arguments in the latest case seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act — one backed by President Trump — on Nov. 10, a week after the presidential election. Democrats have seized on Mr. Trump’s support of the case, brought in 2018 by Republican state officials, as an election issue and have repeatedly mentioned it at their convention this week. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee and former vice president under Barack Obama, has campaigned on protecting and improving the Affordable Care Act. The law was the signature domestic achievement of the Obama presidency and has led to millions more Americans having health coverage even as the cost remains out of reach for others. The suit awaiting the Supreme Court argues that when Congress in 2017 zeroed out the law’s penalty for failing to obtain health insurance, it rendered the entire law unconstitutional. The Trump administration sided with the state officials, arguing that the rest of the 2010 law could not survive without the penalty, also called the individual mandate. A federal judge in Texas agreed late in 2018 but postponed the effects of his ruling pending an appeal. An appeals court late last year agreed that the mandate had become unconstitutional but declined to rule on the rest of the health law, asking the lower court to reconsider the question in more detail. That led the defendants — Democratic states and the House of Representatives, which intervened in the case — to ask the Supreme Court to hear the appeal. — Abby Goodnough Joseph R. Biden Jr. is the “presumptive” presidential nominee, no more, after a pretaped rendition of the traditional delegate roll call Tuesday night put him over the 1,991-vote threshold for official nomination. Now the convention moves on to the big-name moments that will probably define it. Wednesday’s prime-time lineup is the closest this variety Zoom-call version of a national political conclave has come to being must-see TV. The night kicks off with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Then Hillary Clinton makes a much-anticipated return to the party’s center stage. The final hour begins with the vice-presidential acceptance speech by Senator Kamala Harris and concludes with former President Barack Obama. The convention will air tonight from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern time. Kerry Washington is the M.C. There are several ways to watch: The Times will stream the full convention, with live analysis from our reporters and real-time highlights from the speeches. You can download our iOS or Android app and turn on notifications to be alerted when our live analysis starts. The official livestream is here. It will also be available on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Twitch. ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News will air the convention from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. each night.

Streams will be available on Apple TV, Roku and Amazon Fire TV by searching “Democratic National Convention” or “2020 DNC,” and on Amazon Prime Video by searching “DNC.” The convention will air on AT&T U-verse (Channels 212 and 1212) and AT&T DirectTV (Channel 201). It will also air on Comcast Xfinity Flex and Comcast X1 (say “DNC” into your voice remote). You can watch on a PlayStation 4 or PSVR through the Littlstar app. If you have an Alexa device, you can say “Alexa, play the Democratic National Convention.” — Glenn Thrush and Maggie Astor Democrats officially approved a new party platform on Tuesday night, outlining a sweeping set of policies on key issues including health care, climate change and the economy. But the platform also reinforced divisions among the party’s moderates and its liberal wing, which has expressed disappointment that the official Democratic agenda does not support “Medicare for all,” the universal, single-payer health care proposal championed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont that has become a pillar of the progressive movement. Some Democrats refused to vote for the platform as a form of protest. A largely symbolic document, the party platform does not contain specific legislation or binding commitments. Taken as a whole, however, it provides a broad look at the party’s agenda and the principles and values that Democrats, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., embrace. Here are some of the planks: Making public colleges and universities tuition-free for students whose families earn less than $125,000 Eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 and achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for all new buildings by 2030 Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026 A path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, fast-tracking the process for workers who have been essential during the pandemic The platform was written by a drafting committee that included members from the party’s progressive and more moderate wings. The Democratic National Committee’s platform committee then voted on the platform — this year in a recorded roll call via a secure website — before sending it to all of the delegates who voted remotely on whether to approve it.  — Sydney Ember and Matt Stevens The television audience for the Democratic National Convention held steady on Tuesday with about 18.2 million people tuning in live for the second night, down only slightly from Monday’s opener, according to Nielsen. Those numbers will be reassuring to the Democrats producing a highly unusual televised spectacle without the customary you-are-there live coverage, although TV viewership overall was still down roughly 25 percent from 2016. Network executives attribute the decline in part to the virtual nature of this year’s event and the rise in popularity of streaming services. The Nielsen figures do not reflect online or streaming views, which are difficult to credibly measure. Younger people in particular prefer to watch the convention online, though traditional TV networks tend to attract the older voters that Democrats are seeking to win over. Tuesday’s top-rated network, MSNBC, increased its audience from Monday, drawing 5.24 million viewers between 10 p.m. and 11:15 p.m. MSNBC aired a mostly unfiltered broadcast of the virtual roll call and speeches by former Secretary of State John Kerry and Jill Biden. CNN attracted the most viewers between ages 25 and 54, the most coveted advertising demographic in the TV industry. Fox News’s ratings for its convention coverage fell below its prime-time average, but the cable channel still outranked CBS in total viewers between 10 and 11:15 p.m. — Michael M. Grynbaum The Trump campaign kicked off its convention response with a flashy ad buy placed at the top of YouTube’s home page for a 96-hour stretch, seeking to bracket the virtual Democratic National Convention on the most popular video platform on the internet. It also bought a lot of eyes. Since the pricey campaign launched on Tuesday morning, five new ads in heavy rotation on YouTube have garnered more than 40 million views. The Trump campaign’s nightly shows and broadcasts, by comparison, have barely topped 100,000 views on the platform. The five ads run the gamut of attacks against Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, and have marked the return of the Trump campaign’s varied — and sometimes inconsistent — criticisms of the former vice president. One ad falsely depicts moments of violence from largely peaceful protests earlier this year as evidence of a violent “radical leftist mob,” and edits in statements from Democratic officials and members of the news media defending the protests. The ad is a return to a focus on policing issues for the Trump campaign, which spent more than $25 million on the topic earlier this summer. Two other ads take issue with Mr. Biden’s age, selectively editing videos and using popular memes to question his cognitive state, with one ad adopting a campy, faux-horror movie aesthetic. The campaign had run similar memes on Facebook earlier this year, but it has since stopped. — Nick Corasaniti Elizabeth Warren’s appearance tonight comes a week after Wall Street sighed in relief when Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his vice-presidential running mate instead of the longtime critic of the financial industry. But there’s a catch, according to today’s DealBook newsletter. Ms. Warren’s ability to influence a Biden administration may be stronger now than if she were to become vice president, where she would be more directly limited by the wants of her boss. And while progressive Democrats have rallied behind Ms. Harris, they’ll likely expect something in return. That may mean giving Ms. Warren a spot in the administration, making her speech tonight a showcase — or a tryout, of sorts — of the ideas and approach that she would promote during a Biden presidency. An appointment to Treasury secretary would be a natural fit for the senator, who has made financial regulation a priority (although she is seen as a long shot). If named to the role, Ms. Warren would emphasize Main Street over Wall Street, push for higher taxes on the wealthy and promote spending over fiscal restraint, experts say. Even if she isn’t nominated for the role, Mr. Biden would probably turn to her for advice, especially on priorities for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency she helped create. “She understands financial regulation as a tool to bring about better outcomes,” said Sarah Bloom Raskin, a law professor at Duke and a former deputy secretary at the Treasury Department. There are other jobs a Biden administration could offer her, like attorney general, where she would oversee investigations into the market power of big technology companies, or a bespoke position like a regulatory czar. But some would prefer not to give up Ms. Warren’s seat in the Senate, depending on the balance of power in the chamber. But before any of these decisions can be made, of course, there’s the small matter of whether Mr. Biden can win the election in November. — Lauren Hirsch Shortly before the 2016 election, President Barack Obama told supporters that he would consider it “a personal insult” if America chose a bombastic reality television star who trafficked in racist conspiracy theories and stood against everything that he had spent eight years building. America did it anyway. “This stings,” Mr. Obama confessed afterward. Four years later, Mr. Obama returns to the national stage on Wednesday night seeking vindication. After watching President Trump systematically demolish many of his achievements, Mr. Obama has almost as much at stake in this year’s campaign as his former vice president and his party’s 2020 presidential nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr., does — a second chance to redeem his legacy and prove to history that Mr. Trump’s election was an anomaly, not a permanent repudiation. On the line is not just the opportunity to restore programs and international agreements that Mr. Trump abandoned and bolster those that remain threatened, but also to rewrite the narrative about America and its values according to Mr. Obama. The story line that Mr. Obama and his allies promoted for years was that his election as the first Black president and a leader of a new generation demonstrated a fundamental change in the country. Instead, he left behind a nation that, on some level at least, embraced his polar opposite. “Each president kind of begets the next guy,” William M. Daley, who served as Mr. Obama’s White House chief of staff, said in an interview before Mr. Obama’s convention speech, to be delivered in front of the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia. “He’s got to clarify what about him didn’t beget this guy. Why did the eight years not change the country when we thought in ’08 things were different?”  — Peter Baker To Krystina François, a Haitian-American executive director of a Miami nonprofit organization, Kamala Harris is a lot like her, a first-generation daughter of immigrants pursuing the American dream. To Nicole Sanchez, a Chicana consultant in Berkeley, Calif., Ms. Harris is an ambitious woman who listened to the same 1990s hip-hop that she did growing up. And to Carol Kim, an Asian-American union organizer in San Diego, Ms. Harris is the first woman on a national stage whom she can point to and say to her daughter, “She is one of us.” In Ms. Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate and California senator, each of the women said they saw someone familiar. And as Ms. Harris, whose parents immigrated from Jamaica and India, reaches the highest echelons of American politics, dozens of women of color said they also view her success as their own. “How could you not see this as a victory?” Afrah Hamin, 66, said of the announcement last week by Joseph R. Biden Jr. that he had chosen Ms. Harris as his running mate. In interviews with dozens of Black, Latina and Asian-American women, many said that in Ms. Harris’s life, they recognized both her triumphs and the challenges that come with living in a country wrestling with its history of discrimination. “It’s the twin devils of racism and sexism,” said Ms. Sanchez, 47, who lives near Ms. Harris’s childhood school. “We are told our whole lives to educate ourselves and work hard — God forbid it actually works, we get told we’re asking for too much.” — Audra D. S. Burch, Jennifer Medina and Evan Nicole Brown During their convention, Democrats have presented a unified front on racial justice, declaring that the status quo is not acceptable. But beneath the surface lies broad disagreement over policing, with the reform-oriented proposals of Joseph R. Biden Jr. falling well short of progressive activists’ demands. The gap was evident in a line Mr. Biden delivered during a discussion on the convention’s opening night: “Most cops are good, but the fact is, the bad ones need to be identified and prosecuted.” His words struck many activists as discordant at a moment when the police killing of George Floyd has spurred nationwide calls for rethinking law enforcement. Progressives say they see unprecedented momentum to transform policing that they can’t let slip away in an election year. “What I’m concerned about is the continued conversation about it being a few bad apples as opposed to systemic racism in the system,” said Jamaal Bowman, the Bronx Democrat who ousted the longtime Representative Eliot Engel in a June primary. “Part of our issue is recognizing that racism is not an individual-to-individual problem, it’s our system. It’s part of America’s DNA because we’ve never reckoned with our history of slavery.” — Reid J. Epstein and John Eligon Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, called on the Postal Service board of governors on Wednesday to release information about the selection process that led to Louis DeJoy becoming postmaster general in May, charging that the board had denied access to the information. The agency has blocked lawmakers from questioning Russell Reynolds, the firm involved in selecting Mr. DeJoy, by refusing to release the firm from a nondisclosure agreement, Mr. Schumer said. Mr. Schumer said his office had sought a briefing from Kimberly Archer, a leader of the firm’s global nonprofit practice, so “Congress could satisfy its oversight obligations to better understand the selection of Mr. DeJoy,” who is a former C.E.O. of a transportation-logistics company that does business with the Postal Service. In July, the board had deemed much of the information sought by lawmakers to be confidential, Mr. Schumer said. After budget cuts to the Postal Service slowed mail delivery, leading to fears that millions of people who plan to vote by mail this November because of the pandemic could be disenfranchised — especially after President Trump’s repeated criticisms of the practice — Mr. DeJoy said this week that further changes would be suspended until after the election. But Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said in a statement Wednesday that his “alleged pause is wholly insufficient and does not reverse damage already wreaked.” Separately, close to 100 House Democrats on Wednesday called for Mr. DeJoy’s removal, writing to the agency’s board of governors that he “has already done considerable damage to the institution and we believe his conflicts of interest are insurmountable.” — Emily Cochrane Doug Emhoff, who emerged as a fervent professional spouse during Senator Kamala Harris’s thwarted campaign for the Democratic nomination for president, is a serious contender to be the country’s first-ever Second Gentleman. Only two women besides Ms. Harris have ever been nominated for the vice presidency from major parties, so Mr. Emhoff finds himself in a rarefied club. His predecessors include John Zaccaro, a real estate developer whose complicated financial arrangements and reluctance to release his tax returns tarnished his wife, Geraldine Ferraro, Walter F. Mondale’s running mate in the 1984 election. And there was Todd Palin, the rough-and-ready snowmobile-racing “first dude” of Alaska, whose wife, Sarah Palin, was the running mate of Senator John McCain in 2008, hampering his candidacy. (The Palins are now divorced.) Mr. Emhoff,  a partner at the law firm DLA Piper who specializes in media, sports and entertainment litigation, and Ms. Harris, both now 55, married in 2014 — his second marriage, her first. Husbands of high-profile candidates walk a tricky line, required to exude both alpha-male independence and second-wheel supportiveness, said Lori Poloni-Staudinger, a professor in the politics and international affairs department at Northern Arizona University whose work focuses on women and politics. “There’s a fascination with women candidates’ domestic lives that we don’t see with men’s lives,” she said. Mr. Emhoff has taken a leave of absence from his job, apparently mindful about avoiding any possible conflicts of interest; the firm declined to comment. Throwing himself with unabashed enthusiasm into the project, Ms. Harris’s husband has produced a stream of social media posts following one basic theme: I love this woman. “I think he is having a good time,” said Aaron H. Jacoby, an old friend and former law partner of Mr. Emhoff. Mr. Emhoff befriended other candidates’ spouses in the primaries, to the point where he and Chasten Buttigieg spent one debate texting emojis to each other as their spouses battled it out onstage.  — Sarah Lyall Amazon this week removed shirts from its online marketplace that used a derogatory word to refer to Senator Kamala Harris of California, the Democratic nominee for vice president, the company said on Wednesday. The shirts featured a fictitious campaign logo for Ms. Harris and Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, that referred to Ms. Harris using a slur associated with promiscuity. “All sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account,” an Amazon spokeswoman said in an email. “These products have been removed.” USA Today, which first reported on the step taken by Amazon, said that one seller, The Oxygen Bandit, sold T-shirts, tank tops, hoodies and sweatshirts with the phrase on its Amazon store. As of Wednesday afternoon, the store still had other products available mocking Mr. Biden, Ms. Harris and their campaign. Ms. Harris, a former attorney general of California and former San Francisco district attorney,  is the first Black woman and the first candidate of Indian descent to be on a major party’s presidential ticket. But Since Mr. Biden announced Ms. Harris as his running mate last week, she has been forced to endure attacks on her heritage and gender. Last week, President Trump perpetuated a racist conspiracy theory that is rampant among some of his followers: that Ms. Harris was not eligible for the vice presidency or presidency because her parents were immigrants. That assertion is false. Ms. Harris is eligible to serve. — Neil Vigdor Updated Aug. 19, 2020 </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
