Trump says he will declare victory ‘when there is victory, if there is victory.’ Nearing the finish line in Scranton, Pa., Biden says, ‘You got to run through the tape, man.’ Election-Day legal skirmishes began in Pennsylvania as Republicans pressed on two fronts. In battleground states lines at the polls were long, but many said the wait times were manageable. Statehouse seats are up for grabs — and with them, great power. ‘Keep calm and let them count,’ the Trump administration’s cybersecurity chief says. As Democrats try to retake the Senate, Susan Collins of Maine fights for her political life.  Voters went to the polls on Tuesday to write the final chapter of a presidential campaign that has been like no other, amid a coronavirus pandemic that has claimed more than 230,000 lives in the United States, cost millions of Americans their jobs and upended daily life and Election Day itself. More than 100 million people had already cast their ballots before the day even dawned — taking advantage of states’ efforts to make voting safer during the pandemic. Among the early voters were President Trump and his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who both decided to forgo the traditional Election Day photo op at the polls. Battleground states including Michigan and Pennsylvania were making news on the eve of the election not just for 11th-hour campaign stops, but for setting one-day records for new coronavirus cases. Contrary to Mr. Trump’s repeated insistence that the nation is “rounding the turn” when it comes to the virus, the U.S. is seeing more new infections than ever. Dr. Deborah L. Birx, who helps lead the Trump administration’s coronavirus response, delivered a stark private warning to White House officials on Monday, telling them that the pandemic was entering a new and “deadly phase” that demands a more aggressive approach. Dr. Birx predicted that the United States would soon see days when the number of new cases exceeded 100,000, and she warned against the type of rallies that Mr. Trump has been holding, in which many attendees pack in close together without wearing masks. The failure to contain the virus has decimated whole industries — costing thousands of jobs in travel, leisure, dining and entertainment. There are now five million more people unemployed than when Mr. Trump took office in January 2017. And the recent recovery is showing signs of stalling, as hopes begin to fade that many jobs lost to pandemic would return swiftly. Hundreds of thousands of new jobless claims pour in every week; 2.4 million people have been unemployed for more than six months. Eight million people have slipped into poverty since May, according to researchers at Columbia University. Millions of students are not taking classes in person, as many of the nation’s largest school districts are still offering remote instruction or a hybrid that combines some in-person schooling with classes from home. And with the United States still suffering one of the worst outbreaks in the world, travelers have found a U.S. passport is not always welcomed anymore. The nation remains divided — and buffeted by fears of unrest and violence. As Election Day dawned, the sight of plywood being put up over windows from Washington to New York to Los Angeles sent an ominous sign. Amid that backdrop, both campaigns have sought to set expectations — but not in the way campaigns typically do. The Biden campaign is seeking to remind people that it is highly likely that the winner of the election will not be known tonight, with many key states indicating that releasing official results could take several days. And Mr. Trump has repeatedly made baseless claims seeking to undermine the integrity of the election, with most polls showing him trailing Mr. Biden. But even in the face of the added strains, there were long lines of eager voters ready to render their final verdict on the race in person, collect their “I voted” stickers and to walk out with the pride of taking part in a democratic process.  — Michael Cooper and Patricia Cohen   TRANSCRIPT We’ve been under a phony, fake hoax investigation for three years. Nothing but bad and really corrupt publicity from these people. And I say, I wonder what the difference would have been had it been legit — right — had it been legit, and it turned out to be just the opposite. They were the ones that committed the crimes, not us. But I wonder what it would have been — probably would have been a little bit easier. But you know the good news? We’re going to win anyway. And you know I have like five of these to do today, so let’s get going. [cheering] And I appreciate you being here. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. We are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. As Election Day dawned, President Trump said Tuesday morning in an interview on “Fox & Friends” that he would declare victory “when there is victory, if there is victory.” Mr. Trump made the remarks when he was asked when he planned to declare victory — and whether he intended to declare it if early returns showed him leading, as some reports had suggested he might. “I think we will have victory,’’ a gravelly voiced Mr. Trump said. “I think the polls are, you know, suppression polls. And I think we will have victory. But only when there is victory. You know, there is no reason to play games.” At another point in the interview, when one of the hosts tried to get Mr. Trump to respond to criticism from his predecessor, President Obama, about the safety of Mr. Trump’s rallies amid a pandemic, the president instead started attacking Fox News. The network “has changed a lot,” Mr. Trump said, falsely saying they’ve “had Democrats on more than Republicans.” He complained: “Look, it’s different. I’m not complaining, I’m just telling people. But it’s one of the biggest differences this season compared to last.” Mr. Trump sounded tired, after spending all day Monday flying from rally to rally. He spent much of his last day on the campaign trail attacking the Supreme Court, accusing it of putting “our country in danger” by ruling to allow Pennsylvania to continue accepting absentee ballots after Election Day, at least for the time being. In Kenosha, Wis., the fourth of five rallies across four states, Mr. Trump told a crowd, without basis, that the justices had made a “political” decision that would lead to cheating by his opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. His comments followed an angry tweet in which he charged — without providing any evidence — that the court’s decision would “allow rampant and unchecked cheating” and “induce violence in the streets.” Twitter quickly flagged the president’s assertions as potentially false, saying that “some or all of the content shared in this tweet is disputed and might be misleading.” The president’s remarks in Wisconsin echoed his comments earlier, in Avoca, Pa., where he had suggested cryptically that the Supreme Court decision could be “physically dangerous” without explaining what he meant. Mr. Trump has for months falsely claimed that mail-in ballots are subject to rampant fraud despite overwhelming evidence that it is not true. In the last days of the campaign, Mr. Trump has focused intensely on Pennsylvania, where Republicans had legally challenged the state’s plan to accept absentee ballots for up to three days after Election Day. On Friday, the Supreme Court denied a plea from Republicans in the state asking the court to fast-track a decision on whether election officials could continue receiving absentee ballots for three days after Nov. 3. The justices said the court could revisit the decision after the election. — Maggie Haberman, Annie Karni, Michael D. Shear and Michael Cooper ON THE TRAIL Joseph R. Biden Jr. returned to his Pennsylvania birthplace, Scranton, on the morning of Election Day, addressing supporters outside a carpenters’ union hall and visiting his childhood home. “It’s good to be home,” the former vice president said at a canvass kickoff, wearing a mask and speaking through a bullhorn with Biden-Harris stickers on it. “Scranton is where I learned, like you did, all my basic values.” As he chatted with supporters, he used a track and field analogy about finishing the race: “You got to run through the tape, man. You got to go all the way through the tape.” Mr. Biden also paid a visit to his childhood home, where he signed a message on the living room wall: “From this house to the White House with the grace of God.” “I watch you all the time,” Anne Kearns, who lives in the house now, told him. “I’m so proud of you.” Mr. Biden had started the day attending a Catholic church near his home in Delaware, with his wife, Jill, and two of their grandchildren, then visiting the cemetery where several members of his family are buried, including his son Beau, his first wife, Neilia, and their daughter, Naomi, according to a pool report. The Bidens then left for Pennsylvania, where Mr. Biden has focused the last days of his campaign. In addition to Scranton, he was to rally voters in Philadelphia. He plans to return to Delaware, which he represented in the U.S. Senate for decades, to address the nation tonight. Mr. Biden, his team has made clear, plans to speak regardless of the status of the race and how President Trump responds to the developments unfolding. Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, said on Tuesday that Mr. Biden, who has led Mr. Trump in the polls in several battleground states in the homestretch of the campaign, had many pathways to the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the election. She made the case that he could win even if he lost both Pennsylvania and Florida, another electoral vote-rich state where his campaign has spent significant time, though it is clear that losing Pennsylvania in particular would be a major risk and disappointment for the campaign. “We feel like we have a very good understanding of when the vote’s coming in, how it’s coming in and also our expectations of what we hope to see,” she said She was joined at the briefing by Bob Bauer, a former White House counsel who is helping to lead the Biden campaign’s election protection efforts. Mr. Bauer said that “by and large, voting is proceeding smoothly.” Tuesday is the third straight day that Mr. Biden, who lived in Scranton until he was 10, has campaigned in Pennsylvania. Beyond Scranton’s personal significance to Mr. Biden, northeastern Pennsylvania is a critical area in a state that Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump are battling over. Mr. Trump excelled in traditionally Democratic areas in northeastern Pennsylvania in the 2016 election, when he won the state by less than one percentage point. — Thomas Kaplan, Katie Glueck and Michael Cooper More than 100 million Americans had cast their ballots even before the polls opened on Election Day, a record early vote that showed that many people had taken advantage of the changes many states made to voting safer during the pandemic and suggested that the nation was on pace to set a record for turnout.   As the polls prepared to open on Tuesday, a staggering 100.3 million ballots had already been cast, according to the U.S. Elections Project, a nonpartisan website run by Michael P. McDonald, a University of Florida professor who compiles data from across the nation. That number is nearly three-quarters of the total of over 138 million votes cast in the 2016 election. Several states have already recorded more votes than they did during the whole 2016 election, including Texas, Washington, Montana and Hawaii, and several battleground states, including Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, were nearing their 2016 totals. The Trump and Biden campaigns were sifting through early vote data to try to figure out which potential supporters had yet to cast ballots, so they could target them during last-minute get-out-the-vote efforts. Political analysts and opinion polls have suggested that Republican voters are more likely to vote on the day of the election, while Democrats are more likely to vote early, especially by mail. So some analysts were looking at the early data to try to divine whether Democrats had built up enough of an early vote lead in key states to withstand a big Republican turnout on Election Day. Of course, no one will know until the election is over and all the votes are in. Here is a look at where things stand in several key states, according to data compiled by the elections project. In Florida, a perennially close state, Democrats built up a huge lead with mailed-in votes only to see Republicans eat into it by casting more early in-person votes. As Election Day dawned, registered Democrats had cast 39.1 percent of the early vote, registered Republicans 37.9 percent, and the rest were cast by voters with no party affiliation or who belonged to minor parties. In North Carolina, Democrats have cast 37.4 percent of the early vote, Republicans 31.7 percent, and the rest were cast by voters with no party affiliation or who belonged to minor parties. And in Nevada, Democrats have cast 39.5 percent of the early vote, Republicans 36.1 percent, and the rest were cast by voters with no party affiliation or who belonged to minor parties. More than 100 million ballots have already been cast in the general election. More Democrats are voting early by mail than Republicans. — Michael Cooper The first legal skirmishes of Election Day broke out soon after polls opened in Pennsylvania on Tuesday. The Trump campaign pressed complaints that election workers in Philadelphia were not giving their observers enough access to ballot-counting areas, and Republicans moved in a suburban county just outside the city to stop officials from giving voters an additional opportunity to vote after their mail ballots were rejected for having errors. The moves were in keeping with the Trump campaign’s open effort to disqualify ballots in Democratic strongholds of competitive states. In a tweet, the Trump campaign’s Election Day director, Mike Roman, posted a photo of a cavernous ballot-counting room set up inside the Philadelphia Convention Center showing metal barricades that were set up several yards away from the work stations for those tabulating the votes. “NOW they’re keeping our poll watchers so far from the counting tables there’s NO WAY to ACTUALLY observe,” Mr. Roman wrote. “What are they hiding?? THIS MUST STOP!!!” As the morning went on, Mr. Roman followed with tweets warning that Democrats were seeking to “steal” the election in Philadelphia. The developments came soon after President Trump predicted on Fox News that “Philadelphia will be a disaster.” In a brief interview, Mr. Roman said, “We’re just making sure the rules are followed; we follow the rules the way everyone else should.” In suburban Montgomery County, just outside Philadelphia, Republicans filed a complaint this morning arguing against the county’s efforts to contact voters whose mail ballots were rejected because of errors and get them to cast provisional ballots. The complaint said that the county was causing illegal “re-votes.” Anticipating such a suit, Pennsylvania’s top election official, Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, a Democrat, had said on Monday, “There’s nothing in the law that would prohibit a county from reaching out to a voter because they had a ballot bounce back or an application bounce back.” — Jim Rutenberg and Nick Corasaniti Outside polling places in Philadelphia and Milwaukee, long lines of voters toting mugs of coffee and scrolling through their phones seemed to move swiftly, relieving fears of exorbitant wait times. Nearly 100 million people across the United States had already cast their ballots as the polls opened Tuesday morning, though many held out so they could vote on Election Day. “I’m glad to see people out and excited about America and the freedoms we enjoy here,” said Carrie Wiza, 64, a Trump supporter who waited in a line of about 100 people outside St. John Neumann Catholic Parish in Waukesha, a city just outside Milwaukee. In West Philadelphia, two dozen people waited outside a recreation center to vote. Many said they were relieved the election would soon be over. “At times it’s gotten the best of me, and I find myself obsessively watching politics, and trying to be aware of what’s going on as it relates to me and my family and my community,” said Damen Williams, 40, who trains service dogs for disabled veterans. In parts of North Carolina, the robust early voting efforts meant no lines outside polling stations in Orange, Durham and Alamance counties on Tuesday morning. One poll worker in Orange County said there were only 600 people — less than 20 percent of the total voters in the precinct — who had not yet cast their ballots. In Michigan, where 30,000 poll workers were recruited to help deal with an Election Day crush, only a dozen workers needed to help in cities like Pontiac and Grand Rapids. In Fulton County, Ga., the state’s most populous county, officials had to deal with a few 11th-hour problems involving the delivery of voting equipment. Still, officials said that polling places were firing on all cylinders by Tuesday morning. At the Central Park Recreation Center, in Atlanta’s fast-evolving Old Fourth Ward neighborhood, about a dozen people had lined up before 7 a.m., when the polls were officially opened. Some said they chose to line up early because of the catastrophe the state’s elections system suffered during the June 9 primary, when voters spent hours in line. Jerry Hall said he arrived outside the precinct around 4:15 a.m. not because of anxiety about wait times, but because he was an insomniac. “Either way, I would have been up,” said Mr. Hall, 70, a custodian. The Fulton County elections director, Richard Barron, said on Monday that turnout on Tuesday could break records for his jurisdiction, with between 140,000 and 170,000 voters expected to cast ballots in person. At the higher turnout, more than 80 percent of the county’s registered voters would have cast a ballot. — Maria Cramer, Kay Nolan, Jon Hurdle, Michael Venutolo-Mantovani, Kathleen Gray and Sean Keenan Abortion. Guns. Police. Schools. Health care. Covid-19. These are just a few of the issues that state legislatures will make laws about next year. Not to mention the once-a-decade event: redrawing state and national electoral maps after the decennial census, an exercise that can give one political party a deep and enduring advantage in lawmaking for years. So, while the campaigns for president and seats in Congress may have absorbed much of the nation’s attention, the elections to determine control of state government — more than 5,000 legislative races farther down the ballot — could also have a major effect on Americans’ lives. About 80 percent of the nation’s 7,383 state legislative seats are up for grabs this year, with elections in 44 states, according to Tim Storey, an expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures, or N.C.S.L. The stakes are high for both parties. Democrats are on offense in state elections this year, trying to pry chambers away from G.O.P. control, but Mr. Storey said it was highly unlikely that the Democrats would make gains anywhere close to those that Republicans scored in the 2010 election cycle, when they gained a whopping 24 chambers, the culmination of a historic realignment of Southern legislatures toward the Republican Party. Demographic change is slow, he said, and movement of a state from one party to the other is usually gradual. A few of the chambers Democrats are aiming to flip, he said, are the Texas House, the North Carolina House and Senate, the Arizona House and Senate, the Minnesota Senate, and the Pennsylvania, Michigan and Iowa Houses. Republicans, for their part, are looking to take New Hampshire’s House and Senate. Republicans have a distinct advantage in statehouses today. Of the 98 partisan legislative chambers in 49 states, about three-fifths — 59 chambers — are controlled by Republicans, and the remaining 39 by Democrats, according to the N.C.S.L. (Nebraska’s Legislature has only one chamber and its elections are officially nonpartisan.) In all but one of the states with two chambers (Minnesota is the exception), the same party controls both chambers. That is an effect of rising polarization and the growing tendency of voters to stick with a single political party up and down the ballot. The 2010 Republican sweep coincided with a census, giving Republicans disproportionate control just when lines were to be redrawn for congressional and state electoral districts across the country. The effects are still being felt today. The redistricting process begins again next year, when the Census Bureau delivers population data to each state. That usually happens by April 1, though the timeline is less certain this year because of delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and by continuing litigation. — Sabrina Tavernise “Keep calm, vote on,” Christopher Krebs, the man responsible for keeping America’s voting infrastructure safe from foreign interference and domestic disaster, told reporters early on Election Day. “And then, after today, keep calm and let them count.” For Mr. Krebs, a former Microsoft executive who has seemed like an apolitical anomaly in President Trump’s highly politicized Department of Homeland Security, it was a telling comment — at a culminating moment. For the past four years, he has charged ahead with an aggressive plan to build resilience into the American voting system, getting states to use more paper backups, running drills for state election officials and creating a “rumor control” website. His admirers, who include a large number of Democrats, often wonder aloud how he has remained employed as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The answer is that he has learned to navigate just under the radar of Mr. Trump, never openly contradicting him — and rarely using his name — while delivering a very different message than the one coming from the president. That is essentially what he did on Tuesday morning: his “keep calm and let them count” comment ran contrary to Mr. Trump’s repeated declarations that results have to be announced Tuesday night, and the battery of lawyers the president has prepared to challenge counts that go later into the week, as mail-in ballots are tabulated. On Tuesday, Mr. Krebs cautioned that things will go wrong in the natural course of an Election Day. But he also touted how American intelligence agencies had quickly determined last month that threatening emails sent to a few hundred voters that appeared to be from the “Proud Boys,” a right-wing extremist group, had actually been sent by Iranians. He also pointed to new efforts by a Russian-based hacking team. None worked, so far. “We are not out of the woods yet,” Mr. Krebs said. “Today in some sense is halftime.” — David E. Sanger With Democrats  seeking to pick up enough seats to take control of the Senate for the first time since 2015, vulnerable Republicans and their Democratic challengers made their closing arguments as Americans cast their votes. In Maine, where the moderate Republican incumbent, Susan Collins, has been trailing her Democratic opponent, Sara Gideon, in the polls, Ms. Collins returned to her hometown, Caribou, on Tuesday, where she greeted supporters ahead of a day packed with visits to small businesses, shops and restaurants. Billing herself as “our senator,” Ms. Collins has sought to highlight her prowess as a local advocate as she tries to overcome the millions of dollars spent against her and simmering outrage over her key votes to approve the 2017 Republican tax plan and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination. Ms. Gideon, the state’s speaker of the House, has capitalized on national anger over the Trump administration and the Republican majority in the Senate, framing her candidacy as part of a broader vision for Democratic voters eager to see their party in power and their priorities addressed, including systemic inequalities and climate change. “Mainers are ready for new leadership,” Ms. Gideon said at her final campaign event Monday night. “Mainers are ready, also, not just to look at what is going wrong or to fight against what we need to do differently, but to have a vision of what we can be instead, and to grow into that.” With Republicans holding the Senate majority by a margin of 53 to 47, a net gain of three seats would put Democrats in control if Joseph R. Biden Jr. wins the presidency; four would be required if President Trump is re-elected. In addition to Ms. Collins’s race, Senate races where Republican incumbents are considered most vulnerable include these: Arizona: Senator Martha McSally, a Trump ally appointed to the late John McCain’s seat, is facing the Democrat Mark Kelly, a former astronaut, in a special election for the rest of Mr. McCain’s term. Colorado: Senator Cory Gardner has trailed his Democratic challenger, former Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, in polls throughout the campaign. Georgia: There are races for both Senate seats this year, and both are close. In one, Senator David Perdue is fending off a stiff challenge from the Democrat Jon Ossoff, a former investigative journalist. The other is a wild multicandidate race for the seat held by the Republican Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed to succeed Senator Johnny Isakson, who retired for health reasons. In a special election for the remainder of his term, Ms. Loeffler faces a Republican challenger, Representative Doug Collins, and a Democratic challenge from the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock of Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church. If no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote, a runoff will be held in January between the top two finishers. Iowa: Joni Ernst, a freshman senator, has been running neck and neck with her Democratic challenger, Theresa Greenfield, a former real estate developer. North Carolina: The incumbent Thom Tillis is trying to hold on against Cal Cunningham, a Democrat, in what is set to be the most expensive Senate contest ever, with well over $200 million expended. In Alabama, the Democrats are bracing to lose a seat, as the Democratic incumbent Doug Jones has been trailing the Republican Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach. — Andy Newman and Emily Cochrane Poll workers are scrubbing down voting machines before and after each ballot. Voters are being asked to bring their own pens. And, in some states, officials are sending polling places hundreds of thousands of gloves, masks and social-distancing markers. Those are among the precautions being taken as voters in the United States fan out to the polls on Tuesday in the midst of a surge of coronavirus infections that has swamped hospitals and set daily records for new cases in some states. The efforts are intended not only to keep voters and poll workers from becoming infected, but also to make it safe for people who are already sick or isolating to vote, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said over the weekend. The agency said that those people have a right to vote, too. It recommended that voters keep at least six feet from others and issued a six-step guide to help people prepare for voting. Among the suggestions: Bring your own supplies, including two masks, tissues, hand sanitizer with 60 percent alcohol, water and a black ink pen. “You should also let poll workers know that you are sick or in quarantine when you arrive at the polling station,” the center said. In sending voters to the polls in the middle of an uncontrolled outbreak, the United States is trying an experiment that few other countries have attempted. More than 60 countries have postponed votes since the outbreak first took hold, the Council on Foreign Relations has said, while those who did hold elections have struggled to make them safe. The C.D.C. guidelines align with measures that many polling stations around the country are taking to keep safe on Tuesday. Paul Pate, the secretary of state for Iowa, said that his office had distributed 145,000 gloves, 200,000 masks and 11,000 social-distancing markers to be used by voters and poll workers. In Virginia, one city official said that plexiglass was being erected and that personal protection equipment would be distributed to anyone entering the polling station. The state of Ohio has also purchased personal protection equipment, including clear shields, to protect voters and poll workers. Voting machines are to be cleaned before and after each vote, according to a Dayton news station. The Illinois Department of Public Health issued its own Election Day guidelines to polling locations. The agency recommended having separate entrances and exits if possible and replacing shared objects like pens with single-use items. — Derrick Bryson Taylor and Benjamin Mueller The National Guard is on notice. Businesses have boarded up storefronts. University students have been told to stockpile food and supplies. Election Day always provokes anxiety, but this one feels especially unnerving as officials and business owners across the United States brace for potential rioting, violence, vandalism or voter intimidation. As millions of voters headed to the polls, many taking precautions to guard themselves against a deadly pandemic, visible reminders of the fear and uncertainty that have loomed over the campaign could be seen across the nation. Retailers and banks from Boston to Philadelphia and beyond have beefed up security. Disney and Saks Fifth Avenue were among the brand-name stories in Manhattan that boarded up their windows. And Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills has been closed for Election Day and the day after. Even the capital was gearing up for unrest: Businesses are boarded up across downtown Washington, and a metal fence was installed Monday night at the entrance to the White House. Students at George Washington University were advised to prepare for Election Day as they would for a “hurricane or snowstorm.” The preparations reflect a nationwide anxiety produced by a bitter contest between President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr., and the widespread fear that things could get ugly no matter who wins — or when the results are finalized. With Mr. Trump warning supporters of a stolen election at a time when the electorate is sharply polarized, states are bracing for violence. Any official response to violence could be complicated, because the president has broad discretion to sidestep legal restrictions by declaring an insurrection, experts say. That would allow him not only to control state National Guard troops, but also to deploy the Army or Marines — moves that Congress or the courts could be powerless to stop. National Guard troops are already on alert in several states. There was also concern that outside hostile powers might use the moment to sow chaos and confusion. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, reminded his Twitter followers on Monday morning that the country was entering an “unusual” period and that its adversaries might take advantage of this. “Our intelligence community has warned that the period immediately before and after Election Day is going to be uniquely volatile,” Mr. Warner wrote. In interviews on Monday, voters said that the sense of anxiety was palpable. Gary Bennett, 67, of Detroit, said that the number of local business owners that were boarding up stores in his city was unnerving — and that he was ready for life to return to normal. “I’ve been around a long time and have never seen anything like that before,” Mr. Bennett said, adding that he planned to vote for Mr. Biden even though he was not a huge fan. Mikayla Simpson, 18, who was standing in line to vote early in Des Moines, Iowa, wearing earbuds and a Trump 2020 baseball cap, said that she planned to go on with life as usual if Mr. Biden prevailed. “I think it’s insanely immature to commit violence if your candidate doesn’t win,” she said. — Mike Ives, Dave Philipps, Kathy Gray, Mike Anderson and Mark Leibovich  More than 8,000 miles from the White House, in a small Indian village ringed by lush green rice paddies, several dozen people flocked into a Hindu temple, carrying roses and strings of sweet-smelling jasmine, uttering prayers for Kamala Harris. This village, Thulasendrapuram, has a special relationship to Ms. Harris. It’s where her maternal grandfather was born more than 100 years ago. On Tuesday, Thulasendrapuram, which is about an eight-hour drive from the southern city of Chennai, pulled together in a special ceremony at the main temple to wish Ms. Harris good luck. Men wearing white dhotis, a sarong-like wrap, and women in bright saris draped Hindu idols with flowers and chanted hymns. As the election began to unfold in the United States, everyone was bubbly with confidence that Joseph R. Biden and Ms. Harris would win. “She is the daughter of the village’s soil,’ said Lalitha, a housewife, who could barely contain her excitement. “The position she has attained is unbelievable.” Although Ms. Harris has been more understated about her Indian heritage than her experience as a Black woman, her path to U.S. vice-presidential pick has also been guided by the values of her Indian-born mother and her wider Indian family. In several big speeches, Ms. Harris has gushed about her Indian grandfather, P.V. Gopalan, who inspired her with his stories about fighting for the rights of Indians to win independence from Britain. Wearing Coke-bottle glasses and often a necktie, Mr. Gopalan was a career civil servant who may have looked like many other upper-crust Indian gentlemen. But he defied the conservative stereotypes of his era, lending unswerving support to the women in his family, especially Ms. Harris’s mother, Shyamala Gopalan. She came to America in the late 1950s young and alone and made a career as a breast cancer researcher before dying of cancer in 2009. As soon as the good luck ceremony ended on Tuesday, villagers laid out a feast of idli and sambar, two South Indian dishes that elders were eager to point out are favorites of Ms. Harris. The village is already planning big things. One villager said the temple was sure to get more donations, should Ms. Harris win. Another hoped the government would build a college. “It’s quite obvious that the village people are hoping that once she wins this election she will do us some favors,” explained R. R. Kalidas Vandayar, an elder. “We are hoping the prayers work.” — Jeffrey Gettleman, Suhasini Raj and Prakash Elumalai Facebook, Twitter and YouTube plan to take a series of steps on Election Day to prevent the spread of misinformation, particularly around the results and the integrity of voting. At Facebook, an operations center staffed by dozens of employees — what the company calls a war room — will work Tuesday to identify efforts to destabilize the election. The team, which will work virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic, has already been in action, Facebook said. In a Twitter post on Monday night, Facebook said that the team was also tracking “potentially dangerous activity we saw with the swarming of Biden campaign buses this weekend,” a reference to the caravan of Trump supporters that surrounded a Biden campaign bus in Texas. “We are monitoring closely and will remove content calling for coordinated harm or interference with anyone’s ability to vote,” it added. Facebook’s app also will look different on Tuesday. To prevent candidates from prematurely and inaccurately declaring victory, the company plans to add a notification at the top of News Feeds letting people know that no winner has been chosen until election results are verified by news outlets like Reuters and The Associated Press. Twitter’s strategy is twofold. One group of employees will work to root out false claims and networks of bots that spread such information by using both algorithms and human analysts, while another team will highlight reliable information in the Explore and Trends sections of its service. Twitter plans to add labels to tweets from candidates who claim victory before the election is called by authoritative sources. At least two news outlets will need to independently project the results before a candidate can use Twitter to celebrate his or her win, the company said. On Monday, Twitter labeled a post by Richard Grenell, President Trump’s former acting director of national intelligence, showing Joseph R. Biden Jr. on a campaign plane without a mask as manipulated media. The photo used by Mr. Grenell, a former U.S. ambassador to Germany, was from 2019 before the pandemic. But social media companies had a haphazard response on Monday to a video of Mr. Biden that was deceptively edited to make it appear as though he were admitting to voter fraud, labeling some versions of the video and not others. The video was viewed more than 17 million times on social media platforms, according to Avaaz, a progressive human-rights nonprofit that studied it. The video was an edited clip from an Oct. 24 appearance by Mr. Biden, on the podcast “Pod Save America,” in which he discussed the Obama administration’s efforts to combat voter fraud and said that he had put together “the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.” YouTube said it would be especially sensitive about videos that attempt to challenge the election’s integrity. YouTube already does not allow videos that mislead voters about how to vote or the eligibility of a candidate, or that incite people to interfere with the voting process. The company said it would take down such videos quickly, even if one of the speakers was a presidential candidate. As the polls close, YouTube will feature a playlist of live election results coverage from what it deems authoritative news sources. — Mike Isaac, Kate Conger, Daisuke Wakabayashi, Neil Vigdor and Sheera Frenkel The results are already in from two New Hampshire towns where voters famously head to the polls just after the stroke of midnight on Election Day. In Dixville Notch, where a handful of masked residents voted shortly after midnight on Tuesday, all five votes for president went to Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee. He is the first presidential candidate to sweep the general election vote in Dixville Notch since the midnight voting tradition began there in 1960, when Richard M. Nixon won all nine votes over John F. Kennedy. The other northern New Hampshire town that voted around the same time on Tuesday, Millsfield, favored President Trump by 16 votes to 5. A third town, Hart’s Location, canceled its traditional midnight voting this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The 48 voters there will have to wait until the morning like everyone else. Antsy journalists and political types often look to these New Hampshire towns for clues as to how the election will unfold across the country, but they have a spotty track record. While Millsfield voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, Dixville Notch went for Hillary Clinton. And in the Democratic primary election — which also kicks off in New Hampshire — Dixville Notch cast three of its five votes this year for Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York. He suspended his campaign less than a month later. — Jennifer Jett  It’s not exactly Eminem’s appeal to voters that they have “one opportunity” to elect the Biden-Harris ticket. But an Iranian band has made a viral rap video hit in Iran with a similar message to Americans: The ballot you cast will have a direct impact on our lives. “Our hands are lifted in prayer, what’s gonna happen in America? What’s gonna happen in America?” the band, Dasandaz, sings in Persian, with English subtitles. انتخابات آمریکا جوری روی زندگیمون تاثیر می‌ذاره که الان نوزادها هم صبر کردن به دنیا نمیان تا ببینن نتیجه انتخابات چی می‌شه :))

Mr. Khamenei, who has the final word on all matters of state in Iran, expounded on that position Tuesday, asserting in a televised speech that the United States is doomed to fail no matter who is elected. “There will definitely be changes with a new person but these changes are irrelevant to us,” Mr. Khamenei said.  “Our policy toward the United States is calculated and clear and it does not change by people coming and going.” “Of course, some of them if they take office will destroy America sooner,” he said, “and some others if elected will cause America to be destroyed a bit later.” But ordinary Iranians, analysts and many politicians disagree. They openly say, on social media, media commentary and interviews, that America’s 2020 presidential election is the most consequential for the Islamic Republic in its 41-year history. The outcome could set the course for whether Iran faces more economic collapse, isolation and potential military conflict with a Trump administration or a return to the nuclear deal that President Trump discarded, which could ease economic sanctions and lead to engagement with a Biden administration. “Iranians deserve at least 1,000 polling stations and 20 electoral votes in the U.S. election because of how directly our lives are impacted by it,” Siamak Ghassemi, an economist, said on Twitter. He hosted a live Instagram session on Monday for his 340,000 followers to help explain how the U.S. elections could affect Iran’s economy. Iranians, like many people around the world, are fixated on the twists and turns of the U.S. election this year. Many stayed up all night to watch the debates and campaign speeches and follow the polls closely. Iranian media have dedicated coverage to the election and often run explanatory articles aimed at educating Iranians on how the electoral votes are tallied. “If you want to eat healthy food, take care of your kid with bare minimum basics, it’s a big struggle in Tehran,” said Nasim Ghazizadeh, a mother and reporter with Shargh newspaper in Tehran. “Our economy can’t take four more years of this.” — Farnaz Fassihi It remains one of the most surprising facts about voting in the United States: While the popular vote elects members of Congress, mayors, governors, state legislators and even more obscure local officials, it does not determine the winner of the presidency, the highest office in the land. That important decision ultimately falls to the Electoral College. When Americans cast their ballots, they are actually voting for a slate of electors appointed by their state’s political parties who are pledged to support that party’s candidate. (They don’t always do so.) This leads to an intense focus on key battleground states, as candidates look to increase their electoral advantage by targeting states that can help them reach the needed 270 votes of the total 538 total up for grabs. The Electoral College also inspires many what-if scenarios, some of them more likely than others. How did this system evolve, and will it ever change? What happens in a tie? And what’s different about Nebraska and Maine? We’ve got answers to all your Electoral College questions. — Allyson Waller Despite fears about the potential for violence at the polls, including that illegal armed paramilitary groups might try to intimidate voters, relatively few incidents were reported during the morning, with early indications suggesting that voting was going relatively peacefully and for the most part smoothly, apart from some isolated incidents. There were scattered complaints about people shouting at voters in line and the like, but nothing out of the ordinary from any election year, said Kristen Clarke, who is heading a team of lawyers running the nationwide Election Protection Hotline. Bob Bauer, a former White House counsel who is helping to lead the Biden campaign’s election protection efforts, said that the campaign was seeing “minimal issues and disruptions” around voting, and that “by and large, voting is proceeding smoothly. But there were some sporadic acts of apparent voter intimidation that were reported on Tuesday. In Chicago, a man told the police that a group had clubbed his car with baseball bats as he drove near a polling site, according to Sally Brown, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Police Department. The staff at a museum in Kansas City, Mo., moved to cover up a spray-painted message reading “Don’t Vote.” The Michigan attorney general, Dana Nessel, said on Twitter that robocalls were directing voters to delay voting until Wednesday — which is, of course, after the election — to avoid long lines. “Obviously this is FALSE and an effort to suppress the vote. No long lines and today is the last day to vote,” Ms. Nessel said. “Don’t believe the lies! Have your voice heard!” After weeks of intelligence warnings of voter intimidation and potential violence at polling sites, there were few reports of disruptions. But law enforcement officials across the nation were still on high alert after a weekend of caravans were captured blocking roadways and an uptick of threats made online. Homeland Security intelligence warned last month that extremists could look to target “physical election infrastructure” like polling sites. Separately,  federal officials and local police were preparing for mass unrest going into election night with the Homeland Security Department deploying tactical agents from Customs and Border Protection and ICE throughout the United States to stand by to protect federal property. A new fence was being erected near Lafayette Square, the scene of clashes between protesters and the police this summer. Retailers and banks from Boston to Philadelphia and beyond have beefed up security. Disney and Saks Fifth Avenue were among the brand-name stories in Manhattan that boarded up their windows. And Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills has been closed for Election Day and the day after. The preparations reflect a nationwide anxiety produced by a bitter contest between President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr., and the widespread fear that things could get ugly no matter who wins — or when the results are finalized. — Zolan Kanno-Youngs, Neil MacFarquhar and Kathleen Gray It’s a thrill to be the first news organization to declare the winner of a presidential race. But no journalist wants to be stuck with the job of reversing a blown call. That’s how it went for NBC’s Tom Brokaw and other news anchors in 2000, after they reported that Al Gore had defeated George W. Bush. “We don’t just have egg on our face,” Mr. Brokaw told viewers. “We have an omelet.” At the end of a 2020 campaign complicated by significant early voting and unfounded claims by President Trump that the election has been “rigged,” journalists have pledged caution going into Tuesday night. They remember all too well how Mr. Trump defied the polls four years ago, and they do not want to be caught off guard off again. With their interactive maps and coifed pundits, the broadcast networks and cable news outlets are set up to deliver some spectacle along with the news — but they have vowed to be prudent. “Frankly, the well-being of the country depends on us being cautious, disciplined and unassailably correct,” Noah Oppenheim, the NBC News president, said in a recent interview. “We are committed to getting this right.” Susan Zirinsky, the president of CBS News, said the team she oversees will try to manage the expectations of impatient viewers. “We’re preparing the audience that this might not be over in one night,” Ms. Zirinsky said. In the United States — which, unlike many other countries, does not have a national electoral commission — the role of calling the winners of presidential elections falls to the news media. Here’s how it will work: Each TV network makes its own state-by-state determinations. ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC, as part of the group of news organizations belonging to the National Election Pool, base their calls on data gathered by Edison Research. The Associated Press, which has assigned 4,000 reporters to collect information from county clerks in 50 states, conducts its own count. Fox News, starting in 2018, has relied on a model that draws from data provided by The A.P. Major news organizations, including NPR, PBS and the newspaper chains Gannett and McClatchy, wait for The A.P. to call races before they report results. Other outlets, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, use data from The A.P. to help them make their own determinations. Reuters will deliver results in collaboration with the National Election Pool. The A.P. has been known for its cautious approach since it started tracking the vote in 1848, when Zachary Taylor won the presidency. In 2000, The A.P. resisted the temptation to declare a winner in the race between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush. “If there’s no way for the trailing candidate to catch up, no legal way, no mathematical way, then the race is decided, essentially,” Sally Buzbee, The A.P.’s executive editor, said. “And if there is any uncertainty, or if there are enough votes out to change the result, then we don’t call the race.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
