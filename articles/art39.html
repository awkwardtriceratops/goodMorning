In Iowa, Biden criticizes Trump’s virus response and trade policies that ‘cost farmers and manufacturing so badly.’ More than 9 million people have voted early in Texas, surpassing the state’s total 2016 turnout. ‘This is no time to let up,’ Kamala Harris tells Texas Democrats. Lil Wayne becomes the latest rapper to align himself with Trump, and to face a backlash. Who will win Florida? What the polls say about an eternal mystery. Trump will finish with a two-day, 10-event dash ending in Grand Rapids, the site of his last 2016 rally. Donald Trump Jr. said virus deaths had fallen to ‘almost nothing’ as over 1,000 died in the U.S. With President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. converging today on Wisconsin — a state the president won in 2016 by roughly 22,000 votes, or less than a percentage point — the key to winning the state could lie in places like the Fox Valley. The valley, a three-county stretch from Green Bay to Oshkosh, is the most politically competitive region in one of America’s most hotly contested states, where Mr. Trump, who is holding a rally in Green Bay this afternoon, has trailed steadily in polls. Democrats tend to focus their Wisconsin efforts on turning out voters in the liberal cities of Milwaukee and Madison — Mr. Biden is speaking at the airport in Milwaukee this evening — while Republicans concentrate on the conservative suburbs ringing Milwaukee. But it is often the Fox Valley where elections are won or lost. And this year, there is a new wild card: the coronavirus is rampaging through the Fox Valley, with new case counts averaging nearly 600 a day. The three counties — Brown, Outagamie and Winnebago — all backed Mr. Obama in 2008, and two of the three narrowly went for Mitt Romney in 2012 before they all backed Mr. Trump four years later. And in 2018, all three counties backed Gov. Scott Walker, a conservative Republican who narrowly lost his bid for a third term as governor, and Senator Tammy Baldwin, a liberal Democrat who coasted to re-election. “It’s a purple region within a purple state, and purple regions swing back and forth depending on the times,” said Senator Ron Johnson, an Oshkosh Republican. The combination of old factory towns and rural voters who have migrated to the Republican Party, college towns and small cities becoming increasingly Democratic, and Catholic voters inclined to back Democrats as long as they aren’t too strident on abortion rights has made the region a real presidential battleground. It is the headquarters of the John Birch Society and the cradle of McCarthyism — Senator Joseph McCarthy was born in Grand Chute — but it reveres the Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, one of the N.F.L.’s most prominent social justice activists. It is also an epicenter of the coronavirus surge battering Wisconsin. All three counties have new virus case counts that exceed the state’s average for the last week. Of the 15 cities with the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the country, eight are in Wisconsin, and five — Appleton, Fond du Lac, Green Bay, Manitowoc and Oshkosh — are in the greater Fox Valley. And that may change the political equation in an area that is not ordinarily driven by national issues. — Reid J. Epstein ON THE TRAIL TRANSCRIPT And I do believe Laura Ingraham is here someplace. Where is Laura? Where is she? Where is Laura? I can’t recognize you. Is that a mask? No way. Are you wearing a mask? I’ve never seen her in a mask. Look at you. She’s being very politically correct. Well I’ve never seen — Laura Ingraham. She’s fantastic. Thank you. Yes, I’ve never seen that before. President Trump mocked the Fox News host Laura Ingraham for wearing a mask as she attended his first campaign rally of the day in Michigan on Friday. Spotting Ms. Ingraham at the Waterford Township event, Mr. Trump said, “I can’t recognize you. Is that a mask? No way, are you wearing a mask? I’ve never seen her in a mask. Look at you. Laura, she’s being very politically correct. Whoa!” Mr. Trump has continued to insist he has no problem with mask-wearing while mocking others for wearing them, and accusing them of making a political statement by doing so. Health experts have said face coverings slow the spread of the coronavirus. Ms. Ingraham attended the White House event last month when Mr. Trump announced the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court — an event where few people wore masks or practiced social distancing and which was later described as a superspreader event after numerous guests became infected with the coronavirus. Earlier, Mr. Trump falsely claimed there would be a vaccine ready in “just a couple of weeks,” and falsely claimed that hospitals are overstating the number of coronavirus deaths in order to get additional federal money. Then he predicted the way the press would cover him: “They’ll say, ‘Oh, it’s terrible what he said.’ ” — Maggie Haberman ON THE TRAIL Joseph R. Biden Jr. hurled a barrage of attacks at President Trump during a drive-in rally in Iowa on Friday, slamming him on his mismanagement of the coronavirus response and denouncing his trade policies that have “cost farmers and manufacturing so badly,” in a sign of how competitive the state has become with just four days left in the campaign. Speaking at the state fairgrounds in Des Moines, Mr. Biden made a series of direct appeals to Iowans, noting the surge of coronavirus cases in the state and speaking more than usual about trade policies in terms of how they have affected farmers, who make up a considerable part of the state’s economy. And in an especially blunt entreaty, he reminded voters that they had helped elect him and former President Obama, who won the state twice. “In 2008 and 2012, you placed your trust in Barack Obama and me, and we worked for you, for the entire country,” he said. “I’ll do it again in 2020.” Mr. Biden also praised the Democratic candidate for United States Senate, Theresa Greenfield, who is in a very tight race against her Republican opponent, Senator Joni Ernst. In a particularly biting barb in a state blanketed with farms, he knocked Ms. Ernst for not knowing the correct break-even price of soybeans, a key crop in Iowa, at a recent Senate debate. “You’d think that’d be fairly basic,” he said. “That’s like my not knowing where the Delaware River was back home.” While Iowa could be crucial to a Biden victory this year, the state was not kind to him during the first-in-the-nation caucuses nine months ago, when he came in fourth. But Mr. Biden now finds himself in a much stronger position, in part because of the bungled coronavirus response by Mr. Trump and Iowa’s mask-resistant Republican governor, Kim Reynolds. The state is seeing a sharp increase in coronavirus rates, with outbreaks racing through several meatpacking plants. The virus has killed more than 1,700 people there. Iowa Democrats think Mr. Biden has a decent chance to win back a state where Barack Obama won by nearly 6 percentage points in 2012 but Mr. Trump won by more than nine points in 2016. “People here are cautiously optimistic and see this as a real shot to win,” said Zach Wahls, a prominent state senator in eastern Iowa who supported Ms. Warren in the caucuses. “On caucus night, I don’t think I would have ever said that I’d be excited to vote for Joe Biden,” he said. “And I was thrilled to vote for Joe Biden.” Complicating matters, however, may be the coronavirus, which continues to rampage across the state. On Thursday, NPR reported that voters would not be able to cast their ballots at polling places in cities including Waterloo, Fort Dodge and Council Bluffs because of closures resulting from the virus. Mr. Biden is set to hold two more rallies on Friday, in Minnesota and Wisconsin. — Sydney Ember Texas, a 2020 jump-ball state once considered a layup for Republicans, is shattering turnout records, with the number of early in-person and mail- ballots now exceeding the total number of votes cast statewide in the 2016 election. Early-voting turnout has been enormous across the country, spurred by the coronavirus pandemic and one of the most bitterly contested presidential races in history, accelerating a years-in-the-making shift away from Election Day-only voting. As of Friday morning, more than 83 million votes had been cast, representing more than 60 percent of the total ballots cast four years ago, according to the nonpartisan U.S. Elections Project. In 11 states, voters have already submitted 80 percent of the ballots cast in those states in 2016, and five of them — Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada, along with Texas — are battlegrounds. Texas, the nation’s second most-populous state, was the second to pass its 2016 threshold. (The first was Hawaii.) The Texas secretary of state’s office reported Friday morning — the last day for early voting in the state — that 9,009,850 people had already voted by mail, dropped ballots in boxes or showed up at polling sites. Four years ago, a record-breaking 8,969,226 Texans voted in the election. The Texas increase has been fueled by huge turnout in urban, Democratic areas, like Harris County, home to Houston, but rural counties that have traditionally voted Republican have also seen significant jumps in voting. Polls show a near dead-heat in the state, with a slight edge for President Trump. Though Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, is making a late swing through the state today, with visits to Houston, McAllen and Fort Worth, the Biden campaign has not put significant time or money into the state, arguing that it is a bad investment: Texas has multiple expensive media markets and is not an essential stop on Mr. Biden’s path to 270 electoral votes. Early-voting patterns, especially in big cities like San Antonio and Austin, suggest that the underlying dynamics of the race are less like 2016, when Mr. Trump won by 9 percentage points, than the 2018 midterms, when Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, narrowly beat Representative Beto O’Rourke, a Democrat. “There’s no doubt that it’s a real race,” Mr. Cruz said recently. The surge in turnout comes despite the fact that Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, a Trump ally, has limited the number of drop boxes to one per county, an order that greatly advantages low-population counties where Republicans predominate. The drop-box limit has been offset by big new investments in election infrastructure in Harris County and elsewhere. Harris County officials opened 10 drive-through voting sites across the county, fighting off an effort by the state Republican Party to shut them down. A separate action by the governor, extending the statewide early voting period by six days, has also contributed to the increases. — Glenn Thrush ON THE TRAIL FORT WORTH — Senator Kamala Harris urged Texas Democrats on Friday to keep fighting hard, as early voting numbers shattered records in this traditionally ruby red state. More than 9 million people have already voted in Texas, more than cast ballots in the state in the entire 2016 election. About a quarter of those voters did not cast ballots in 2016, according to TargetSmart, a Democratic data firm, “You all have been doing your thing,” Ms. Harris, told a socially distanced audience gathered on a sunny afternoon in Fort Worth. “Now, we know this is no time to let up on the pedal, though.” That Ms. Harris plans to spend much of the day in Texas, with stops in McAllen and Houston tonight, underscores the political changes sweeping this fast-growing state. Polling shows a near dead heat, giving only a slight edge to President Trump. Much of the increased Democratic support in Texas has come from demographic changes in the suburbs of Dallas and Houston, where voters have been turned off by the president’s divisive rhetoric and disapprove of how he’s handled the coronavirus pandemic. The Biden campaign has not put significant time or money into Texas, despite the pleas of local Democrats. Strategists in the state see a path to winning that largely mirrors Ms. Harris’s itinerary: Record turnout in urban areas, capturing suburban swing voters and boosting numbers in traditionally lower turnout border areas. Ms. Harris warned of Republican efforts to suppress voting rights, pointing to lawsuits and complicated rules for mail voting. In Texas, a state that does not permit no-excuse absentee voting, Gov. Greg Abbott extended early voting by an additional six days over the objections of his fellow Republicans. But he’s also aggressively sought to limit the drop-off locations for absentee ballots. “They know our power,” she told the largely Black audience. “They know that when we vote, we win.” — Lisa Lerer President Trump’s photo op on Thursday night with Lil Wayne, the multiplatinum rapper, immediately went viral on social media. The backlash came swiftly too, making Lil Wayne the latest in a line of rappers to align themselves, however briefly, with the president’s re-election campaign, only to face criticism from fans and fellow artists. “Just had a great meeting with @realdonaldtrump,” Lil Wayne posted to his nearly 35 million followers on Twitter after the two posed together in Florida, earning a retweet from the president. “He listened to what we had to say today and assured he will and can get it done.” Just had a great meeting with @realdonaldtrump @potus besides what he’s done so far with criminal reform, the platinum plan is going to give the community real ownership. He listened to what we had to say today and assured he will and can get it done. 🤙🏾 pic.twitter.com/Q9c5k1yMWf Lil Wayne, like Ice Cube before him, had cited the president’s Platinum Plan, a vague two-page document rolled out in September that promised to “increase access to capital in Black communities by almost $500 billion” over the next four years. The radio host Charlamagne tha God, a host of The Breakfast Club on Power 105.1 FM in New York, responded in a segment on Friday morning, calling Lil Wayne’s apparent endorsement a distraction. While he noted that Black voters are not monolithic, Charlamagne added, “Trust me when I tell you, Black people are not on the Trump administration’s agenda, nor will we ever be. All of our civil liberties are at risk.” Earlier this month, the New York rapper 50 Cent also seemed to endorse President Trump in a post on Instagram, claiming Joseph R. Biden Jr. would raise taxes. “I don’t care Trump doesn’t like black people,” 50 Cent wrote. “62% are you out of ya [expletive] mind.” (Instagram marked the post as “missing context” and in need of a fact-check.) But the rapper soon walked back his support for Mr. Trump, and on Thursday, he reacted negatively to Lil Wayne’s political post. “oh no,” 50 Cent wrote on Thursday evening. “I WOULD HAVE NEVER TOOK THIS PICTURE.” Ice Cube, a founding member of N.W.A., who released a song called “Arrest the President” as recently as 2018, faced similar scrutiny after it was announced this month that he had consulted with the Trump administration on the Platinum Plan. He said later that he hoped to work with both sides, and was not endorsing Mr. Trump, adding, “I don’t trust none of them.” Throughout the campaign, Mr. Trump has called himself the best president for Black Americans since Abraham Lincoln, despite having stoked racial divisions before and since being elected president and repeatedly refusing to denounce white supremacists. His campaign has said that it hoped to slightly improve on its performance with Black voters in 2016, when he earned the support of about 8 percent of Black voters. While rappers like Cardi B, Offset and Snoop Dogg have expressed support for Mr. Biden, others like Waka Flocka Flame and Lil Pump, who is of Mexican and Cuban descent, have signaled an openness to supporting the president. — Joe Coscarelli  This year’s presidential race in Florida looks similar to 2016 in at least one regard: It will probably be very close. But who’s voting for whom will be quite different. President Trump can count on the continued support of rural voters and white men, while Joseph R. Biden Jr. is almost guaranteed to carry strong support from women and Black voters across the state. But Mr. Biden is unlikely to repeat Hillary Clinton’s strong showing with Latino voters; he’s looking to make up for it among some of the white voting blocs that Mr. Trump relied on in 2016, particularly suburbanites and older voters. A batch of high-quality Florida polls arrived this final week before Election Day, and all showed Mr. Biden leading by 3 to 6 percentage points among likely voters. The surveys from Monmouth University, Quinnipiac University and NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College put Mr. Biden in a strong position to pull together a winning coalition in Florida, which has voted for the victor in the past six presidential elections. In each poll, the difference was within the margin of error, and the polling miss of 2016, when Florida surveys overestimated Mrs. Clinton’s support by a couple of points, should give us pause. But Mr. Trump’s 2016 Florida victory relied heavily on late-deciding voters, and in both the Monmouth and Marist polls, no more than 2 percent of voters said they still didn’t know how they would vote. In Florida, not only have most voters long made up their minds, they have already voted: Nearly eight million people have cast early ballots in Florida as of Friday morning, more than 80 percent of the state’s total 2016 turnout. In both the Monmouth and Quinnipiac polls, just 17 percent of likely voters said they would vote on Election Day. Higher turnout leaves less room for certain groups to under-participate, as Democratic voters did in 2016, which further threw off polls. Slightly more Democrats have turned out than Republicans so far, though only by 200,000 votes. That advantage is padded by Mr. Biden’s polling lead among independents, who have cast about one in five ballots so far. Republicans can count on a last-minute voting surge come Election Day, when they are almost certain to outnumber Democrats going to the polls. But given how many votes will have been cast by then, and since less than one in five voters are telling pollsters they plan to vote that day, it may be a steep uphill climb. — Giovanni Russonello President Trump will cap off the 2020 presidential campaign with a two-day, seven-state, 10-rally mad dash that embodies his total saturation approach to politics and his faith in overcoming obstacles through perpetual motion, force of will and a torrent of talk. As a warm-up, Mr. Trump, who was briefly hospitalized with the coronavirus just a few weeks ago, will make a three-rally trip to the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday, with stops in Reading, Butler and Montoursville, where he is expected to appear with other Republican candidates. The real frequent flying happens Sunday and Monday, a pair of five-rally days intended to emulate the breakneck pace of his 2016 homestretch, a golden and nostalgic period for Mr. Trump, who believes he outworked Hillary Clinton to win the presidency. Mr. Trump’s Sunday starts in Macomb County, Mich., outside Detroit, long viewed as a national bellwether, with a morning rally at the Total Sports Park Complex. From there he flies to Dubuque, Iowa, for an afternoon event, then east to Hickory, N.C., for an evening rally. The day concludes with stops in Rome, Ga., where he is expected to campaign with the embattled Republican Senator David Perdue, and an 11:30 p.m. rally in Opa-locka, Fla., near Miami, an hour’s drive south of his residence at the Mar-a-Lago Club. On Monday, Mr. Trump works his way back north, flying to Fayetteville, N.C., for a morning speech (a makeup of a rally he canceled on Thursday), then on to Scranton, Pa., Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s hometown, in the afternoon, and on to Traverse City, Mich., for a 5 p.m. “Make America Great” event. His last day on the trail concludes with a nighttime rally in Kenosha, Wis., and another in Grand Rapids, Mich. — his third trip to the state in two days, and the site of his 2016 campaign finale. Still, there is one notable difference from his final appearance four years ago. In 2016, Mr. Trump spoke at the DeVos Place, a convention center named for the father-in-law of his eventual education secretary, Betsy DeVos. This year, he will address supporters at the Gerald R. Ford International Airport, which was named after a one-term Republican president. — Glenn Thrush There are four days until Election Day. Here are the schedules of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates for Friday, Oct. 30. All times are Eastern time. President Trump 1 p.m.: Holds a rally in Waterford Township, Mich. 4 p.m.: Holds a rally in Green Bay, Wis. 6:45 p.m.: Holds a rally in Rochester, Minn. Former Vice President Joseph R.

Afternoon: Speaks at an event with former Representative Beto O’Rourke and the former  federal housing secretary Julián Castro in McAllen, Texas. Evening: Speaks at a rally in Houston. — Glenn Thrush Fluffy, granular snow blanketed New England on Friday morning, accumulating up to four inches in some places and leaving roads slick and slushy, five days ahead of an election whose outcome could hinge on voter turnout. Early voting and campaigning have already been disrupted this week by the extremities of the weather: Powerful Santa Ana winds fueled wildfires in Southern California, and Hurricane Zeta knocked out electricity at some polling stations as it carved a path through the South. But New England and much of the country can expect clear skies on Election Day, with seasonably cool conditions in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, mild weather stretching through the South and over the Rockies and warm weather in store for Southern California. The Pacific Northwest, however, may be in for showers. “Republicans should pray for rain” is an adage in American politics, suggesting that marginalized voters who tend to support Democrats are the most likely to be deterred by weather, and a 2007 analysis of 14 presidential elections published in the Journal of Politics seemed to bear it out. Historically, every inch of rain reduced the turnout by around 1 percent and every inch of snow reduced it by 0.5 percent, the authors found. In both cases, Republicans benefited. More recent analysis, however, suggest that the effect of weather is decreasing, perhaps because more voters are casting their ballots before Election Day. “It could also be that, over time, people just got better at dealing with rain,” said Thomas Fujiwara, an associate professor of economics at Princeton University. “Maybe weather forecasting got a little better. In the 1950s, you could be surprised when it snowed.” — Ellen Barry Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former President Barack Obama will make their first public joint appearances of 2020 at rallies in Detroit and Flint, Mich., as the Biden campaign makes a final push for a Blue Wall state that crumbled on Democrats four years ago. Mr. Biden’s campaign announced on Friday that the two men — whose chilly early alliance blossomed into a genuine friendship over eight years in the White House — “will travel to Michigan to discuss bringing Americans together to address the crises facing the country and winning the battle for the soul of the nation.” The campaign, in keeping with its tight-lipped approach to major events, did not release specific times or locations for the appearances. Both will be “drive-in” rallies in which supporters gather in parking lots at pandemic-appropriate social distances, with an afternoon rally in Flint followed by an evening event in Detroit. Their objective in a state President Trump carried by just 10,704 votes in 2016 was far less of a mystery: Hillary Clinton’s loss was the result, in part, of lackluster turnout among Black voters in Detroit and Flint. Mr. Trump has also spent much of his recent time in the state. He is scheduled to hold a rally this afternoon in Oakland County, a moderate suburban bellwether that has been slipping away from Republicans. Mr. Biden has held a steady lead in the state for months, but his campaign has warned against the kind of overconfidence that prompted Mrs. Clinton to scale back campaigning in the Upper Midwest four years ago. — Glenn Thrush A federal appeals court ruled on Thursday that Minnesota election officials must set aside any ballots that arrive after 8 p.m. on election night, throwing into uncertainty the seven-day grace period that had been in place for ballots postmarked by Election Day. The fate of the segregated ballots remains up in the air. Another court ruling could come down instructing officials whether or not to accept them. The divided state legislature, where Republicans control the Senate and Democrats control the House, could rush through a law regarding the ballots, though that is unlikely. The ruling, issued just five days before the election, comes as an estimated 578,000 absentee ballots that had been requested in the state have not been returned,  according to the U.S. Elections Project. Many of those ballots could already be in the mail, or voters can still return ballots in person. Citing the ruling, several officials urged voters to return their ballots in person. “DO NOT put your ballots in the mail,” Representative Ilhan Omar wrote on Twitter. 🗣 Because of this ruling, 500,000 Minnesotans could be disenfranchised.

Hillary Clinton won our state by just 45,000 votes.

DO NOT put your ballots in the mail.

Vote in-person or drop off your mail-in ballot. Find the nearest drop-off location here: https://t.co/JW3ipWv5yu https://t.co/UtYaQaY975 It also comes as President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. plan to hold rallies in the state today. Mr. Biden has held a steady polling lead in Minnesota for most of the campaign. In its 2-to-1 ruling, the court said that the Minnesota secretary of state had “extended the deadline for receipt of ballots without legislative authorization.” “The consequences of this order are not lost on us,” the court majority wrote. “We acknowledge and understand the concerns over voter confusion, election administration issues, and public confidence in the election.” But, the court said, “we conclude the challenges that will stem from this ruling are preferable to a postelection scenario where mail-in votes, received after the statutory deadline, are either intermingled with ballots received on time or invalidated without prior warning. Better to put those voters on notice now while they still have at least some time to adjust their plans and cast their votes in an unquestionably lawful way.” Judge Jane L. Kelly, in a dissenting opinion, said that the decision “will cause voter confusion and undermine Minnesotans’ confidence in the election process.” She said it also risked disenfranchising voters in Minnesota. Elections officials in the state have been instructing voters who had not mailed their ballots by Tuesday to return them by drop box or to vote in person. But the decision still puts the fate of an unknown number of ballots at risk. The court instructed elections officials to segregate and maintain all ballots that arrive after the 8 p.m. deadline. Democrats in Minnesota denounced the decision. “In the middle of a pandemic, the Republican Party is doing everything to make it hard for you to vote,” Senator Amy Klobuchar, the senior senator from Minnesota and a Democrat, said on Twitter. “Stand up for YOUR rights: Vote in-person or take mail-in ballot directly to ballot box.” About 50 million Americans have already voted by mail. Here’s what processing those ballots looks like in a crucial swing state. — Nick Corasaniti Donald Trump Jr., echoing his father’s inaccurate claim that the country is turning the corner in fighting the pandemic, said on Thursday night that deaths had dropped to “almost nothing,” as the nation reported 1,004 deaths from the coronavirus in one day during a record-breaking surge in cases. “I went through the C.D.C. data, because I kept hearing about new infections, but I was like, ‘Well, why aren’t they talking about this?’ ” Mr. Trump said in an interview with the Fox News host Laura Ingraham, a longtime Trump ally. “Oh, because the number is almost nothing. Because we’ve gotten control of this thing, we understand how it works. They have the therapeutics to be able to deal with this.” As Ms. Ingraham shook her head in agreement, he repeated: “It’s gone to almost nothing.” While some treatments, including the kinds of therapeutics and steroids used on his father, have improved the likelihood of survival for those who are able to obtain them, Mr. Trump’s claims were deeply misleading and perpetuate a dismissive view of the virus widely condemned in the public health community. Mr. Trump called critics of his father’s coronavirus response “truly morons.” The elder Trump echoed his son on Twitter Friday morning, writing that deaths from the virus are “WAY DOWN.” They aren’t. Over the past two weeks, daily fatalities have increased 16 percent nationwide. They just broke 1,000 two days in a row, for the first time in nearly two months. Deaths reached their peak in early April, when more than 2,000 people in the United States were dying of the virus each day, but after falling to about 500 per day in July, deaths climbed back up as states lifted restrictions. In the past two weeks, more than 12,000 people have died of the virus in the United States, sending the official death count, which many health experts say is well below the true toll, past 228,000. At a rally in Tampa, Fla., President Trump said once again that the country was “turning the corner” on the virus and repeated his misleading claim that a vaccine would be widely distributed in a matter of weeks. In fact, nine states set new one-day case records on Thursday, as did the nation, recording more than 90,000 cases for the first time.   — Glenn Thrush When President Trump called the pro-Brexit politician Nigel Farage to the stage during his rally in Goodyear, Ariz., on Wednesday, it was a reminder that Britain’s bombshell vote to leave the European Union in June 2016 was seen as a harbinger of Mr. Trump’s victory in the United States that fall. And yet, four years later, Britain has moved on from Brexit, and Mr. Farage is widely viewed there as yesterday’s man, forced to travel abroad to seek a spotlight that has swung away from him at home. Despite Mr. Trump’s staunch support of Brexit and his effusive displays of affection for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Britain seems equally ready to turn the page on the president. “There are millions and millions of Brits who voted for Brexit and think Donald Trump is ghastly and something quite different,” said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European studies at Oxford University. Inside Mr. Johnson’s government, where the prospect of a Trump defeat has been a source of anxiety for months, officials now talk about how they could adjust to a President Joe Biden. In foreign policy, diplomats spin visions of Britain standing alongside the United States in a coalition of democracies against the commercial and geopolitical pressure of autocrats in China and Russia. That is a role Mr. Johnson could never comfortably play with a president who relishes the company of strongmen. And on one of Mr. Johnson’s top priorities, an Anglo-American trade deal, officials say they could “Bidenize” whatever they have negotiated with Mr. Trump to make it palatable to a Democratic administration, though American analysts are skeptical. “It’s a little tone-deaf to say, ‘We have this deal with Trump. What icing do you want on the cake to make it a Biden deal?’” said Thomas Wright, the director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution in Washington. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
