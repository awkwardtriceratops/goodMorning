Live Updates: Democrats Present a Familiar, and Moderate, Face at Their Convention<br></h1><p id="artcont">Trump urges Goodyear boycott after report that his campaign gear was banned at a plant. The Affordable Care Act, and Trump’s push to repeal it, become a focus at the Democratic convention. Night 3 of the convention features high-stakes speeches. Here’s how to watch. Elizabeth Warren, who speaks tonight, has challenged Wall Street. What will that mean for her future? As Harris prepares to give her speech, some women of color cheer her rise. Hillary Clinton’s return to a Democratic convention will be bittersweet. Biden’s ‘most cops are good’ comment rankles some progressives. Democrats want to know how a Trump megadonor became postmaster general. TRANSCRIPT “Welcome.” “Welcome.” “Welcome —” “— to the second night —” “— of the Democratic National Convention.” “This is a different kind of convention.” “This year —” “— all of us are on the stage.” “And we’ve got a lot to say.” “The presidential election is the world’s most important job interview. At the end, we hire a leader to help us solve problems, create opportunities and give our kids better tomorrows. That’s a tall order this year, with the Covid-19 outbreak on a path to killing 200,000 people and destroying millions of jobs and small businesses. How did Donald Trump respond? Only when Covid exploded in even more states did he encourage people to wear masks. By then, many more were dying. When asked about the surge in deaths, he shrugged and said, ‘It is what it is.’ At a time like this. the Oval Office should be a command center. Instead, it’s a storm center. There’s only chaos. Just one thing never changes: his determination to deny responsibility and shift the blame. The buck never stops there.” “Under our procedural rules, two Democratic candidates submitted nominating documents to our convention secretary for the office of president of the United States: Senator Bernie Sanders and Vice President Joe Biden.” “In a time when millions of people in the United States are looking for deep systemic solutions to our crises of mass evictions, unemployment and lack of health care, en el espíritu del pueblo, and out of a love for all people, I hereby second the nomination of Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont for president of the United States of America.” “I take powerful people up on my elevator all the time. When they get off, they go to their important meetings. Me, I just head back to the lobby. But in the short time I spent with Joe Biden, I could tell he really saw me, that he actually cared. That’s why I nominate my friend Joe Biden as the next president of the United States.” “We’ll now proceed to a roll call by states.” “As an Arizona Latina, I proudly cast our votes: 29 for Bernie Sanders and 51 for our next president, Joe Biden.” “The calamari comeback state of Rhode Island casts one vote for Bernie Sanders and 34 votes for the next president, Joe Biden.” “Delaware is proud to cast its 32 votes for our favorite son and our next president —” “— our friend, Delaware’s Joe Biden.” [music, “Celebration” by Kool and the Gang] [cheering] “I’m pleased to announce that Vice President Joe Biden has officially been nominated by the Democratic Party as our candidate for president of the United States.” “Thank you very, very much from the bottom of my heart. Thank you all. It means the world to me and my family.” “Before Donald Trump, we used to talk about American exceptionalism. The only thing exceptional about the incoherent Trump foreign policy is that it has made our nation more isolated than ever before.” “Our country needs a commander in chief who takes care of our troops in the same way he would his own family. For Joe Biden, that doesn’t need teaching. It comes from the experience he shares with millions of military families: sending his beloved son off to war and praying to God he would come home safe.” “You know, motherhood came to me in a way I never expected. I fell in love with a man and two little boys standing in the wreckage of unthinkable loss, mourning a wife and mother, a daughter and sister. How do you make a broken family whole? The same way you make a nation whole: with love and understanding, and with small acts of kindness, with bravery, with unwavering faith. The burdens we carry are heavy, and we need someone with strong shoulders. I know that if we entrust this nation to Joe, he will do for your family what he did for ours: bring us together and make us whole, carry us forward in our time of need, keep the promise of America for all of us.” “Great job. God love you, I don’t know how you ...” For all of the speakers and images showcasing diversity, and the remarks emphasizing progressive goals, another reality is clear at this midway point in the four-day Democratic convention: This is a party dominated by a 77-year-old white male and leaders from the past with whom he is comfortable, holding to a platform and a campaign that is more centrist and establishment-heavy than left-wing. Of the eight political figures who got the most speaking time Tuesday, only Sally Q. Yates, the 59-year-old former acting attorney general, is younger than 69 years old. Only Colin Powell, 83, isn’t white, and Ms. Yates was the only woman who didn’t appear in a capacity as a political spouse. That will shift somewhat tonight, when Senator Elizabeth Warren and Speaker Nancy Pelosi speak, and major roles go to Kamala Harris, the vice-presidential nominee, and former President Barack Obama. But it won’t feel like the future-oriented convention of 2008, when a 47-year-old Mr. Obama minted a new image and new coalition for the Democratic Party. On the first two nights of the convention, the energy embodied by party’s progressive movement was shoehorned into two speakers: Senator Bernie Sanders, who on Monday urged his followers to swallow their disappointment and back Joseph R. Biden Jr., and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who in her 90-second Tuesday slot made a pitch for “a movement striving to recognize and repair the wounds of racial injustice, colonization, misogyny and homophobia.” By keeping Ms. Ocasio-Cortez from a prime speaking slot — and dividing the keynote address between 17 young-but-moderate officials — the Biden campaign focused its convention on the political middle, avoiding obvious land mines for the Trump campaign to exploit. Even Mr. Biden’s selection of Ms. Harris as his running mate was an exercise in tapping a successor who can shepherd the party’s next generation without moving it too far left. Ms. Harris, though she briefly endorsed Mr. Sanders’s single-payer health care plans, has a long history as a pragmatist. Democrats certainly hope the combination of Ms. Harris on the ticket and the prime speaking slots given to Barack and Michelle Obama — beloved figures, but also leaders from the past — spurs Black turnout that sagged in battleground states in 2016. But the key to victory may be holding onto gains in the suburbs, where many women and longtime Republican voters are watching the Democratic Party’s older, moderate leaders and envisioning a return to a less chaotic time. — Reid J. Epstein TRANSCRIPT Hello, America. My name is Ady Barkan, and I am speaking to you through this computer voice because I have been paralyzed by a mysterious illness called A.L.S. Like so many of you, I have experienced the ways our health care system is fundamentally broken: enormous costs, denied claims, dehumanizing treatment when we are most in need. Since my shocking diagnosis, I have traveled the country meeting countless patients like me, demanding more of our representatives in our democracy. Today we are witnessing the tragic consequences of our failing health care system. In the midst of a pandemic, nearly 100 million Americans do not have sufficient health insurance, and even good insurance does not cover essential needs like long term care. Our loved ones are dying in unsafe nursing homes, our nurses are overwhelmed and unprotected, and our essential workers are treated as dispensable. We live in the richest country in history, and yet we do not guarantee this most basic human right. Everyone living in America should get the health care they need, regardless of their employment status or ability to pay. Even during this terrible crisis, Donald Trump and Republican politicians are trying to take away millions of people’s health insurance. With the existential threat of another four years of this president, we all have a profound obligation to act — not only to vote, but to make sure that our friends, family and neighbors vote as well. We must elect Joe Biden. Each of us must be a hero for our communities, for our country. And then, with a compassionate and intelligent president, we must act together and put on his desk a bill that guarantees us all the health care we deserve. Amid a pandemic that has highlighted the importance of medical care even as millions of Americans who lost their jobs also lost their insurance, some of the most emotionally resonant moments of the second night of the Democratic convention came in discussions of health care. It is an issue that Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sought to lay claim to, by invoking both his fight alongside President Barack Obama to pass the Affordable Care Act and his own history dealing with suffering and loss. One segment showed the candidate listening as supporters described their ordeals in the health care system. The father of a 4-year-old boy in Arizona talked about how his son’s heart transplant was covered by the Affordable Care Act. A former longtime Republican voter, Jeff Jeans, described putting off seeing a doctor for his laryngitis because he was uninsured, only to find out that he had cancer. He said that he signed up for coverage under the act and “that same day, they started my chemo and radiation, and it saved my life.” A video reminded viewers that Mr. Biden “was sworn into the Senate next to a hospital bed” after his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash and his two sons were injured, and that in 2015 he lost his older son Beau to brain cancer. “I remember thinking as Beau lay dying in bed, ” Mr. Biden said in a video, “and thinking to myself, ‘What in God’s name would I do if the doctor said I’m sorry, you’ve outrun your insurance, you’ve reached your cap, suffer the last few months of your life on your own.’” Another clip spotlighted Ady Barkan, the well-known progressive activist who suffers from A.L.S. and is a supporter of “Medicare for all,” which Mr. Biden does not support. Mr. Barkan, whose disease now requires him to speak through a computerized voice, played up some of the common ground he has with Mr. Biden: their opposition to President Trump’s efforts to dismantle the A.C.A. “Even during this terrible crisis, Donald Trump and Republican politicians are trying to take away millions of people’s health insurance,” Mr. Barkan said. — Andy Newman The Supreme Court announced Wednesday that it would hear arguments in the latest case seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act — one backed by President Trump — on Nov. 10, a week after the presidential election. Democrats have seized on Mr. Trump’s support of the case, brought in 2018 by Republican state officials, as an election issue and have repeatedly mentioned it at their convention this week. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee and former vice president under Barack Obama, has campaigned on protecting and improving the Affordable Care Act. The law was the signature domestic achievement of the Obama presidency and has led to millions more Americans having health coverage even as the cost remains out of reach for others. The suit awaiting the Supreme Court argues that when Congress in 2017 zeroed out the law’s penalty for failing to obtain health insurance, it rendered the entire law unconstitutional. The Trump administration sided with the state officials, arguing that the rest of the 2010 law could not survive without the penalty, also called the individual mandate. A federal judge in Texas agreed late in 2018 but postponed the effects of his ruling pending an appeal. An appeals court late last year agreed that the mandate had become unconstitutional but declined to rule on the rest of the health law, asking the lower court to reconsider the question in more detail. That led the defendants — Democratic states and the House of Representatives, which intervened in the case — to ask the Supreme Court to hear the appeal. — Abby Goodnough Joseph R. Biden Jr. is the “presumptive” presidential nominee, no more, after a pretaped rendition of the traditional delegate roll call Tuesday night put him over the 1,991-vote threshold for official nomination. Now the convention moves on to the big-name moments that will probably define it. Wednesday’s prime-time lineup is the closest this variety Zoom-call version of a national political conclave has come to being must-see TV. The night kicks off with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Then Hillary Clinton makes a much-anticipated return to the party’s center stage. The final hour begins with the vice-presidential acceptance speech by Senator Kamala Harris and concludes with former President Barack Obama. The convention will air tonight from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern time. Kerry Washington is the M.C. There are several ways to watch: The Times will stream the full convention, with live analysis from our reporters and real-time highlights from the speeches.

You can watch on a PlayStation 4 or PSVR through the Littlstar app. If you have an Alexa device, you can say “Alexa, play the Democratic National Convention.” Others speaking tonight: Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, the nominal home of the convention. Former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico. — Glenn Thrush and Maggie Astor Elizabeth Warren’s appearance tonight comes a week after Wall Street sighed in relief when Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his vice-presidential running mate instead of the longtime critic of the financial industry. But there’s a catch, according to today’s DealBook newsletter. Ms. Warren’s ability to influence a Biden administration may be stronger now than if she were to become vice president, where she would be more directly limited by the wants of her boss. And while progressive Democrats have rallied behind Ms. Harris, they’ll likely expect something in return. That may mean giving Ms. Warren a spot in the administration, making her speech tonight a showcase — or a tryout, of sorts — of the ideas and approach that she would promote during a Biden presidency. An appointment to Treasury secretary would be a natural fit for the senator, who has made financial regulation a priority (although she is seen as a long shot). If named to the role, Ms. Warren would emphasize Main Street over Wall Street, push for higher taxes on the wealthy and promote spending over fiscal restraint, experts say. Even if she isn’t nominated for the role, Mr. Biden would probably turn to her for advice, especially on priorities for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency she helped create. “She understands financial regulation as a tool to bring about better outcomes,” said Sarah Bloom Raskin, a law professor at Duke and a former deputy secretary at the Treasury Department. There are other jobs a Biden administration could offer her, like attorney general, where she would oversee investigations into the market power of big technology companies, or a bespoke position like a regulatory czar. But some would prefer not to give up Ms. Warren’s seat in the Senate, depending on the balance of power in the chamber. But before any of these decisions can be made, of course, there’s the small matter of whether Mr. Biden can win the election in November. — Lauren Hirsch To Krystina François, a Haitian-American executive director of a Miami nonprofit organization, Kamala Harris is a lot like her, a first-generation daughter of immigrants pursuing the American dream. To Nicole Sanchez, a Chicana consultant in Berkeley, Calif., Ms. Harris is an ambitious woman who listened to the same 1990s hip-hop that she did growing up. And to Carol Kim, an Asian-American union organizer in San Diego, Ms. Harris is the first woman on a national stage whom she can point to and say to her daughter, “She is one of us.” In Ms. Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate and California senator, each of the women said they saw someone familiar. And as Ms. Harris, whose parents immigrated from Jamaica and India, reaches the highest echelons of American politics, dozens of women of color said they also view her success as their own. “How could you not see this as a victory?” Afrah Hamin, 66, said of the announcement last week by Joseph R. Biden Jr. that he had chosen Ms. Harris as his running mate. In interviews with dozens of Black, Latina and Asian-American women, many said that in Ms. Harris’s life, they recognized both her triumphs and the challenges that come with living in a country wrestling with its history of discrimination. “It’s the twin devils of racism and sexism,” said Ms. Sanchez, 47, who lives near Ms. Harris’s childhood school. “We are told our whole lives to educate ourselves and work hard — God forbid it actually works, we get told we’re asking for too much.” — Audra D. S. Burch, Jennifer Medina and Evan Nicole Brown Hillary Clinton, whose presidential candidacy in 2016 sent Joseph R. Biden Jr. to the sidelines, spent much of the 2020 primaries telling friends that her longtime ally and onetime rival was the only contender who could defeat President Trump, according to people close to both. But she also saw Kamala Harris as a possible successor of sorts, a next-generation leader with the toughness to build on Mrs. Clinton’s legacy. So Mrs. Clinton is, by all accounts, reassured by the Biden-Harris ticket. But her return to center stage at the convention on Wednesday night, four years after becoming the first woman to win the nomination of a major party, is bittersweet. Had things turned out differently, Mrs. Clinton would be preparing her second acceptance speech. Instead, she has spent the last several days putting the finishing touches on a speech aimed at making a case for Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris. It’s a familiar position for Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state. For decades, she spoke on behalf of her husband, Bill, then to help elect Barack Obama. Over her many years at the center of the Democratic Party, she campaigned for hundreds of federal, state and local candidates. Yet this moment is uniquely emotional for Mrs. Clinton and the tens of millions who propelled her to a popular-vote majority of nearly three million in 2016, but a loss in the Electoral College. It is both a reminder of a job some allies still maintain was unfairly taken from Mrs. Clinton and the wave of feminist activism sparked by her loss. — Lisa Lerer and Glenn Thrush During their convention, Democrats have presented a unified front on racial justice, declaring that the status quo is not acceptable. But beneath the surface lies broad disagreement over policing, with the reform-oriented proposals of Joseph R. Biden Jr. falling well short of progressive activists’ demands. The gap was evident in a line Mr. Biden delivered during a discussion on the convention’s opening night: “Most cops are good, but the fact is, the bad ones need to be identified and prosecuted.” His words struck many activists as discordant at a moment when the police killing of George Floyd has spurred nationwide calls for rethinking law enforcement. Progressives say they see unprecedented momentum to transform policing that they can’t let slip away in an election year. “What I’m concerned about is the continued conversation about it being a few bad apples as opposed to systemic racism in the system,” said Jamaal Bowman, the Bronx Democrat who ousted the longtime Representative Eliot Engel in a June primary. “Part of our issue is recognizing that racism is not an individual-to-individual problem, it’s our system. It’s part of America’s DNA because we’ve never reckoned with our history of slavery.” — Reid J. Epstein and John Eligon Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, called on the Postal Service board of governors on Wednesday to release information about the selection process that led to Louis DeJoy becoming postmaster general in May, charging that the board had denied access to the information. The agency has blocked lawmakers from questioning Russell Reynolds, the firm involved in selecting Mr. DeJoy, by refusing to release the firm from a nondisclosure agreement, Mr. Schumer said. Mr. Schumer said his office had sought a briefing from Kimberly Archer, a leader of the firm’s global nonprofit practice, so “Congress could satisfy its oversight obligations to better understand the selection of Mr. DeJoy,” who is a former C.E.O. of a transportation-logistics company that does business with the Postal Service. In July, the board had deemed much of the information sought by lawmakers to be confidential, Mr. Schumer said. After budget cuts to the Postal Service slowed mail delivery, leading to fears that millions of people who plan to vote by mail this November because of the pandemic could be disenfranchised — especially after President Trump’s repeated criticisms of the practice — Mr. DeJoy said this week that further changes would be suspended until after the election. But Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said in a statement Wednesday that his “alleged pause is wholly insufficient and does not reverse damage already wreaked.” Separately, close to 100 House Democrats on Wednesday called for Mr. DeJoy’s removal, writing to the agency’s board of governors that he “has already done considerable damage to the institution and we believe his conflicts of interest are insurmountable.” — Emily Cochrane President Trump has sparred with Apple, Twitter, Nike — and now the tire maker Goodyear. Mr. Trump called on his supporters to boycott the company on Wednesday after a television station in Topeka, Kan., reported that employees at a local Goodyear plant had been barred from wearing political attire. The policy specifically mentioned that “Make America Great Again” Trump campaign merchandise was not acceptable. Don’t buy GOODYEAR TIRES - They announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS. Get better tires for far less! (This is what the Radical Left Democrats do. Two can play the same game, and we have to start playing it now!). In a photo that an employee told WIBW-TV was taken during a recent diversity-training presentation, a slide show says that plant employees are allowed to wear clothing promoting the Black Lives Matter movement and L.G.B.T. pride. The presentation seems to refer to a “zero tolerance” policy toward political clothing as well as “Blue Lives Matter” and “All Lives Matter” apparel. Goodyear did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday, but a company spokeswoman told WIBW that there was a distinction between clothing promoting racial equality and political apparel. “Goodyear is committed to fostering an inclusive and respectful workplace where all of our associates can do their best in a spirit of teamwork,” the spokeswoman, Melissa Monaco, told the station. “As part of this commitment, we do allow our associates to express their support on racial injustice and other equity issues but ask that they refrain from workplace expressions, verbal or otherwise, in support of political campaigning for any candidate or political party as well as other similar forms of advocacy that fall outside the scope of equity issues.” A photo of Mr. Trump riding in a presidential limousine with Goodyear tires soon started circulating on Twitter. — Neil Vigdor MIAMI — Representative Ross Spano narrowly lost his Republican primary on Tuesday, becoming the highest-profile Florida incumbent to lose his seat this year. Mr. Spano, an embattled freshman, lost by two percentage points to Commissioner Scott Franklin of Lakeland in a Republican-leaning district that sprawls across the northeastern Tampa suburbs. Mr. Spano, who had been dogged by investigations into campaign finance violations stemming from his 2018 campaign, becomes the eighth House incumbent — five Republicans and three Democrats — to lose a primary this year. Last year, Mr. Spano admitted misreporting over $100,000 in contributions that had actually come from friends as personal funds. Other Florida results from last night: In the Republican primary in President Trump’s home district, Laura Loomer, a self-described anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist, beat Christian Acosta, a nuclear engineer. Ms. Loomer, 27, a former contributor to the right-wing site Infowars who has called herself “a #ProudIslamophobe” and who was kicked off Twitter in 2018 for violating hate-speech rules, will take on Representative Lois Frankel, a four-term Democrat. Ms. Frankel is widely expected to win. Mr. Trump, who votes from Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, congratulated Ms. Loomer on Twitter: “Great going Laura. You have a great chance against a Pelosi puppet!” Kat Cammack, the former campaign manager of Representative Ted Yoho, won a 10-way Republican primary in a race to replace him in his safely red district. Mr. Yoho, who made headlines last month for insulting Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the Capitol steps, was not seeking re-election. In the Democratic primary in Mr. Spano’s district, Alan Cohn, a former TV news reporter, beat State Representative Adam Hattersley. And Sybrina Fulton, who became an activist against gun violence after the death of her son Trayvon Martin, lost in a close race for a seat on the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners to Oliver Gilbert, the mayor of Miami Gardens. In a Republican Senate primary in Wyoming, Cynthia Lummins, a former representative, won and is all but certain to replace Senator Michael B. Enzi, who is retiring. — Patricia Mazzei, Michael D. Shear and Andy Newman Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, who has largely been credited with rejuvenating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s struggling presidential campaign in February, said on Wednesday that the election stakes this year were comparable to those in 1860, when Abraham Lincoln was on the ballot. Mr. Clyburn, the House majority whip, made the remarks during a virtual breakfast hosted by the Pennsylvania Democratic Party on Zoom. He urged the state’s convention delegation to work tirelessly to elect Mr. Biden and said that they should dedicate their efforts in memory of his longtime friend and colleague, Representative John Lewis, the civil rights leader who died last month. “He understood what the consequence could be if we do not have a successful election this year,” Mr. Clyburn said. Mr. Clyburn provided a momentum-changing endorsement to Mr. Biden in late February in South Carolina’s Democratic primary, which many party insiders regarded as a moment of reckoning for Mr. Biden after his disappointing results in early nominating contests. Mr. Biden victory in South Carolina propelled him to triumphs in most of the Super Tuesday states. — Neil Vigdor Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, challenged Amy McGrath, his Democratic opponent, to a single Lincoln-Douglas-style debate in the coming weeks as he seeks to hold off her attempt to unseat him in one of the most closely watched Senate races this fall. “This would be a debate just between the two of us,” Mr. McConnell wrote in a letter to Ms. McGrath on Wednesday. “No notes at the table, no props and no audience. Kentuckians deserve clear answers from each of us on the issues that matter most, and this is the best format to deliver those answers.” Mr. McConnell noted that the session would have to be socially distanced and suggested the candidates agree on a neutral timekeeper and a local television station to broadcast the debate. But the terms — no moderator asking the candidates questions and just a single meeting — appeared conceived to give advantage to Mr. McConnell, a seasoned senator who has represented his state since 1985. Most major campaign debates in recent years feature moderators — usually journalists — who ask a rapid-fire series of questions on a wide range of topics and allow opportunities for only brief rebuttals. Inspired by a series of debates in 1858 between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas as the two men sought a United States Senate seat representing Illinois, the format suggested by Mr. McConnell leaves it to the candidates to more freely lay out their visions for policy and governing and then engage the arguments of their opponent more directly and at length. Ms. McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot who narrowly lost a Kentucky congressional seat in 2018, did not immediately reply to his offer. She faces long odds in trying to defeat Mr. McConnell, one of the most powerful Republicans in the country in a state Mr. Trump won by about 30 points in 2016. But Democrats have poured tens of millions of dollars into her campaign hoping to at least make the majority leader sweat, and public polling has showed the race may be tighter than previous challenges to Mr. McConnell. — Nicholas Fandos YUMA, Ariz. — President Trump on Tuesday accused Joseph R. Biden Jr. of seeking to throw open the United States’ borders to criminals and disease, using the backdrop of a border city to stoke fears of immigrants as Democrats prepared for the second day of the party’s nominating convention. Speaking at an airport hangar, Mr. Trump boasted about his own efforts to sharply limit immigration during his time in office, claiming to have made the country safer by blocking asylum seekers, refugees and other immigrants seeking to live and work in the United States. The president reprised the darkest language of his 2016 campaign, warning that should Mr. Biden win the presidency, the Trump-era restrictions on foreigners would be abandoned in favor of policies that he said would allow “aliens with criminal records” to roam free across the country, threatening violence and stealing jobs from Americans. “We’re talking about abolishing ICE. We’re talking about abolishing prisons,” Mr. Trump said to an enthusiastic but small crowd, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “Biden’s campaign has turned into a cult for open border and other zealots.” Mr. Trump’s anti-immigrant stance helped him win the election in 2016 and has been at the core of his presidency. He has denied entry to foreigners seeking protection from persecution, tried to end a program shielding from deportation young people brought to the United States illegally as children and cut back on legal immigration programs. — Michael D. Shear Amazon this week removed shirts from its online marketplace that used a derogatory word to refer to Senator Kamala Harris of California, the Democratic nominee for vice president, the company said on Wednesday. The shirts featured a fictitious campaign logo for Ms. Harris and Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, that referred to Ms. Harris using a slur associated with promiscuity. “All sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account,” an Amazon spokeswoman said in an email. “These products have been removed.” USA Today, which first reported on the step taken by Amazon, said that one seller, The Oxygen Bandit, sold T-shirts, tank tops, hoodies and sweatshirts with the phrase on its Amazon store. As of Wednesday afternoon, the store still had other products available mocking Mr. Biden, Ms. Harris and their campaign. Ms. Harris, a former attorney general of California and former San Francisco district attorney,  is the first Black woman and the first candidate of Indian descent to be on a major party’s presidential ticket. But Since Mr. Biden announced Ms. Harris as his running mate last week, she has been forced to endure attacks on her heritage and gender. Last week, President Trump perpetuated a racist conspiracy theory that is rampant among some of his followers: that Ms. Harris was not eligible for the vice presidency or presidency because her parents were immigrants. That assertion is false. Ms. Harris is eligible to serve. — Neil Vigdor The spouse of a political candidate often plays a crucial role in highlighting aspects of a candidate’s life that resonate with voters on a personal level. Dr. Jill Biden reinforced her husband’s folksiness and relatability, not only in the substance of her remarks, but through her fashion choices, according to The Times’s chief fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman. Dr. Biden, she wrote, “will not use fashion as a shield against the world. She will not gird herself in glamour, or arm herself with gilded European brand names. She is certainly not a trophy sitting on a shelf.” As the Democratic Party’s experiment in remote conventioning continued with Day 2 on Tuesday, Dr. Jill Biden brought the effort to present her husband, Joseph R. Biden Jr., as the anti-Trump in character and conviction to a personal close, and played her part in the drama. After all, if he is the presidential alternative, so she, too, is the current first lady’s. First lady is an odd role, as many historians have pointed out: unelected, yet also crucial to fleshing out the humanity of a president, and the parts of a candidate that resonate with voters. That’s why the spouse gets a keynote during the convention, and also why traditionally so much attention paid to what she wears: why, for example, her clothes can end up in a museum, and why the first lady is sometimes treated like the first influencer. (Why, when it comes time for a first man, his clothes will matter, too.) The first spouse is a key part of the image-making. A House candidate in Connecticut who was arrested on domestic violence charges on the day before last week’s Republican primary — allegations that party leaders first learned of in the spring but did not report to the authorities — lost a recount by 81 votes, state election officials said on Wednesday. The candidate, Thomas Gilmer, who Republicans endorsed in the spring, had been leading his opponent, Justin Anderson, by 17 votes before this week’s recount in the Second Congressional District. But Mr. Gilmer’s lead evaporated when local officials in Eastern Connecticut conducted the recount, which was automatically triggered because the margin was less than one-half of 1 percent. Mr. Gilmer was charged last Monday with strangulation and unlawful restraint in connection with a “possible domestic assault,” in 2017, the police in Wethersfield, a Hartford suburb, said in a statement. The altercation was recorded in a video that showed Mr. Gilmer punching a former girlfriend in the face and using his shirt to put her in a chokehold, several media outlets in the state reported, citing an arrest warrant affidavit. The video had been sent to Mr. Mr. Anderson, Mr. Gilmer’s opponent. Mr. Gilmer announced in a statement last week that he was suspending his campaign, but state election officials said that he did not formally withdraw from the race. His arrest has caused turmoil within the Connecticut Republican Party, which endorsed him in the spring and would have been stuck with him as its nominee had he won the recount. It has also raised questions about the party’s vetting of candidates, and led to a call by the top Republican female office holder in the state legislature for the party chairman to step down. — Neil Vigdor Updated Aug. 19, 2020 </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
