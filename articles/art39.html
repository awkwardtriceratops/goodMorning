Paris hospitals are feeling the strain from a new influx of patients. The U.S. economic outlook is bleak as Election Day approaches. Protests broke out in Orthodox Jewish areas over rules starting Thursday in Queens and Brooklyn. San Diego schools remove a Trump letter from food aid boxes, calling it misleading. As cases rise in Texas, its governor says bars can reopen. How do you lose an ‘S.N.L.’ gig? Ask Morgan Wallen. Boston is delaying the next step in its plan to reopen public school classrooms as the city’s rate of positive test results climbs. The district, which serves 54,000 students, making it one of the nation’s 100 largest, began the year with remote learning on Sept. 21 and planned to allow students to return to classrooms in phases, with most students given the option to attend school in-person two days a week. Last week, the city allowed a group of high-needs students, including some students with disabilities, students facing homelessness, and English language learners, to return to classrooms for the first time. Kindergarten students were expected to return as soon as Oct. 15, with older students moving into schools in waves over the following days. But Mayor Marty Walsh had said that the city would only allow in-person to continue if the seven-day average positivity rate citywide remained under 4 percent. In recent days, as the city has experienced an increase in cases, the positivity rate has topped that threshold. Mr. Walsh wrote on Twitter on Wednesday that the city would delay the return of kindergarten students, bringing them back no sooner than Oct. 22, and that it would continue to adjust its plans as needed based on new testing data. The citywide positive rate puts us just over the 4% threshold that we established for moving forward with our phased-in, hybrid learning plan for @BostonSchools. So we believe it is prudent at this time to pause the school reopening plan. He said that, based on the guidance of public health experts and in consultation with state officials, the city had decided that the high-needs students who started in-person learning last week could continue to go to school. “For many of these students, not being in school presents risk that cannot be mitigated the way that the risk of #COVID19 can be,” Mr. Walsh wrote. New York City completed reopening schools on a hybrid model last week, but 100 public schools, and roughly 200 private schools, have already been closed in areas that have seen sharp upticks in cases. Most other big cities are holding off on in-person schooling for now, but thousands of smaller districts have reopened, especially in the South and the Midwest. Massachusetts has seen a steady rise in coronavirus cases since early July, and some public health experts have urged Gov. Charlie Baker to roll back the state’s reopening process. — Kate Taylor President Trump, releasing a direct-to-camera video of himself addressing the nation, said Wednesday he would provide hundreds of thousands of doses of unapproved drugs to Americans free of charge. Mr. Trump said he considered getting ill with a virus that has killed more than one million people, including more than 211,000 Americans, a “blessing from God” because he ended up being given an experimental cocktail of drugs, still in clinical trials, that is produced by Regeneron. “I call that a cure,” said Mr. Trump, whose skin appeared darkened by makeup and who appeared to struggle to get air at times. It is impossible to know if the treatment has cured the president or even if he has beaten the disease. Most people with Covid-19 eventually recover, and medical experts have also said that Mr. Trump is most likely still battling it. The president said that everyone should have access to the as-yet-approved drug for “free” and that he would make sure it was in every hospital as soon as possible. He did not provide any details, other than saying the military could help distribute the drug. “Good luck,” Mr. Trump said, ending the video. — Maggie Haberman GLOBAL ROUNDUP More than 40 percent of patients hospitalized in intensive care units in the Paris region have Covid-19, the French authorities said this week, warning that local hospitals were coming under increasing strain from an influx of new cases. Over 2,300 Covid-19 patients are hospitalized in Ile-de-France, the region that includes the French capital and that is the country’s most populated. Nearly 450 of them are in intensive care, and some hospitals have started to defer surgeries to make additional room. Aurélien Rousseau, the head of the health authority for Ile-de-France, warned that Covid-19 patients could take up half of all intensive care units within the next 10 to 15 days if new restrictions put in place over the past week did not make an impact. The new restrictions in Paris include the closure of all bars for at least two weeks. Gyms, dance halls and enclosed swimming pools are also closed to adults, and university classrooms and lecture halls can operate only at half capacity or below. Restaurants can remain open if they follow a strict health protocol. Models from the Pasteur Institut, using data from Sept. 25, before any of the new restrictions were put in place, warned that the region’s intensive care units, at their current capacity, would be completely full with Covid-19 patients by November if nothing changed. Mr. Rousseau stressed the need for residents to further reduce social interactions. “It is demanding, but it’s the condition to limit the number of infections and to protect the health system,” he said on Twitter. France reported nearly 19,000 new daily cases on Wednesday, a record so far, as President Emmanuel Macron said that “we must go toward more restrictions” in regions where the epidemic was picking up speed, despite improvements in other areas. “We are not in a normal time, and we won’t be for several months,” Mr. Macron told French television on Wednesday evening. Mr. Macron did not detail how restrictions might be tightened, but the health minister is expected to announce any new measures at a news conference on Thursday evening. Nearly 7,400 people are hospitalized because of Covid-19 around France, including 1,400 people in intensive care. That is a far cry from the peak in April, when hospitals around the country had more than 32,000 Covid-19 patients, but a worrying increase since late August, when that number was around 4,500. Hospitals in other regions are also coming under increasing pressure from a rise in the number of infections, including the area around Marseille, in southern France, where restrictions had already been tightened last month, and in the northern Hauts-de-France region. In other news around Europe: Scotland will further tighten restrictions on its hospitality sector, closing pubs and canceling events around Glasgow, to avoid the likelihood of a second lockdown, the government said on Wednesday. Elsewhere in the country, pubs and restaurants will not be able to serve customers indoors after 6 p.m starting Friday. “We have a duty to balance all the different harms caused by the pandemic,” Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said, adding that without more restrictions, there was “a real risk the virus will run out of control by the end of this month.” Scotland reported over 1,000 new cases on Wednesday, with a dramatic spike in infections in those over the age of 70. The government will also provide £40 million in funding for businesses affected by the new measures. State governors in Germany agreed Wednesday to restrict domestic travelers from renting rooms if they are coming from a virus hot spot. Those who live in areas where cases surpass 50 per 100,000 people in a week are discouraged from non-essential travel and will have to present a negative test result to book a room in a hotel or resort. The news came as Germans prepared for their traditional two-week October school break, during which many families travel, and amid a rise in cases. The health authorities registered 2,828 new infections across Germany on Tuesday, a figure not seen in the country since April. Bars and restaurants in Berlin must also close at 11 p.m. starting this weekend. Members of the governments of Brussels and Wallonia, two out of three of Belgium’s regions, are in quarantine after two ministers tested positive for the virus. The news comes as Belgium implements rules limiting social interactions to three people outside of families in response to a rise in cases. The city of Brussels also announced on Wednesday that it would shut down all bars and cafes for a month. — Aurelien Breeden, Isabella Kwai and Christopher F. Schuetze President Trump returned to the Oval Office on Wednesday, even as a full picture of his health remained unclear and many of his aides were in quarantine amid a West Wing outbreak that continues to grow. White House officials said he went in for an update on the stimulus talks that he called off Tuesday. And two people close to the White House said advisers were exploring a resumption of travel events for the president next week. Despite the president’s insistence on returning to seeming normalcy, experts on the virus say he is entering a pivotal phase in the disease — seven to 10 days after the onset of symptoms — when some patients take a turn for the worse. Underscoring the potential dangers, a White House memo instructed staff members to follow new safety protocols, among them some that Mr. Trump has previously dismissed. They include surgical masks and protective eye covers. Many health experts believe West Wing outbreak is a result of White House officials ignoring precautions recommended by public health experts. Mr. Trump told the White House medical staff that he was feeling “great” and was symptom-free, according to a statement released Wednesday by his physician, Dr. Sean P. Conley. But Dr. Conley offered few further details about the president’s treatment, including whether he was still taking a steroid. Dr. Conley’s statement said Mr. Trump has not needed supplemental oxygen since returning from the hospital. But the full picture of the his health remains murky. Doctors, for instance, have not shared results of the president’s chest X-rays or lung scans, crucial measures of the severity of his illness. The president — trailing in the polls and just a month away from the election — is trying to project the image of a healthy leader, and not of a patient with Covid-19. He has said he plans to be at the next debate, on Oct. 15, when it is possible he could still be contagious. His opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., says there should not be a debate if the president still has the virus. Since leaving the hospital Monday evening, the president has returned to minimizing the seriousness of the pandemic — even as many states in the country are experiencing serious outbreaks. Montana and Oklahoma, where hospitals are strained, set single-day case records on Tuesday, according to a Times database. And Alaska, Indiana, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Utah and Wyoming reported more cases in the last week than they have during any seven-day period of the pandemic. — Eileen Sullivan and Maggie Haberman With less than a month to go before Election Day, the pandemic-driven economic outlook is not a good one. Job growth in the United States has stalled, layoffs are mounting, and there are no signs more financial help is coming anytime soon for families enduring hardships. Households and businesses have gone two months without the enhanced unemployment benefits, low-interest loans and other programs that helped prop up the economy in the spring. President Trump announced on Tuesday that he was cutting off stimulus negotiations until after the election. He later added confusion by urging Congress to act “IMMEDIATELY” to revive a lapsed loan program for small businesses and to approve funds for airlines and another round of stimulus checks. But the only talks that seemed to be moving forward at all on Wednesday were on airlines. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, spoke in the morning about the prospects of a stand-alone bill for airline relief. Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman has argued that failing to provide enough support carried risks for the economy. “Too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses,” he said in a speech on Tuesday. Already, many furloughs are turning into permanent job losses, and major companies like Disney and Allstate are embarking on new rounds of layoffs. The hotel industry is warning of thousands of closures, and tens of thousands of small businesses are weighing whether to close up shop for good. An estimated one of every seven small businesses in the United States had shut down permanently by the end of August — 850,000 in all — according to data from Womply, a marketing platform. The deeper those wounds, the longer the economy will take to heal. After President Trump indicated that he might want to revive some stimulus measures, stocks on Wall Street rose on Wednesday, broadly erasing Tuesday’s losses. The bounce was just the latest in a series of head-spinning turns for the market. The gridlock in Washington is a reversal from the spring, when lawmakers acted out of fear of an imminent economic collapse and approved trillions of dollars in aid to households and businesses. The effort was largely successful. But most of the aid programs expired over the summer, and in recent weeks economic gains have faltered. Economists across the ideological spectrum agree that the loss of momentum is likely to get worse if more aid doesn’t arrive soon. — Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley The California governor’s office wants people who dine in restaurants to put their masks back on their faces “in between bites.” The recommendation appears to contradict advice from the World Health Organization, which warns mask wearers to avoid touching their masks as much as possible, and to wash their hands before and after touching it — hardly practical to do at a dining table between mouthfuls. The tweet on the subject issued by the office of Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday also seemed to contradict itself. An accompanying graphic instructs diners to “minimize the number of times you take your mask off.” An illustration shows a diner wearing her mask while perusing a menu, maskless while taking a bite, and then wearing the mask again with an empty plate. Going out to eat with members of your household this weekend? Don't forget to keep your mask on in between bites.

Do your part to keep those around you healthy. #SlowtheSpreadhttps://t.co/snYe5v55Rw pic.twitter.com/Y4fcDO5Zke The unusual and confusing suggestion to take the mask on and off repeatedly throughout a meal attracted mockery online. “It’s confirmed, I live in the dumbest state,” one Twitter user responded. As most states do in some form, California requires mask-wearing in public spaces. Many counties in the state restrict restaurants to outdoor seating only, or limit their indoor seating to 25 percent of capacity. The state has reported more than 840,000 cases of the virus so far, and more than 16,000 deaths, according to a New York Times database. Experts have taken different approaches to mask-wearing while dining out. In an interview with “The Daily Show” last month, Dr. Anthony Fauci said he wears his mask around his neck while eating and drinking in public, and then places it over his face “while you’re waiting for the waiter” or during other lulls in the meal. — Ruth Graham Orthodox Jewish and other religious leaders lashed out at Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Wednesday over new coronavirus restrictions on schools, businesses and houses of worship, as protests broke out in Brooklyn overnight, leading to scenes of chaos and the injury of at least one person. The new restrictions, announced by Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday, are intended to combat worrisome outbreaks of the coronavirus in Brooklyn, Queens and New York City’s northern suburbs.  The rules would shut down nonessential businesses and schools and impose tight restrictions on houses of worship, where attendance in the hardest-hit areas would be limited to 10 people. In other neighborhoods, attendance would be limited to 25 people. On Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City said that the restrictions in portions of Brooklyn and Queens, as outlined by the state, would go into effect on Thursday. The rules — which will be put in place before an important Jewish holiday, Shemini Atzeret — seem to specifically target Orthodox synagogues that have become scenes of large gatherings of worshipers clustered together, with many not wearing face coverings. The number of virus cases in the affected areas of Brooklyn and Queens has been rising for weeks, especially in Orthodox Jewish communities. Local leaders said that surge was driven by denialism, wishful thinking around herd immunity and misinformation. Other religious leaders from communities affected by the new rules were also outraged. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, which has 1.5 million followers and 210 churches in Brooklyn and Queens, said it was taken by surprise by the governor’s announcement. Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio of Brooklyn condemned the new rules as “outrageous.” Orthodox Jewish leaders, who also said they were not consulted before the governor announced the new restrictions, said they were “appalled” by the action. In a letter posted late Tuesday from four Orthodox Jewish lawmakers representing the affected areas  said Mr. Cuomo “has chosen to pursue a scientifically and constitutionally questionable shutdown of our communities.” Their frustration was reflected on the street, where video shared widely on social media showed hundreds of Hasidic men, most of them without masks, gathering after midnight and setting fires along 13th Avenue in the Borough Park neighborhood. The crowd soon turned violent. One man can be heard yelling “Snitch!” in a video as the crowd beats a man the mob believed to be disloyal. On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo said that he sympathized with those who were upset with the restrictions. But, he added, “these limitations are better than going back to close down.” “To the extent there are communities that are upset, that’s because they haven’t been following the original rules,” the governor said. “And that’s why the infection spread — because they weren’t following the rules. And the rules weren’t being enforced.” At his own news conference, Mr. de Blasio said that the restrictions do not include the Crown Heights and Williamsburg neighborhoods of Brooklyn, two areas which have seen smaller increases in their virus positivity rates than areas subject to restrictions. He added that the city planned to continue monitoring those areas. “I understand that there are people who disagree with this plan,” Mr. de Blasio said, noting the restrictions may be tough for different groups. “But it’s crucial that those who disagree still respect the fact that the state and city have made a decision for the health and safety of all.” Statewide, the daily positivity rate was 1.25 percent, the governor said. He also reported that hospitalizations in the state had increased again, to 748, a rise he described as “seeing the hot spot clusters adding to hospitalization at over three times their population rate.” The mayor reported the seven-day average rate of positive test results citywide was 1.74 percent. — Liam Stack, Troy Closson and Michael Gold Recruiting Black volunteers for coronavirus vaccine trials during a period of severe mistrust of the federal government and heightened awareness of racial injustice is a formidable task. So far, only about 3 percent of the people who have signed up nationally are Black. Yet never has their inclusion in a medical study been more urgent. The economic and health impacts of the coronavirus are falling disproportionately hard on communities of color. It is essential, public health experts say, that research reflect diverse participation not only as a matter of social justice and sound practice but, when the vaccine becomes available, to help persuade Black, Latino and Native American people to actually get it. Trials for vaccines developed by the drug companies Moderna and AstraZeneca are being conducted at local sites across the country, including the University of Pittsburgh. Academic researchers are turning to neighborhood leaders to attract more diverse pools of participants. Rev. Paul Abernathy, 41, an Orthodox Christian priest and Iraq War veteran who is Black, has been sending his organization’s “community health deputies” into struggling neighborhoods, offering masks to young people hanging out on corners and picking up food and medicine for older people. Now they’re recruiting for the vaccine trials, trying to counter deep skepticism built on present disparities as well as a long history of abuse. “I won’t be used as a guinea pig for white people,” one tenant in a predominantly Black public housing complex declared after hearing their pitch. To Father Paul, Covid-19 is one more deadly trauma in a litany that has shaken Black neighborhoods. People come to his organization seeking food, health care and clothes and wind up talking about stabbings, overdoses, robberies, fires, domestic violence. “There is a great deal that is against us,” Father Paul said on a recent morning. “And we have to be honest about that. Our community needs more than what we have. But with a good spirit and a willing heart, miracles can happen.” — Jan Hoffman New England Patriots star cornerback Stephon Gilmore, the league’s defensive player of the year in 2019, has tested positive for the coronavirus, forcing the team to cancel practice Wednesday as N.F.L. infections continue to climb despite health protocols. Gilmore was revealed to have tested positive two days after the league put into place new measures meant to halt the spread of infections. They include video surveillance of players and team personnel to ensure mask-wearing, a prohibition against traveling during bye weeks and a limit on the number of free-agent tryouts. On Monday, the Patriots played at Kansas City, a game that had been pushed back a day after quarterback Cam Newton and a Chiefs practice squad quarterback, Jordan Ta’amu, also tested positive. With no new positive tests emerging for either team on Sunday or Monday, the league staged the game on Monday night, with the Patriots chartering two planes — one for players who had been in contact with Newton, another for those who hadn’t — to travel. Now, the new positive test may put the Patriots’ home game Sunday against the Denver Broncos in peril. On Wednesday, the Tennessee Titans, who have been grappling with an outbreak for more than a week, learned that two more players had tested positive, bring their total of players and employees who have tested positive since Sept. 24 to 22. And in Florida, the Miami Dolphins said they had no plans to play games before a full-capacity Hard Rock Stadium, despite being cleared to do so. A spokesman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday that the team was free to host home games with a maximum number of spectators in attendance — 65,000 — if they chose. Tom Garfinkel, the Dolphins' chief executive, said the team was keeping the cap at 13,000. “We’ll continue to follow C.D.C. guidelines and put everyone’s safety first and monitor things as we go,” he said. — Ken Belson and Ben Shpigel The first time New Zealand thought it had eliminated the coronavirus from its isolated shores, a mysterious outbreak in its largest city shattered any sense of victory over a tenacious foe. Now, after a second round of strict lockdown, the country believes — if a bit more tentatively this time — that it has effectively stamped out the virus once again. On Wednesday, New Zealand moved to lift the last of its restrictions in Auckland after 10 days with no new cases linked to a cluster that first surfaced in August. The government will now allow unrestricted gatherings, and trips on public transit without social distancing or masks, in the city of 1.6 million people. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who is facing re-election next week, called the reopening a validation of the country’s “go hard, go early” response. The strategy is aimed at eradicating the virus with a swift science-based policy, one that trades weeks of lockdown and sacrifice for an emergence to full economic activity. “Our team of five million, a little more battle-weary this time, did what national teams do so often. We put our heads down, and we got on with it,” Ms. Ardern told reporters in Christchurch on Monday as she announced that the restrictions would be loosened, referring to the total number of people in New Zealand. “You only had to look around the world to see the alternative to our approach here in New Zealand,” she said, adding that there was a 95 percent probability that the country had eliminated local transmission of the virus. Experts cautioned that New Zealand’s small population and isolation meant it was uniquely positioned to manage the disease. But its success presents a stark contrast to many other parts of the world as deaths from the pandemic have surpassed one million. — Livia Albeck-Ripka With reduced financial support from the British government, colleges and universities are pushing to stay open to retain tuition and room fees and placing students into severe lockdowns even as  coronavirus infections rise in their dorms. Students at Manchester Metropolitan University have taken to calling one of their residences H.M.P., for Her Majesty’s Prison, because of strict protocols that have left trash piled up in shared kitchens and students washing their clothes in bathroom sinks. Security guards stalked the gates, keeping anyone from leaving or entering. Parties at the beginning of the school year led to the virus tearing though student suites, and the university largely left students on their own: It imposed such a draconian lockdown that students had to nurse roommates back to health, parents drove hours to deliver food and lawyers offered pro bono help. The outbreaks have shone a harsh light on Britain’s decade-long campaign to turn higher education into a ruthless market. Cuts in state grants left schools dependent on tuition fees and room rents, leading them to jam more students onto campuses. For Britain, where the Covid-19 death toll stands at 58,000, the highest in Europe, the pandemic has forced a reckoning with the government’s treatment of higher education, even as the country’s universities make crucial advances in the race for a vaccine. “Students are money in the bank, and as long as we’re on campus they’ll worry about the consequences later,” said Aslan Warburton, a freshman at Manchester Metropolitan. “The financial side has taken priority over student well-being and the greater good.” — Benjamin Mueller As President Trump returned from the hospital, still telling Americans not to be afraid of Covid-19, the coronavirus has exploded in North Dakota. In the past week, North Dakota reported more new cases per capita than any other state. Hospitalizations for the virus have risen abruptly, forcing health care officials in some towns to send people to faraway hospitals, even across state lines to Montana and South Dakota. Officials have huddled with hospital leaders in recent days to contemplate ways to free up more hospital beds even as they contend with broader turmoil over virus policy in a state that has seen resignations of three state health officers since the pandemic’s start. The rise in cases and deaths — September was by far the deadliest month for North Dakota since the start of the pandemic — reflects a new phase of the virus in the United States. States in the Midwest and Great Plains, many of which had avoided large outbreaks in earlier months when coastal cities were hard hit, are seeing the brunt. And in rural portions of the hardest-hit states, medical resources are quickly stretched thin for residents who can live hours from large hospitals. Still, partly because these outbreaks were slow in coming, public health officials say they have struggled to convince the public that the situation is urgent or that limits like mask rules make sense. North Dakota is one of fewer than 20 states with no statewide mask mandate and many counties have resisted restrictions. But as the state reaches a boiling point, health officials say they hope people now will start to take the virus more seriously. “If there’s anything that should get our population’s attention, it’s this: how perilously close we are to the edge,” Vern Dosch, who leads contact tracing efforts for North Dakota, said last week. — Lucy Tompkins Dr. William Foege, a legendary figure in public health circles who served both Democratic and Republican presidents, has written an extraordinary private letter to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calling on him to expose the Trump administration’s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic — even if it means getting fired. In the Sept. 23 letter, obtained and published Tuesday evening by USA Today, Dr. Foege, who served as director of the C.D.C. under former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, called on the current director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, to admit to the administration’s failures or risk presiding over the ruin of the public health agency’s reputation, and his own. “Dear Bob, I start each day thinking about the terrible burden you bear,” he began, making clear that this was not the first conversation the two men have had about the administration’s response and Dr. Redfield’s role in it. “As I have indicated to you before, resigning is a one-day story and you will be replaced,” Dr. Foege wrote, adding that if Dr. Redfield remained silent, the White House would simply “blame you for the disaster” and move on. He suggested another course: “You could, upfront, acknowledge the tragedy of responding poorly, apologize for what has happened and your role in acquiescing, set a course for how C.D.C. would now lead the country if there was no political interference.” “Don’t shy away from the fact this has been an unacceptable toll on our country,” he added. “It is a slaughter and not just a political dispute.” Dr. Foege, 84, has worked in the field for more than half a century. He is credited with devising the strategy that led to the successful eradication of smallpox in the 1970s, and played a key role in improving immunization rates in developing countries in the 1980s. He told Dr. Redfield he needed to lift morale at the C.D.C. and restore the agency’s reputation. “When they fire you,” he concluded, “this will be a multi-week story and you can hold your head high. That will take exceptional courage on your part. I can’t tell you what to do except to revisit your religious beliefs and ask yourself what is right.” — Sheryl Gay Stolberg The Italian government announced a new order making face masks mandatory around the country on Wednesday, including in outdoor areas when social distancing cannot be maintained, in an effort to stem a second wave of virus cases. The decree, proposed by the Cabinet, was approved in Parliament on Wednesday despite opposition from right-wing lawmakers. Over 40 members of the body were themselves in quarantine this week, after three members tested positive for the virus. The mask rule will also be extended to indoor private spaces, including offices. Children under the age of six and people practicing sports will be exempt. Italy has reported 17,252 cases over the last seven days, far fewer than France, Britain, and Russia, among other countries. While the numbers remain far below the devastating first wave in the spring, the country has seen cases rise 58 percent over the last two weeks, raising concern among health experts. A detailed map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with charts and tables of the number of cases and deaths. — Gaia Pianigiani The Food and Drug Administration released updated, stricter guidelines on Tuesday for coronavirus vaccine developers — a step that was blocked for two weeks by top White House officials. The guidelines make it highly unlikely that a vaccine could be authorized by Election Day. The move, which was cleared by the Office of Management and Budget, appeared to be an abrupt reversal a day after The New York Times reported that White House officials, including Mark Meadows, the chief of staff, were blocking the guidelines. The new recommendations, which do not carry the force of law, call for gathering comprehensive safety data in the final stage of clinical trials before an emergency authorization can be granted. On Tuesday evening, President Trump showed his displeasure at the action of his own White House, and charged that the new guidelines were a conspiracy against his re-election prospects. “New F.D.A. Rules make it more difficult for them to speed up vaccines for approval before Election Day. Just another political hit job!” he tweeted, tagging Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the F.D.A. commissioner. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the F.D.A. has said that it has been seeking ways to accelerate the development of vaccines without sacrificing safety. In June, the agency released an initial set of guidelines to give vaccine developers a better idea of how the F.D.A. would decide if a vaccine were acceptable, either for an emergency use authorization or for a full license. Four vaccines have reached the final stage of testing, known as a Phase 3 trial, in the United States. A fifth is expected to start this month. President Trump has repeatedly suggested that a vaccine would be ready by Election Day, if not before. A look at all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans. But with public confidence declining in opinion polls about what could be a rushed coronavirus vaccine, the F.D.A. submitted a new set of guidelines to the White House for approval on Sept. 21. Among the recommendations, the agency advised vaccine makers to follow volunteers for a median of two months after the final dose. The F.D.A. also expected vaccine makers to document five cases of severe infection in people who received the placebo instead of the vaccine. The White House objected that the guidelines would add more time before a vaccine could be authorized. The F.D.A., however, continued to share parts of this guidance with vaccine developers in response to questions they submitted to the agency. On Tuesday, the F.D.A. published the guidelines at the end of a document the F.D.A. prepared for the meeting on Oct. 22 of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. The committee will be discussing the development, authorization and licensing of Covid vaccines. — Carl Zimmer and Noah Weiland When shipments of federal food aid for needy families arrive at the San Diego Unified School District, workers open each box. The milk, eggs and other perishables go in refrigeration until they can be distributed. The letters signed by President Trump go in the recycling. The boxes are part of the Department of Agriculture’s Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, which purchases food from local suppliers who have lost business because of the pandemic and distributes it free through food banks and school districts. Beginning this month, the boxes started arriving with the presidential letters inside as well. In English and Spanish, they offer advice on coronavirus safety, including hand washing, staying home when sick, protecting older people and maintaining social distance. But the district superintendent, Cindy Marten, says the letters are misleading — especially where they say that recipients should merely “consider” wearing a face covering when in public. Ms. Marten noted that masks are mandatory in California. And her district, she said, has a large Hispanic population that has been hit disproportionately hard both by the virus and by unemployment from the economic shutdown. “This is, for us, very important in terms of public health: to protect our local families from being misled on how to best safeguard themselves,” Ms. Marten said. “People now, more than ever, need clear messages from our leaders. And as the leader of the second-largest district, it’s important to me that we have clear messaging.” Two-thirds of the district’s students receive some kind of food assistance through the schools. Since the start of the pandemic, Ms. Marten said, the district has distributed five million meals through its regular food program. She said workers processed 850 of the Farmers to Families food boxes from the federal coronavirus aid program on Wednesday — and recycled the 850 letters. Some food banks around the country have also been removing the letters, and have accused Mr. Trump of trying to use the food aid program for partisan political gain, The Washington Post reported. — Lucy Tompkins Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas announced Wednesday that bars would be allowed to resume business next week in a limited capacity, pushing the state closer to a full reopening even as coronavirus cases and hospitalizations have been going up. Bars in Texas were one of the last establishments to remain shuttered as Mr. Abbott steadily relaxed a number of restrictions and reopened other businesses, including retail shops, hair salons and restaurants. The governor included a warning with his announcement. “Opening bars does not mean that Covid-19 is no longer a threat, and most Texans are still susceptible to the virus,” Mr. Abbott said in a statement. New cases, hospitalizations and deaths spiked in Texas after Mr. Abbott reopened the state in phases starting on May 1. By June he had paused the reopening and ordered bars to close again. As the situation improved, Mr. Abbott eased restrictions on many businesses but kept the bar closure in place, frustrating bar owners and their supporters, many of whom organized demonstrations, Some bars reopened illegally to protest the shutdown and joined lawsuits against the Republican governor. On Wednesday, Mr. Abbott said bars could reopen starting next Wednesday at up to 50-percent capacity. Dance floors must remain closed, tables will be limited to six people, and all patrons must wear masks when not seated at a table. Bar reopenings may be limited, however, by Mr. Abbott’s decision to involve local officials in signing off on them. Some bar owners are not enthusiastic about the governor’s order because they do not believe that some local officials will rush to allow them to reopen, said Greg Barrineau, who owns two bars in the San Antonio area and is a board member of the Texas Bar and Nightclub Alliance. Those officials, he said, worry that people can forget to social-distance when they drink. “But we in the bar business are very good at controlling and managing people that drink,” Mr. Barrineau said. “That’s what we do every day that we’re open.” Texas had led the nation in new cases in the past seven days, according to a New York Times database, with more than 30,000 cases. — Manny Fernandez and David Montgomery The pandemic has killed more than one million people around the world, including at least 210,000 in the United States alone.

On today’s episode of “The Daily,” we offer an update on measures to fight the coronavirus and try to predict the outbreak’s course, with Donald G. McNeil Jr., a science and health reporter for The New York Times. He says the virus “is not going to be over by fall” but that there are reasons for optimism about a vaccine and other interventions. — The New York Times Morgan Wallen, a country musician who was scheduled to perform on “Saturday Night Live” this weekend, won’t be appearing on the show after all, citing its coronavirus protocols. Mr. Wallen made the announcement Wednesday in an Instagram post after he was seen in videos last weekend showing him celebrating in Tuscaloosa after a football victory by the University of Alabama. In these clips, which appeared on TikTok and elsewhere, Mr. Wallen can be seen drinking shots, kissing fans and mingling in groups while not wearing a mask or following other social-distancing guidelines. In the video he posted to Instagram on Wednesday, Mr. Wallen said that he was speaking from a hotel room in New York. “I got a call from the show letting me know that I will no longer be able to play, and that’s because of Covid protocols, which I understand,” Wallen said. “I’m not positive for Covid, but my actions this past weekend were pretty shortsighted and they have obviously affected my long-term goals and my dreams. ” “Saturday Night Live,” which is broadcast from NBC’s headquarters in Rockefeller Plaza, halted its live episodes in March amid the pandemic.
