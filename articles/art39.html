As with any illness, there are frequent ups and downs over the course, particularly when a patient is being so closely watched. Over the course of his illness, the president has experienced two episodes of transient drops in his oxygen saturation. We debated the reasons for this, and whether we’d even intervene. It was the determination of the team based predominantly on the timeline from the initial diagnosis that we initiate dexamethasone. I’d like to take this opportunity now, given some speculation over the course of the illness the last couple of days, update you on the course of his own illness: Thursday night into Friday morning, when I left the bedside, the president was doing well with only mild symptoms and his oxygen was in the high 90s. Late Friday morning, when I returned to the bedside, the president had a high fever and his oxygen saturation was transiently dipping below 94 percent. Given these two developments, I was concerned for possible rapid progression of the illness. I recommended [to] the president we try some supplemental oxygen [and] see how he’d respond. He was fairly adamant that he didn’t need it. He was not short of breath. He was tired, had the fever and that was about it. And after about a minute on only two liters, his saturation levels were back over 40 — over 95 percent.” “Today he feels well. He’s been up and around or plan for today is to have him to eat and drink, be up out of bed as much as possible to be mobile. And if he continues to look and feel as well as he does today, our hope is that we can plan for a discharge as early as tomorrow to the White House where he can continue his treatment course.” “Dr. Conley, you said there were two instances where he had drops in oxygen. Can you walk us through the second one?” “Yeah, yesterday there was another episode where he dropped down, about 93 percent. He doesn’t ever feel short of breath. We watched it, and it returned back up.” [crosstalk] “Why did it take until today to disclose that the president had been administered oxygen?” “That’s a good question. Thank you. I was trying to reflect the upbeat attitude that the team, the president, that his course of illness, has had. I didn’t want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction. And in doing so, it came off that we were trying to hide something, which wasn’t necessarily true. And so I have, here I have it. He is — the fact of the matter is is that he’s doing really well.” President Trump’s medical team delivered an update on Sunday of his condition, as the president’s personal physician acknowledged delivering an overly rosy of his illness a day earlier. The details of the briefing signaled to some health experts that the president’s condition might be more serious than a mild case of Covid-19. “I didn’t want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction, and in doing so, you know, it came off that we were trying to hide something, which wasn’t necessarily true,” Dr. Sean P. Conley, the White House physician, said in a briefing with reporters Sunday. The doctors said that Mr. Trump had a “high fever” on Friday, and that there had been two incidents when his oxygen levels dropped — one on Friday and one on Saturday. They said Mr. Trump received oxygen at the White House on Friday; they were not clear about whether it was administered again on Saturday. Medical experts said that despite the relatively upbeat tone of the news conference Sunday, the details of his treatment and the fact that his oxygen levels have been dropping showed that the illness has progressed beyond a mild case of Covid-19. Mr. Trump’s oxygen levels dropped to 93 percent at one point, his doctors said; that is below the 95 percent level that is considered the lower limit of the normal range. Many medical experts consider patients to have severe Covid-19 if their oxygen levels drop below 94 percent. “This is no longer aspirationally positive,” said Dr. Esther Choo, a professor of emergency medicine at Oregon Health & Science University. “And it’s much more than just an ‘abundance of caution’ kind of thing.” Dr. Conley said that the president had been given the steroid dexamethasone on Saturday, in addition to remdesivir, an antiviral drug. Dexamethasone has been shown to help patients who are severely ill with Covid-19, but it is typically not used in mild or moderate cases of the disease. “He got the therapies that anybody going into any good hospital in the United States would receive today,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, a professor of medicine at Emory University in Atlanta. He said even if Mr. Trump is discharged from the hospital, “He’s not going to your house or my house, he’s going to the White House.” The White House is equipped with a medical suite. The World Health Organization issued guidelines on Sept. 2 recommending that dexamethasone only be given to patients with “severe and critical Covid-19.” The National Institutes of Health has issued similar guidance, specifying that the drug is recommended only for people who require a mechanical ventilator to help them breathe, or who need supplemental oxygen. A large study of dexamethasone in Britain found that the drug helped those who had been sick for more than a week, reducing deaths by one-third among patients on mechanical ventilators and by one-fifth among patients receiving supplemental oxygen by other means. On Friday, Mr. Trump was given an infusion of an experimental antibody cocktail that is being tested by the drug maker Regeneron. Mr. Trump is also receiving a five-day course of remdesivir, another experimental drug that is used in hospitalized patients and has been granted emergency authorization by the Food and Drug Administration. Regeneron’s antibody cocktail is being tested early in the course of the infection, because it fights the virus itself and could prevent it from spreading throughout the body. Remdesivir is also an antiviral drug, but has been commonly used along with dexamethasone, which reduces the body’s immune response and is given later in the illness, when some people’s immune systems go into overdrive and attack their vital organs. Even though he has had low-oxygen episodes and is receiving dexamethasone, the doctors said Mr. Trump was doing better and might be discharged from the hospital and return to the White House as early as Monday. The briefing came a day after a messy and contradictory presentation on Friday about whether Mr. Trump had serious medical issues. — Katie Thomas and Maggie Haberman Vice President Mike Pence, who would be the most powerful man in the nation should President Trump become too ill to continue his duties, has been on the campaign trail despite having been in close contact with the president and being at high risk of having the virus himself. “There is no way under the sun that Pence should be anywhere but in his home,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, an infectious disease expert at Harvard University. “He was sitting in a sea of people with Covid; there is no way he should go anywhere.” Mr. Pence and Karen Pence, the second lady, tested negative for the coronavirus for a third day on Sunday, a senior administration official said. They have been tested every day since Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for the coronavirus, which officials have said was Thursday. But it is possible to test negative and still be infected early in the course of the virus. Mr. Pence is scheduled to debate Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, in Salt Lake City, Utah, on Wednesday. Mr. Pence was last in contact with the president on Tuesday morning at the White House. He may have also been in close contact with several others who tested positive after having attended the White House event last Saturday to announce the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Mr. Trump began feeling symptoms as early as Wednesday, and several studies have shown that people are most infectious from one to two days before showing symptoms to about two days after. This could mean that Mr. Trump was already highly infectious on Tuesday. And it puts Mr. Pence and anyone who came into contact with Mr. Trump on Tuesday squarely at risk. Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, who helped the president at the White House with debate preparation from last Saturday through Tuesday, has tested positive. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is also at risk of being infected, experts say. Although he and Mr. Trump stood more than 12 feet apart at the debate, they were indoors. Studies have shown that indoors, the virus can travel farther than six feet, prompting experts to recommend that Mr. Biden also quarantine and get tested daily. Mr. Biden has continued to campaign, traveling to Grand Rapids, Mich., on Friday, and holding a virtual town hall with a union on Saturday. He is usually seen wearing a mask at campaign events. Mr. Pence, meanwhile, has traveled to several states and participated in outdoor and indoor campaign events. On Wednesday, he attended a packed fund-raiser in Atlanta, and on Thursday spoke at two indoor events in Iowa. He did not wear a mask on either day, nor did most attendees. Mr. Pence’s team has said that he tested negative for the coronavirus on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. But tests for the virus can produce false negatives if used too early in the course of infection. The virus can take up to 14 days to show symptoms, which is why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone who has been in close contact with an infected person quarantine for 14 days. Trump campaign officials said Sunday that Mr. Pence had no plans to curtail his public appearances. “He will be hitting the trail,” Jason Miller, the campaign’s senior adviser, told CNN. “And he’s going to have a very full, aggressive schedule.” Donald McNeil Jr. contributed reporting. — Apoorva Mandavilli The White House has not sought help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to trace the contacts of people who attended a celebration in the Rose Garden on Sept. 26 for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, according to a federal official familiar with the matter. Dr. Sean Conley, the White House physician, told reporters on Saturday that his team was working with the agency to trace contacts. But according to the federal official, while the C.D.C. had a team of experts on standby to help the White House, it has not been approached to do so. In an interview Sunday on the CBS program “Face the Nation,” Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, also offered evidence suggesting that no robust contact tracing effort was underway. Dr. Gottlieb said he had spoken to several officials who attended the Rose Garden event and who had not been spoken to by any contact tracers. “I think they have an obligation to understand how the infection was introduced into that environment,” he said of the White House. “There doesn’t seem to be a very concerted effort underway.” The celebration of Judge Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court on Saturday is looking more and more like a “super spreader event.” At least seven attendees, including President Trump and Melania Trump, have already tested positive. Some attendees have since tested negative, but that does not necessarily mean they are not infected. Negative results are common early in the course of infection, when the levels of virus in the body are still low. For that reason, C.D.C. guidelines recommend that anyone who has been in close contact with an infected person should stay in quarantine for two weeks even if they test negative. Since a Sept. 26 celebration for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, at least seven attendees have tested positive for the virus. The lack of attention to contact tracing could have devastating consequences for the hundreds of people who have come into proximity with those who may have become infected on Saturday. Any of them could have caught the virus and gone on to transmit it to many more people. Since Saturday, President Trump has debated former Vice President Joe Biden, spoken at a rally attended by thousands of people in Minnesota, met with supporters at a golf club in New Jersey and conferred with dozens of aides at the White House, all while not wearing a mask. Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey who helped the president prepare for Tuesday’s debate, has tested positive and been hospitalized. The C.D.C. has experts who are trained in contact tracing and could have immediately put an operation into place to trace contacts of President Trump and others who have been infected. The experts would have worked with health departments of the states in which incidents occurred. In the case of the White House, “we would help if we were asked,” the official said. But no such request came through, he said: “We don’t get involved unless we’re asked to get involved.” A visual guide to the president’s movements and contacts in the days before he announced his positive test for the coronavirus. — Apoorva Mandavilli TRANSCRIPT I’m going to be giving an update that gives me no joy at all. In fact, it pains me to be putting forward this approach that we’ll need. But in some parts of our city, in Brooklyn and Queens, we’re having an extraordinary problem, something we haven’t seen since the spring. And we have to address this issue forthrightly. That’s why we’re here on a Sunday after several days of continuing to review all the data, look at everything from the point of view that has gotten us this far as a city, always relying on the data and the science. What has become clear is that there are a number of neighborhoods now that have continued to have a high level of coronavirus positivity and that requires stronger action than we’ve had to take for many months. So the plan is to rewind in these nine zip codes. To rewind, to go back, to address the problem by using the tools that we know work, which is to ensure that non-essential businesses are not open and a variety of activities are not happening. Again, no joy in saying that. But that, unfortunately, we do know is what is necessary to stop the spread of the coronavirus. In a sharp reversal, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Sunday that he would seek state permission to shut down a variety of business and schools in nine ZIP codes in Brooklyn and Queens where tests have shown a positivity rate of 3 percent or more for the past seven days. The move by the mayor — which must be approved by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo — is the clearest indication of concern by city leaders over the possibility of a second wave in the city, which was ravaged by the virus in the spring, when more than 20,000 people died. The mayor’s plan would shut down indoor dining in those nine areas, many of which have large populations of Orthodox Jews. The virus has been spreading rapidly in those communities in recent weeks. The new shutdown would take effect on Wednesday, if approved by Mr. Cuomo. In addition, 11 other neighborhoods where rates of infection have hovered between 2 and 3 percent will be required to close “high-risk activities,” among them indoor dining, swimming pools and gyms. It was only last week that the city reopened indoor dining, with restaurants limited to 25 percent capacity. The city’s public schools also welcomed back students, in a bold attempt to restart in-person learning in the nation’s largest school district. Earlier on Sunday, Mr. Cuomo said that the state would begin “direct enforcement” in 20 ZIP codes this week where the virus is now spiking, using the state police and other state employees to monitor businesses, schools and houses of worship for possible violations. “We know how to deal with a hot spot,” he said. “But you have to deal with a hot spot.” The governor made no mention of immediate closings, despite rates of infection topping 10 percent in three separate areas in Orange and Rockland Counties, north of the city. One area, in Orange County, which includes Kiryas Joel, an Orthodox community, topped 20 percent over a three-day average, according to statistics released on Sunday by the state. In a statement issued later, the governor said that while “the state cannot take over effective enforcement for every jurisdiction,” it would be ready to act if notified by local authorities. And, he added, “we will close all business activity in the hot spots where the local governments cannot do compliance.”. New York remains the hardest-hit state in the nation, with more than 32,000 deaths. — Jesse McKinley Since the moment shortly before 1 a.m. on Friday when President Trump first revealed to the nation that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, conflicting information offered by his doctors and aides has added confusion to an already anxious moment, leaving Americans to wonder whether the president’s condition was improving or was “very concerning.” On Sunday, Mr. Trump’s medical team clarified that they had given an overly rosy description of the president’s illness on Saturday. But it remained unclear exactly when his illness had been diagnosed, when he had first developed symptoms, how severe those symptoms were and whether he had been treated with oxygen at any point. Here is a timeline of information released before Sunday on Mr. Trump’s health: Early Saturday, in the first official briefing by Mr. Trump’s doctors since he fell ill, the White House physician, Sean P. Conley, painted a relentlessly positive assessment of Mr. Trump’s condition. “The team and I are extremely happy with the progress the president has made,” Dr. Conley said then. His tone was a bit more guarded in the latest update. Dr. Conley said in a statement Saturday night that while the president is “not yet out of the woods, the team remains cautiously optimistic.” Dr. Conley and others on the team declined to provide important specifics, and left an impression that the president had been known to be sick a day earlier than previously reported, forcing them to backtrack later. At the morning briefing, Dr. Conley said that the president was not receiving supplemental oxygen at that time, but he repeatedly declined to say definitively whether Mr. Trump had ever been on oxygen. “None at this moment, and yesterday with the team, while we were all here, he was not on oxygen,” Dr. Conley said, leaving open whether there had been a period on Friday when he was on oxygen. Two people close to the White House said in separate interviews with The New York Times that the president had experienced trouble breathing on Friday and that his blood oxygen level had dropped, prompting his doctors to give him supplemental oxygen at the White House and then to transfer him to Walter Reed. Dr. Conley also appeared to indicate that the president’s infection was first diagnosed on Wednesday, and not on Thursday night, as Mr. Trump had said when he disclosed the positive test on Twitter early Friday. As Dr. Conley was describing what he said was the president’s progress, he said that Mr. Trump was “just 72 hours into the diagnosis now,” which would have put the diagnosis at midday on Wednesday. After the early briefing on Saturday, Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, offered a far more sobering assessment of the president’s condition than the doctors had. Speaking to reporters outside Walter Reed, Mr. Meadows described the president’s vital signs as “very concerning.” “We’re still not on a clear path to a full recovery,” he said. Mr. Meadows, whose comments were said to have angered the president, later called to Fox News and said that Mr. Trump had shown “unbelievable improvement.” Mr. Trump was said by three administration officials and people close to him to indeed be in better shape, which added to the frustration among some White House advisers that Dr. Conley and Mr. Meadows had created such confusion. — Peter Baker, Maggie Haberman and Marc Santora Kenzo Takada, the designer whose exuberant prints and volumes helped break the Paris barrier and bring Japanese fashion to the world, died on Sunday at a hospital in Paris. He was 81. The cause was complications from the novel coronavirus. A spokeswoman for Kenzo, the company he founded, confirmed the news. “Kenzo Takada was incredibly creative,” said Jonathan Bouchet Manheim, chief executive of K-3, the lifestyle company that Mr. Takada founded in January, though he had retired from fashion in 1999. “With a stroke of genius, he imagined a new artistic and colorful story combining East and West — his native Japan and his life in Paris. He had a zest for life …. Kenzo Takada was the epitome of the art of living.” Known for his beaming smile and mischievous sense of fun, Mr. Takada, who was generally referred to only as Kenzo, shook up the established French fashion world when he arrived — via boat — from Japan in 1964. Though he initially planned to stay only six months, he ended up living in the city for 56 years, and his work opened doors not only for the highly influential Japanese designers who came after him, such as Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo, but he also created a new kind of mix-and-match aesthetic that crossed borders and cultures, embraced diversity and influenced a generation. He died in the middle of Paris Fashion Week, which has been struggling to go on despite the pandemic. A smattering of live shows are taking place at a highly reduced capacity and with mask-wearing guests. The week began as Paris announced that the city is poised to, once again, shut down restaurants and bars if new cases continue to increase. — Vanessa Friedman Amid the muddled and conflicting information about President Trump’s condition, his allies seized on a video and photos the president posted online in an attempt to rally around a more consistent — and positive — message. After Mr. Trump posted the four-minute video Saturday evening on Twitter, his family and aides amplified the message that Mr. Trump was in good condition and working hard despite his illness. In the video, he wears a suit and describes feeling well — despite a warning from his own chief of staff that he did not yet face “a clear path to recovery.” “If only all elected officials had this work ethic,” his son Eric Trump wrote above photographs released by the White House appearing to show the president working from an office suite at Walter Reed hospital. He added that his father “is a true warrior. I have admired this unrelenting drive my entire life.” “One take, from the heart, no teleprompter,” Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump’s campaign, wrote in a tweet reposting Mr. Trump’s direct-to-camera video. “Over to you, Sleepy Joe!” he added, in a jab at Mr. Trump’s Democratic rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. (While there was no evidence of a teleprompter, Mr. Trump does look down at notes in front of him as he speaks.) And Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who also posted the video, said she had spoken to her father and that “he is as optimistic, thankful and strong as he looks and sounds in this message to America.” At the same time, however, Democratic and liberal critics of the president pounced on the video and images of the president as suspicious and potentially misleading. Some online sleuths noted that official photos of Mr. Trump appearing to sign documents in two different rooms, and wearing slightly different outfits, contained metadata with time stamps showing they were taken 10 minutes apart. The metadata later appeared to have been deleted. Others noted a moment in the video when Mr. Trump’s shoulders suddenly hunch and his face begins to contort midsentence as though he is about to cough before he returns to normal. Video experts said that modern editing tools can smooth out edits that would once have appeared abrupt and noticeable, though The New York Times was not able to verify the claims. The White House did not comment on whether the video had been edited. — Michael Crowley Two members of the White House residence staff tested positive for the coronavirus roughly three weeks ago, according to two people familiar with the diagnoses. The people who tested positive were not employees who come in direct contact with the president and the first lady, one of the people familiar with the diagnoses said. But the positive results again raise questions about how and when President Trump may have been exposed to the virus. Judd Deere, a spokesman for the president, declined to comment specifically on the diagnoses, referring to a statement about not commenting on the personal health of individuals. The White House “does take any positive case seriously and has extensive plans and procedures in place to prevent further spread,” he said. “A full and complete contact trace consistent with C.D.C. guidelines is included in that and appropriate notifications and recommendations are made. “ — Maggie Haberman Robert O’Brien, the national security adviser, said National Security Council staff members working at the White House complex must now wear face masks when around others or in common areas. “Over the past couple days as this spread through the West Wing, notwithstanding the bubble that was created here in the testing, we made mask wearing mandatory for National Security Council staff,” Mr. O’Brien told reporters at the White House on Sunday. He also said he planned to give Mr. Trump a national security briefing on Sunday afternoon, via secure video conference, along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley. Mr. Trump will receive the briefing in what Mr. O’Brien called a “secure facility” at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In a separate interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Mr. O’Brien said that Mr. Trump remained “firmly in control” of the country and that the United States remained “safe” despite the president’s illness. Asked whether he had discussed a potential transfer of power from the president to Vice President Mike Pence, Mr. O’Brien said that scenario was “not something that’s on the table at this point.” Last week, members of the National Security Council staff, who number just below 120, received an email instructing them to wear masks in common areas and in work spaces if they could not be socially distant from others. The email, reported earlier by CNN and confirmed by a White House official, also urged council aides, most of whom work in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next door to the White House, to avoid unnecessary visits to the West Wing. Mr. O’Brien, who contracted a mild case of the virus in July, said the council had imposed safety protocols early in the pandemic. — Michael Crowley GLOBAL ROUNDUP Saudi Arabia began lifting coronavirus restrictions at Islam’s holiest site in Mecca on Sunday, as a scattering of worshipers performed the umrah pilgrimage for the first time since March. A maximum of 6,000 pilgrims — a tiny fraction of the usual capacity — will now be allowed to enter the Grand Mosque in Mecca each day, the government said. On Oct. 18, the limit will be raised to 15,000 pilgrims a day. For now, only Saudi citizens and residents can worship at the mosque, but visitors from abroad may be allowed to do so starting Nov. 1, the government said. Video images showed socially distanced worshipers circling the black-clad Kaaba shrine at the center of the mosque on Sunday. Muslims wishing to worship must reserve a place in advance and are limited to three hours inside the mosque, which is being sanitized several times a day, the government said. As the pandemic took hold in the spring and countries closed their borders, the kingdom suspended the practice of the umrah pilgrimage, which can be performed at any time of year, and severely restricted the larger annual hajj pilgrimage, which Muslims are obliged to undertake once in life. Instead of the usual 2.5 million pilgrims from around the world, the kingdom reportedly allowed just 1,000 people from within its borders to perform the hajj, as it sought to contain an  outbreak that spread even within the royal family. As of Sunday, Saudi Arabia has reported a total of 335,997 cases and 4,850 deaths. In other global developments: With President Trump  hospitalized with Covid-19, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will cut short a trip to Asia this week, canceling stops in South Korea and Mongolia but continuing with a visit to Japan. Mr. Pompeo earlier alluded to the possibility of curtailing his Asia visit because of the infections in the president’s circle, but a State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, did not specify why the schedule had been changed in a statement on Saturday. The United Kingdom reported a record 12,871 new cases on Saturday evening, double the number daily infections from Friday. The nation is working to contain a second wave, and the government said the spike was the result of a “technical issue” that delayed the publication of some cases. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday that the situation would be “bumpy” until Christmas and potentially longer. He urged Britons to behave “fearlessly, but with common sense.” Two prominent Israeli officials said on Twitter that they had tested positive for the virus: Gila Gamliel, the environmental protection minister, and Ayman Odeh, a prominent Arab lawmaker posted. France reported some 17,000 new cases of infection on Saturday as an surge in cases forced the closure of bars and restaurants in the southern port of Marseilles. Rising infection rates mean similar closures could soon apply in the capital, Paris. Poland’s government said the country surpassed 100,000 total cases on Sunday for the first time. Russia on Sunday recorded more than 10,000 new infections for the first time since mid-May,  reporting 10,499 cases. President Vladimir V. Putin, who encouraged his country to return to normal, has built himself a virus-free bubble that far outstrips the protective measures taken by many of his foreign counterparts. India on Sunday reported 75,829 new infections and 940 deaths, a day after it became the third country after the United States and Brazil to pass 100,000 deaths. — Isabella Kwai Pope Francis criticized the failures of global cooperation in response to the coronavirus pandemic in a document released on Sunday that underscores the priorities of his pontificate. “As I was writing this letter, the Covid-19 pandemic unexpectedly erupted, exposing our false securities,” Francis said in the encyclical, the most authoritative form of papal teaching. “Aside from the different ways that various countries responded to the crisis, their inability to work together became quite evident. For all our hyper-connectivity, we witnessed a fragmentation that made it more difficult to resolve problems that affect us all,” he added. “Anyone who thinks that the only lesson to be learned was the need to improve what we were already doing, or to refine existing systems and regulations, is denying reality,” the pope said. Released amid another Vatican financial scandal and after changes in church rules regarding sex abuse, the letter steered clear of other contentious subjects. It instead returned often to some of the church’s hobbyhorses, including a secularism that has produced what the church sees as a throwaway, consumerist culture. Francis argued that this was apparent in the treatment of older people during the pandemic. “If only we might keep in mind all those elderly persons who died for lack of respirators, partly as a result of the dismantling, year after year, of health care systems. If only this immense sorrow may not prove useless, but enable us to take a step forward toward a new style of life,” he wrote. The pope also warned that the forces of “myopic, extremist, resentful and aggressive nationalism are on the rise.” — Jason Horowitz On Sunday, more than 40,000 people were expected to run the London Marathon — just not together. Instead, runners were scattered across Britain and more than 100 other countries, after organizers encouraged the vast majority of participants to run 26.2 miles at a time that worked for them wherever they happened to be. Those who took part in the geographically distanced race were told to log their performances on a dedicated app to claim their medals and official T-shirts. The official course in St. James’s Park in central London — 19 laps of 1.3 miles each, plus an additional 1,470 yards  — was restricted to a relative handful of elite runners. The race, which was postponed from April, is one of the only major marathons to be maintained in any form this year. Brigid Kosgei of Kenya, who won the 2019 edition and is the current world-record holder in the women’s marathon, defended her title on Sunday, finishing in 2 hours 18 minutes 58 seconds. Kosgei, 26, told the BBC that while it was “wonderful to race,” her preparation had been affected by the pandemic. “I struggled up to the moment I finished,” she said. In the men’s race, the Ethiopian runner Shura Kitata, 24, won in a sprint finish, crossing the line in 2:05.41, a second before Vincent Kipchumba of Kenya. World-record holder Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya, who has won the London Marathon four times, came in eighth. Prince Harry said Saturday in a message published by the race’s organizers that “the amazing tenacity of runners from around the world is a reminder of our strength and sense of community during these difficult times.” — Elian Peltier As President Trump remains hospitalized with Covid-19, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will cut short a trip to Asia this week, canceling stops in South Korea and Mongolia but continuing with a visit to Japan. From Sunday through Tuesday he will be in Tokyo, where he will participate in a meeting of foreign ministers from Australia, India and Japan to discuss the pandemic and other issues. “Secretary Pompeo expects to be traveling to Asia again in October and will work to reschedule visits on that trip, that is now just a few weeks off,” a State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said in a brief written statement Saturday. She did not specify why the schedule had been changed. Mr. Pompeo earlier alluded to the possibility of curtailing his Asia visit because of the novel coronavirus infections in the president’s circle. “If we can’t — if have to postpone a trip or cancel something, we’ll figure out how to get it back on the schedule,” he told reporters on Friday. “But I’m hopeful we can at least make sure we get to Asia for sure — some important things, but we’ll see. If the medical situation doesn’t permit it, we won’t do that. We won’t put anybody at risk.” Mr. Pompeo said that he had tested negative on Friday and had last met with Mr. Trump on Sept. 15. — Austin Ramzy After surviving some of the bloodiest combat in Afghanistan, the men of the Second Battalion, Seventh Marine Regiment stayed connected on social media for support at home as they grappled with the fallout of war. Those close online connections offered something the veterans’ health care system did not: common ground, understanding, friends ready to talk day or night. But those connections have been frayed to breaking by the partisan rancor of 2020. The Facebook group the men once relied on for support is now clogged with divisive memes and partisan conspiracy theories, disputes over policing and protests, and, of course, strong views on the president. The din has driven a growing number of members to log off in dismay. Many say they still want to support their fellow Marines but cannot stand the toxic political traffic. “It hurts my soul to see all this childish drama,” said Keith Branch, a former infantryman of the Second Battalion, Seventh Marine Regiment. “Brothers that formed bonds in war, I see them becoming broken over childish arguments. I disconnect from it — I’m already dealing with post-traumatic stress. It hurts too much to look at it.” Party strategists and analysts tend to treat veterans as a homogeneous voting bloc, conservative-leaning and focused mainly on defense and benefits issues. In 2016, exit polls showed that veterans backed Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton by nearly two to one.
