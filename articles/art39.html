Barr briefed Trump on a mail-in ballot inquiry, prompting fears of Justice Dept. politicization. Concerns grow at the Pentagon that Trump will pull the military into the election. Legal battles over voting rules may be a preview of postelection fights. Why the Supreme Court fight is a tightrope for Trump and the G.O.P. A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from ending the census early. A complete guide to how to vote, by mail or in person, early or on Election Day. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg becomes the first woman to lie in state in the Capitol, breaking one last barrier. For 38 million Americans with disabilities, voting is even harder than usual this year. Matt Lieberman faces calls to quit Georgia Senate race as Obama endorses Warnock. Attorney General William P. Barr briefed President Trump this week on the details of an ongoing Justice Department voter fraud investigation, according to a department official, a highly unusual move that raised new questions about any role the department has in Mr. Trump’s re-election bid. Mr. Barr told the president that federal investigators in Pennsylvania were examining whether local elections officials had discarded nine mail-in votes, at least seven of which that were cast for Mr. Trump, the official said. After he was briefed, Mr. Trump publicly referenced the discarded ballots in a radio interview on Thursday, prompting questions from reporters and a Justice Department disclosure of details about the investigation, another rare step. The Justice Department typically only discusses ongoing investigations with the president that involve national security and rarely releases details about an inquiry before it has been completed. The disclosures helped feed the misleading narrative by the president and the attorney general that mail-in voting is rife with fraud. Around the time the Justice Department released the details on Thursday, White House and Trump campaign aides pointed to the case as an example of how mail-in voting was undermining the fairness of the election. The same week the nation’s top officials discussed the fate of the nine ballots, the director of the F.B.I., Christopher A. Wray, testified to Congress that the bureau had not seen evidence of a “coordinated national voter fraud effort.” Any fraud effort would have to be widespread and well coordinated to change the election outcome, and carrying out that kind of fraud would be a “major challenge for an adversary,” Mr. Wray said. The Justice Department said on Thursday that the U.S. attorney for central Pennsylvania, David J. Freed, had opened the investigation and that the F.B.I. had been examining the mail-in ballots from military members in Luzerne County in northeastern Pennsylvania that had been “discarded.” Mr. Freed said that out of the nine ballots that had been examined, seven were cast for Mr. Trump. ABC News earlier reported that the attorney general briefed the president. — Michael S. Schmidt and Katie Benner With President Trump’s refusal to commit to a peaceful transition of power if he loses in November shaking up the presidential campaign, his chief of staff belittled the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Friday for telling Congress that there was no evidence of the kind of widespread voter fraud the president has repeatedly warned of. After the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, testified to Congress on Thursday that the bureau had seen no evidence of coordinated fraud, undercutting Mr. Trump’s constant, baseless claims that the election would not be “honest” or that mail-in ballots were a “scam,” the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, struck back Friday on “CBS This Morning.” “With all due respect to Director Wray, he has a hard time finding emails in his own F.B.I., let alone figuring out whether there’s any kind of voter fraud,” Mr. Meadows said, possibly referring to anti-Trump texts between F.B.I. officials on the team of the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, which the F.B.I. has said were not preserved, angering Republicans. The extraordinary scene of the White House chief of staff denigrating one of the nation’s top law enforcement officials was the latest sign of how the president’s refusal to commit to honoring the results of the presidential election has rattled Washington. On Thursday, prominent Republicans reaffirmed their commitment to the orderly transfer of power, but took pains to avoid criticizing the president. Democrats cast Mr. Trump as a threat to democracy who sought to undermine confidence in the election and suppress the vote. And the White House attempted to send reassuring signals, only for Mr. Trump, who has trailed steadily in polls, to double down and repeat baseless assertions that the vote would be a “big scam.” Chris Edelson, an American University professor who has studied the expansion of presidential power during emergencies, said there were “really no precedents” for Mr. Trump’s comments. “It’s impossible to underscore how absolutely extraordinary this situation is,” he said. “This is a president who has threatened to jail his political opponents. Now he is suggesting he would not respect the results of an election. These are serious warning signs.” The Justice Department raised eyebrows by releasing details of an investigation into nine discarded mailed-in ballots in Pennsylvania, seven of which had been cast for Mr. Trump — an unusual step that stoked new fears that Mr. Trump’s political appointees were using the levers of law enforcement to sow doubt about the election. Mr. Trump was personally briefed on the nine ballots by Attorney General William P. Barr, before the Justice Department announced the investigation, a Justice Department official confirmed. The briefing was first reported by ABC News. Election experts said the announcement of the investigation was highly irregular. Justice Department policy calls for keeping voter fraud investigations under wraps to avoid affecting election results, and the experts said it was almost unheard-of for the department to disclose the name of a candidate for whom ballots had been cast. Asked about Mr. Trump’s reluctance to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, Mr. Meadows said the president would do so “as long as it’s a fair election,” echoing comments made Thursday by the White House press secretary. — Michael Cooper, Katie Benner and Michael Crowley Senior Pentagon leaders have a lot to worry about these days — Afghanistan, Russia, Iraq, Syria, Iran, China, Somalia, the Korean Peninsula. But chief among those concerns is whether their commander in chief might order American troops into any chaos around the coming elections. President Trump gave the officials no solace this week as he hedged when asked to commit to a peaceful handoff of the reins of government should he lose the election. Coupled with his expressed desire in June to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act to send troops to quell Black Lives Matter protests, his comments have incited deep anxiety among senior military leaders, who insist they will do all they can to keep the armed forces out of the elections. “I believe deeply in the principle of an apolitical U.S. military,” Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told House lawmakers last month. “In the event of a dispute over some aspect of the elections, by law, U.S. courts and the U.S. Congress are required to resolve any disputes, not the U.S. military. I foresee no role for the U.S. armed forces in this process.” But that has not stopped an intensifying debate in the military about its role should a disputed election lead to civil unrest. Last month, two retired Army officers published an open letter to General Milley on the website Defense One. “In a few months’ time, you may have to choose between defying a lawless president or betraying your constitutional oath,” they wrote. “If Donald Trump refuses to leave office at the expiration of his constitutional term, the United States military must remove him by force, and you must give that order.” Pentagon officials swiftly said such an outcome was preposterous. But senior leaders at the Pentagon, speaking on the condition of anonymity, acknowledged that they were talking among themselves about what to do if Mr. Trump, who will still be president until Inauguration Day no matter what, invokes the Insurrection Act and tries to send troops into the streets. Several Pentagon officials said that such a move could prompt resignations among many of Mr. Trump’s senior generals, starting at the top with General Milley.  — Jennifer Steinhauer and Helene Cooper With less than six weeks until Election Day, laws governing how Americans vote remain in flux in many battleground states, with the two parties fighting over rules and President Trump suggesting he might challenge any unfavorable outcome. The combination of the pandemic and doubts about the capacity of the Postal Service to handle the flood of mail ballots it will bring, along with a push by Democrats to expand access to voting and counter Republican efforts to limit it, has fueled lawsuits and legislative skirmishes that remain unresolved even with early voting underway. The result is uncertainty that Mr. Trump seized on this week to cast doubt on the election,  refusing on Wednesday to commit to a peaceful transfer of power and saying on Thursday that he was not sure the November election could be “honest” because mail-in ballots were “a whole big scam.” In many states, confusion over casting and counting ballots has reached levels rarely before seen. In Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, two pivotal states in the presidential election, legal fights could affect when voters have to mail their ballots. In Pennsylvania and Ohio, there are lawsuits about where voters can drop ballots off. In Michigan, another battleground, pending legislation concerns whether voters will be able to fix problems with mail-in ballots. In North Carolina, after elections officials extended the deadline for receiving mail ballots by six days, Republicans pledged to try to overturn it. “A whole bunch of Americans are going to have a different process than they may be used to,” said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School who oversaw voting rights in the Obama administration as a deputy assistant attorney general.  — Nick Corasaniti and Kenneth P. Vogel BANGKOK — Amid the pandemic and in the run-up to the presidential election, much of the world is watching the United States with a mix of shock, chagrin and, most of all, bafflement. How did a superpower allow itself to be felled by a virus? And after nearly four years during which President Trump has praised authoritarian leaders and obscenely dismissed some other countries as insignificant and crime-ridden, is the United States in danger of exhibiting some of the same traits he has disparaged? “The U.S.A. is a first-world country but it is acting like a third-world country,” said U Aung Thu Nyein, a political analyst in Myanmar. Adding to the sense of bewilderment, Mr. Trump has refused to embrace an indispensable principle of democracy, dodging questions about whether he will commit to a peaceful transition of power after the November election should he lose. His demurral, combined with his frequent attacks on the balloting process, led Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, a Republican, to write on Twitter that the peaceful transition of power is fundamental to democracy. “Without that, there is Belarus,” he wrote. In Belarus, where tens of thousands of people have faced down the police after the widely disputed re-election last month of President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, Mr. Trump’s remarks sounded familiar. “It reminds me of Belarus, when a person cannot admit defeat and looks for any means to prove that he couldn’t lose,” said Kiryl Kalbasnikau, a 29-year-old opposition activist and actor. “This would be a warning sign for any democracy.” The diminution of the United States’ global image began before the pandemic, as Trump administration officials snubbed international accords and embraced an America First policy. Now, though, its reputation seems to be in free-fall. A Pew Research Center poll of 13 countries found that over the past year, nations including Canada, Japan, Australia and Germany have been viewing the United States in its most negative light in years. In every country surveyed, the vast majority of respondents thought the United States was doing a bad job with the pandemic. Such global disapproval historically has applied to countries with less open political systems and strongmen in charge. But people from just the kind of developing countries that Mr. Trump has mocked say the signs coming from the United States are ominous: a disease unchecked, mass protests over racial and social inequality, and a president who seems unwilling to pledge support for the tenets of electoral democracy. And an American passport, which once allowed easy access to almost every country in the world, is no longer a valuable travel pass. Because of the coronavirus, American tourists are banned from most of Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania and Latin America.  — Hannah Beech As President Trump prepares to reveal his Supreme Court nominee on Saturday, and Senate Republicans move to hold lightning-quick confirmation hearings ahead of the election, they are making risky calculations aimed at navigating difficult political straits with less than 40 days left in the campaign. In order to achieve a new 6-3 conservative majority on the court, Republicans are poised to defy a clear majority of voters who have indicated in polls that they want the winner of the election to pick a nominee for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat. They are even willing to energize Democratic turnout in the short run by elevating issues like abortion, if it means achieving the long-term goal of tilting the court further to the right. That gamble would almost certainly play out if Mr. Trump nominates Judge Amy Coney Barrett, the leading contender and a favorite of social conservatives. The political consequences would be less clear if he chose the preferred candidate of some of his advisers: Judge Barbara Lagoa, a Latina whose elevation might help him carry the must-win state of Florida. The president appears intent on picking Judge Barrett, though, according to Republicans familiar with his conversations. And his advisers and party lawmakers are placing wagers on a Barrett pick that are based on hope as much as strategy, as Mr. Trump trails in battleground states and the Senate G.O.P. majority appears increasingly precarious. They believe a partisan fight over the court offers them at least a chance to steer the debate away from political danger zones like the president’s handling of a virus that has claimed over 200,000 American lives, and his unceasing rhetorical eruptions, most recently his indication that he would be unwilling to agree to a peaceful transition of power. “Either the election can be about Trump or about Covid or about the Supreme Court,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, the long-serving Tennessee Republican who is retiring next year. “And I think, of those three, if it’s about the Supreme Court, that traditionally has helped Republicans more.” — Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman President Trump has initiated the most aggressive environmental deregulation agenda in modern history, but as his first term drives to a close, many of his policies are being cut down by the courts — even by Republican-appointed jurists who the administration had hoped would be friendly. Those losses have actually heightened the stakes for Mr. Trump in the election and the fight over a replacement on the Supreme Court for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: A second term, coupled with a 6-3 conservative majority on the high court, may be necessary to make some of his biggest environmental rollbacks a reality. Since January courts have dealt a series of blows to the Trump administration’s plans to ramp up fossil fuel development and undo decades of environmental protections. This month, a federal appeals court temporarily blocked implementation of a major rollback of methane emissions standards for the oil and gas industry while it considers permanent action. That followed decisions by judges that have thrown the future of the Dakota Access Pipeline into doubt, struck down the relaxation of protections for migratory birds and vacated the rollback of an Obama-era rule to reduce waste from natural gas flaring on federal lands. Five recent unfavorable rulings came from Republican-appointed judges, including a 6-3 clean water decision in April by the Supreme Court with Justice Ginsburg in the majority. A panel of three judges appointed by Mr. Trump unanimously overturned a policy that would have suspended hefty new penalties for automakers who failed to meet fuel efficiency standards. According to a database kept by New York University’s nonpartisan Institute for Policy Integrity, the Environmental Protection Agency has won only nine out of 47 cases in court under Mr. Trump, while the Interior Department has won four of 22. The Trump administration’s overall win rate hovers just under 16 percent, the group said, compared to win rates of about 70 percent for both the Obama and Bush administrations. But the courts have in most cases given the administration an opportunity to go back and revise their work. The future of those rules may then rest on whether Mr. Trump is re-elected, with a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court ready to hear his fresh attempts.  — Lisa Friedman and John Schwartz A federal judge barred the Trump administration on Friday from ending the 2020 census a month early, the latest twist in years of political and legal warfare over perhaps the most contested population count in a century. In U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Judge Lucy H. Koh issued a preliminary injunction preventing the administration from winding down the count by Sept. 30, a month before the scheduled completion date of Oct. 31. She also barred officials from delivering completed population data to the White House on Dec. 31 rather than the April 2021 delivery date that had previously been set out. The judge had temporarily stayed the early completion of the census count on Sept. 5 pending a hearing held on Tuesday. The ruling came after evidence filed this week showed that top Census Bureau officials believed ending the head count early would seriously endanger its accuracy. In one July email, the head of census field operations, Timothy P. Olson Jr., called it “ludicrous” to think a curtailed population count would succeed. A second internal document drafted in late July said a shortened census would have “fatal data flaws that are unacceptable for a constitutionally mandated national activity.” The administration ordered the speedup anyway. Critics immediately said it would lead to drastic undercounts, particularly for low-income areas and communities of color, which are least likely to respond to the census. The Trump administration had argued that it needed to end census-taking early to begin processing state-by-state population data or it would miss a statutory Dec. 31 deadline for sending population figures to President Trump. That was widely seen as an effort to ensure that Mr. Trump — and not Joseph R. Biden Jr., should he win the presidential election — controls census figures that will be used next year to reallocate seats in the House of Representatives and draw thousands of political boundaries nationwide.  — Michael Wines Many voting rules have changed this year because of the pandemic, making it harder than usual to figure out how to cast your ballot.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg broke one final barrier on Friday, becoming the first woman and the first Jewish American to lie in state in the United States Capitol. The honor, arranged by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and a private ceremony at the Capitol, bring to a close a week of public memorials for Justice Ginsburg, the liberal Supreme Court jurist and trailblazer who died last Friday at 87. Her family plans to hold a private burial next week at Arlington National Cemetery. Like the memorial at the court on Wednesday, the honors Friday at the Capitol were brief and mostly limited to family and a small contingent of lawmakers. Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill Biden, attended Friday’s the ceremony, along with Senator Kamala Harris, Mr. Biden’s running mate. Asked by a reporter if Justice Ginsburg had helped clear a path for her own success, Ms. Harris said “absolutely.” Justice Ginsburg “made America see what leadership looks like,” Ms. Harris said. “She broke so many barriers and I know that she did it intentionally knowing that people like me could follow.” Only about 30 Americans have received the honor of lying in state at the Capitol: presidents, military leaders and members of Congress, all of them men. Rosa Parks, the civil rights icon, is the only other woman granted a similar honor, but as a private citizen, she lay “in honor.” Justice Ginsburg lay in state in the National Statuary Hall on the House side of the Capitol, where Democrats are in control. Many dignitaries have lain in state in the Capitol Rotunda, between the House and Senate, but both chambers must agree and pass special legislation to allow that. On Thursday, President Trump was jeered by protesters as he paid his respects to Justice Ginsburg, standing silently by her coffin at the top of the Supreme Court steps as a vigorous chant of “Vote him out!” erupted on the street below. As Justice Ginsburg’s legacy was celebrated at the Capitol, White House officials and Senate Republicans busied themselves on Friday with preparations of their own to usher in a conservative successor to the Supreme Court with remarkable speed. — Nicholas Fandos According to new projections from researchers at Rutgers University, nearly one in six American voters is disabled. For those 38 million people, the coronavirus pandemic has enormously complicated what was already a frustratingly difficult process: casting a vote. Most accessibility discussions this year have centered on expanding mail-in voting, and that does make a difference. The Rutgers researchers found higher turnout among people with disabilities when states allowed no-excuse absentee voting. But mail-in voting alone won’t allow everyone with a disability to vote. Joanne Wolf, 64, of Cincinnati, missed an election for the first time she could remember because she couldn’t find an accessible way to vote in this year’s primary. She has multiple sclerosis and didn’t feel safe voting in person. But she can’t write by hand or sign an absentee ballot; when she completed one several years ago using a signature stamp, it was rejected. In Maryland, Sheryl Grossman, who has an illness that weakens her immune system and causes cognitive disabilities, voted in a primary this year by taping a blank mail-in ballot to her door, alongside a list of her choices. As she watched through her window, two election officials filled out the ballot, texted her a photo and sealed the envelope. “It was not an independent, private ballot,” she said. “But if that was not an option, I would not have been able to cast a ballot at all.” The obstacles created by the coronavirus are piling on top of the ones voters with disabilities already face, including polling sites that, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, are inaccessible to people who use wheelchairs. Barriers don’t stop at the door. Polling sites are required to have accessible voting machines — for instance, ones that can read text aloud for people with visual disabilities — but some voters recalled showing up for past elections and being told that the only accessible machine was broken, or that poll workers didn’t know how to operate it. “Democracy only works if everyone is able to participate and vote,” said Lisa Schur, one of the Rutgers researchers. “And to the extent people with disabilities are excluded from the process, then we really have a failed system.” — Maggie Astor Democrats aren’t being very subtle about their feelings toward Matt Lieberman, a Democratic candidate for one of Georgia’s two Senate seats on the ballot in November. The son of Joseph I. Lieberman, the former Connecticut senator and 2000 Democratic nominee for vice president, is resisting calls from just about everyone that he withdraw in deference to the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor of Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church and a fellow Democrat, who leads him in the polls. On Friday, former President Barack Obama endorsed Dr. Warnock, making a rare foray into what is essentially a party primary. His backing comes a day after Stacey Abrams, the de facto head of Georgia Democrats, said, “We need Matt Lieberman to understand he’s not called for this moment.” And The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Thursday quoted Democrats from across the political spectrum urging Mr. Lieberman to quit. The reason Democrats want Mr. Lieberman out is that he is not competing in a traditional party primary. Because Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican, was appointed in December to replace Senator Johnny Isakson, the first round of voting for the final two years of her term is an all-party primary, with 21 names on the Nov. 3 ballot. If no one gets more than 50 percent of the vote — a near certainty with so many candidates — the top two finishers will compete in a January runoff election. Three polls released this week, by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Monmouth University and The New York Times, showed Ms. Loeffler, Representative Doug Collins, a Republican, and Dr. Warnock bunched tightly together, with Mr. Lieberman trailing the pack, but corralling enough support that it is a distinct possibility that Democrats could be locked out of the January runoff. This week is not the first time Georgia Democrats have called for Mr. Lieberman to quit the race. In August, after HuffPost reported that a novel Mr. Lieberman self-published in 2018 included a racist character and tropes, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Georgia asked him to step aside. Mr. Lieberman’s presence on the ticket has also exposed Dr. Warnock’s inability, so far, to build his coalition beyond the roughly 20 percent support he has received in the latest polling. Mr. Lieberman on Thursday tweeted a lengthy defense of his candidacy that argued Dr. Warnock, and the leading Republican candidates, would all be tools of political elites. In an interview Friday, Mr. Lieberman contended there was “almost no chance” of Democrats being locked out of the runoff because of his candidacy. “If I end up running even or stronger to Warnock its probably because something has befallen his campaign that they have not been able to handle, or because my campaign has made headway,” Mr. Lieberman said. “This tremendous fear that everyone has been living under has been hyped up and is the direct consequence of fear-mongering from the party bosses.” He struck a similar tone on Twitter later on Friday. “Congrats on endorsement from 44 who has endorsed every DC-approved senate candidate,” he told Dr. Warnock. “No, you won’t be beholden to the bosses at all….” Dr. Warnock has a decided financial advantage over Mr. Lieberman. The Warnock campaign has spent $7.9 million on television advertising, compared to just $134,000 for Mr. Lieberman, according to Advertising Analytics. But the Republicans running also have a vast disparity in TV spending while Ms. Loeffler ($16.6 million) and Mr. Collins ($1.2 million) remain neck-and-neck in the polls. — Reid J. Epstein AD WATCH Is it a trailer for an action movie? A Hollywood thriller? At first glance, the four-minute clip resembles an ad for a big-budget film, featuring the dramatic music and special effects — sky-diving! some sort of scanning technology emitted from a character’s eye! — that typically herald a highly-anticipated movie release. It is  in fact a destined-for-virality six-candidate campaign ad, released on Thursday by Texas Reloaded, a joint fund-raising Republican committee for House races in Texas. It’s 5 a.m. in the “Crenshaw Command Center,” and Representative Dan Crenshaw of Houston, a former Navy SEAL, tears open an envelope marked “TOP SECRET.” Inside is a phone. Mr. Crenshaw, who wears an eye patch because of an injury he suffered in Afghanistan, lifts his patch and emits a laser to decipher the phone’s instructions. “Your mission, should you choose to accept it, will be to save Texas,” says a woman’s vaguely robotic, vaguely British voice. “To do so, you must recruit an exceptional team of congressional candidates. They must be courageous, patriotic and absolutely fearless. Time is of the essence. The nation’s future is dependent on your success.” Mr. Crenshaw, now in a plane, leaps into the sky as his first “target” appears: Wesley Hunt, a Republican candidate in a district next door and West Point graduate, whom Mr. Crenshaw finds in the cockpit of a helicopter. “I’m putting a team together, Wesley, you in?” Mr. Crenshaw asks. The two men form a trio with August Pfluger, who is running in the west-central 11th District, and recruit three others: Beth Van Duyne, a former mayor who is running in the Dallas suburbs; Tony Gonzales, a Navy veteran running in a district along the Mexican border; and Genevieve Collins, also running in a suburban-Dallas district, whose credentials flashed onscreen include “athlete.” “TEAM ASSEMBLED. AWAITING NEXT OBJECTIVE” scrolls across the screen. A final shot of the candidates walking together as a fiery explosion erupts behind them closes out the ad. The ad is unequivocally intended to energize Republicans in Texas. Though the ad is somewhat hyperbolic — the nation’s future might not literally depend on Mr. Crenshaw’s ability to recruit Republican congressional candidates — the urgency it suggests is not off base. Texas this year features a number of competitive House races, and Democrats are optimistic that the state could eventually flip from red to blue. Of the six races referenced in the ad, five, including Mr. Crenshaw’s, are ranked by the Cook Political Report as competitive. “We are relying almost exclusively on organic reach on social media,” said Justin Discigil, a spokesman for the Crenshaw campaign. “We have no plans to put the ad on TV.” The ad seems to address head-on that fact Texas is not as red as it once was. Several of the Democratic candidates in these districts, including Sima Ladjevardian, a lawyer and progressive activist who is challenging Mr. Crenshaw, are thought to have decent shots at winning. Mr. Discigil said in an email that Texas Reloaded has raised more than $215,000 since the ad came out. Asked how much the ad cost to make, he said only, “The ad has already paid for itself many times over.” — Sydney Ember DAILY SCHEDULES Here are the daily schedules of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates for Friday, Sept. 25. All times are Eastern time. President Trump 11 a.m.: Speaks at a Latinos for Trump event in Doral, Fla. 2:40 p.m.: Speaks about Black economic empowerment in Atlanta. 6:45 p.m.: Speaks at a round table with supporters at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. 9 p.m.: Holds a rally in Newport News, Va. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Morning: Attends a memorial service for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the Capitol. Vice President Mike Pence No events scheduled. Senator Kamala Harris Morning: Attends a memorial service for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the Capitol. Afternoon: Speaks at a virtual convention of the N.A.A.C.P. If Arizona flips from red to blue this year — and according to most polls, that appears highly possible — it would be a historical outlier: The state has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1952, except one. But it probably wouldn’t be a blip. Arizona has been trending blue for years, driven by its increasingly ethnically diverse electorate and growing Democratic strength among suburban voters. “The state’s clearly in motion,” Paul Maslin, a veteran Democratic pollster, said in an interview. A victory there for Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Maslin added, “would be a furthering of those trends: the Latino vote locking in for Democrats, but also a suburban vote — around Phoenix and Tucson — moving Democratic.” When Donald J. Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Arizona in 2016, he captured only 48 percent of the vote — less than any winning candidate in the state since Bill Clinton squeaked by with a rare Democratic victory in 1996. Today, with most Arizona voters telling pollsters that they disapprove of how Mr. Trump has handled the pandemic, surveys consistently show Mr. Biden with the advantage. And in the race for the Senate seat once held by John McCain, the Democratic challenger, Mark Kelly — a retired NASA astronaut and the husband of former Representative Gabrielle Giffords — leads the Republican incumbent, Senator Martha McSally, among likely voters by anywhere from one percentage point, in a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, to eight points, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll out this week. — Giovanni Russonello A crucial stretch of the race is about to start as President Trump’s Supreme Court pick and his first debate with Joe Biden loom.
