White House says aid to states and cities is the biggest stimulus sticking point. Cuomo will ease restrictions in some N.Y.C. virus hot spots. A court rules that a California prison ravaged by the virus must transfer inmates to protect them. Big Ten’s football debut raises concerns for local mayors. Thailand welcomes its first foreign tourists in months, and other news from around the world. Worried about the virus in the winter? Alaska offers a cautionary tale. In the past seven days, seven countries — Argentina, Brazil, Britain, France, India, Russia and the United States — have reported at least 100,000 new cases of the coronavirus, helping to push total cases worldwide to more than 40.7 million, according to a New York Times database. In many cases, these countries are seeing numbers that are much higher than they were during the height of the pandemic in the spring. At that point most countries locked down, stopping movement and much interpersonal contact. Strategies have changed, and today local lockdowns are the way forward for most. There is more testing, giving a clearer picture of the pandemic. But the numbers continue to grow. Over the past week in the United States, there have been 421,114 new cases, illustrating that the long-predicted fall wave of the virus is well underway.  Midwestern and Rocky Mountain states are struggling to control major outbreaks. And the national trajectory is worsening by the day, as the cooler weather drives more people to stay indoors where the virus spreads easily. In some states, hospitals are almost full. India reported 411,718 over the past seven days, but numbers have been falling since mid-September. On Monday, the country recorded fewer than 50,000 cases, the lowest number since July, the government said. But the lower numbers, which would seem at first glance to be good news, have raised questions. The government recently approved the use of rapid coronavirus testing based on gene-editing technology, hoping to increase its testing capabilities. But experts question the reliability of rapid tests. In France, which has added 174,273 cases in the past seven days, a curfew has been implemented in Paris and eight other regions. Still, more than 11,000 virus patients are hospitalized, and 2,000 are in intensive care, a threshold that had not been reached since May. (The country currently has 5,800 intensive care beds.) Brazil, which has reported 160,326 cases in the past seven days, is among the countries with the lowest testing rates and still lacks a clear contact tracing policy. Despite being the country with the second-highest death toll, about eight million Brazilians had received laboratory tests by mid-October, according to the Ministry of Health, less than a tenth of the number of people tested in the United States. But, as in India, the disease has been trending downward in Brazil since early August. The country is now reporting an average of 500 deaths a day, half of the daily toll it reported two months ago. Most big cities have eased  social-distancing measures and opened some schools, restaurants, and beaches. The number of daily recorded infections in Britain, which includes England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, has nearly tripled since the beginning of October. In the past seven days, Britain has reported 127,622 new cases. Hospitalizations and deaths are also rising, and in some parts of the country, intensive care units are being stretched to their limits. The countries that make up Britain are each forging their own paths: England has implemented a tiered alert system; Northern Ireland is ramping up restrictions for pubs and restaurants, and closing schools; Scotland implemented a two-week tightening of restrictions; and Wales was preparing to enter a two-week national lockdown. Russia has added 103,992 new cases in the past seven days.. The government, however, has resisted imposing even local lockdowns, although it has started to enforce mask-wearing requirements The capital, Moscow, is recording about one-third of the country’s daily new cases. Health authorities there have opened temporary hospitals in a city park and in a large car-dealership center.  But Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said curfews and business closings are “absolutely unacceptable and impossible for us.” Argentina has reported 101,964 cases in the past seven days. It is the fifth country to surpass one million total cases.  The country received praise early in the pandemic for imposing a strict quarantine in mid-March, and although certain restrictions have been relaxed, much of the country is still under some type of lockdown order. Still, the virus, which was once concentrated in the Buenos Aires area, has since expanded to much of the country, including remote areas with scarce medical resources. — Kaly Soto, Eileen Sullivan, Sameer Yasir, Antonella Francini, Manuela Andreoni, Anna Schaverien, Anton Troianovski and Daniel Politi Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, said on Wednesday that a call by Democrats for hundreds of billions of dollars in federal aid for states and cities and their resistance to a liability shield for businesses remained the toughest obstacles to a stimulus deal. “The biggest issue remains state and local assistance,” Mr. Meadows said on the Fox Business Network. “That remains a stumbling block.” His remarks came hours before Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were scheduled to continue talks on a broad pandemic relief package in hopes of reaching a deal this week, even as congressional Republicans fought to prevent such a compromise from materializing before Election Day. Mr. Mnuchin, who is returning from a trip to the Middle East, and Ms. Pelosi planned to speak later on Wednesday. The two sides have been trying to reach an agreement on another round of economic aid that could be enacted before Nov. 3. But Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has told the White House to abandon its efforts, concerned about the political fallout for Republicans. Mr. Meadows suggested that progress was being made, but said he feared that politics could get in the way. Ms. Pelosi on Tuesday signaled that Democrats were preparing counteroffers on both liability protections for businesses that are seeking to reopen and state and local funding. The White House has proposed providing $250 billion to states and municipalities, Mr. Meadows said, while House Democrats have called for double that. He also said that the liability protections were a crucial priority for Republicans, and he chided Ms. Pelosi for resisting them, saying she was being “disingenuous” if she believed that his party would agree to any deal without them. Even as Republicans resisted a compromise, pressure was mounting from rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties to reach one. A bipartisan group of House lawmakers on Wednesday wrote to congressional leaders and Mr. Trump urging a resolution before the November elections. “We know there may be remaining issues to be resolved between the negotiators, but it appears those issues are certainly solvable,” the group, known as the Problem Solvers Caucus, wrote. “Our families, businesses, and local communities don’t have the luxury of time so Washington can continue its partisan games. We must do our job and do it now.” Across the Capitol, in an effort to put pressure on Democrats, who have largely resisted narrow aid packages, Senate Republicans planned to try to advance a targeted $500 billion plan that would revive lapsed federal unemployment benefits and a popular federal loan program for small businesses, as well as provide additional money for testing. It was expected to be opposed by most Democrats, who have argued it falls far short of the level of aid needed, and fail to clear the 60-vote threshold required to move forward. — Emily Cochrane and Alan Rappeport A group of conservative health care advocates, policy experts and economists is pressing President Trump to modernize the nation’s public health data infrastructure so that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can once again be the primary collector of information about Covid-19. In a letter sent to the White House on Monday, the group, which includes former Senator Rick Santorum and other prominent conservatives, took aim at the C.D.C., saying that the agency had failed to “modernize its antiquated and burdensome public health data systems,” despite a series of laws passed by Congress in 2006, 2013 and 2019 requiring it to do so. “It is shocking that C.D.C. has failed to comply with these laws,” the authors wrote. “Despite fourteen years and billions of dollars spent, C.D.C. has yet to implement a nationwide, modern and uniform information-management and reporting system to help guide policymakers, public health officials and front-line health care workers.” The letter grew out of a report published in September by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization. C.D.C. officials were not immediately available for comment. The agency does have a data modernization plan, according to its website. During a Senate hearing in April, Dr. Robert M. Redfield, the agency’s director, was pressed on the issue by Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina. Dr. Redfield was unable to answer whether the C.D.C. had filled any of 30 staff positions created to develop the agency’s disease and public health surveillance capabilities. The reliability of health care data has become a politically charged issue during the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this year, the Department of Health and Human Services, the C.D.C.’s parent agency, stripped the C.D.C. of control over the gathering of hospital information and turned the job over to a private contractor, TeleTracking Inc. Health experts, including outside advisers to the C.D.C., warned that the move would have “serious consequences on data integrity.” But the department recently extended TeleTracking’s initial $10.2 million, six-month contract. The Heritage report described the private data collection as a “stopgap measure” that was important but “incomplete.” Joel C. White, an author of the report and a driving force behind the letter, said both “grew out of frustration” that public health officials, policy experts and journalists were relying on nongovernmental sources, like Johns Hopkins University’s Covid-19 dashboard, for coronavirus data. “Lots of people kept pointing to the C.D.C. as the source of knowledge and truth for the pandemic,” he said, “but no one was pointing to the C.D.C.’s statistics.” — Sheryl Gay Stolberg Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced on Wednesday that restrictions would be eased in some hot spots in New York City,  as the state said the rate of positive coronavirus test results had fallen in some places, while rules would be tightened in other areas. The changes would allow schools and some businesses that had been shut down in certain areas of Brooklyn and Queens to reopen, while maintaining stringent lockdowns in the hardest hit areas of Brooklyn and Rockland County. Mr. Cuomo added that the Ozone Park neighborhood in Queens would also face restrictions. Two weeks ago, Mr. Cuomo ordered the targeted restrictions, with schools and nonessential businesses in the hardest hit areas required to shut down. The lockdown — which divided virus hot spots into three color-coded zones of red, orange and yellow — were intended to combat worrisome virus test positivity rates in Brooklyn, Queens and New York City’s northern suburbs, and also imposed tight restrictions on houses of worship and restaurants. On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo provided new metrics for how the state will determine changes and updates to the color-coded boundaries. For the most serious restrictions to be lifted, an area in a red zone would have to remain under a virus positivity rate of 3 percent after 10 days, while the rates to leave orange and yellow zones would be 2 percent and 1.5 percent respectively after 10 days. He noted that in less populated areas, the benchmark would be slightly higher as “in a more rural area, you come into contact with fewer people.” The rules affected many neighborhoods with large populations of Orthodox Jewish residents and sparked an immediate backlash in some areas when they were announced earlier this month. The governor said the rules for each zone, which allowed schools that fell in yellow zones to remain open and restaurants to operate both indoor and outdoor dining, would not change. — Troy Closson  A California appellate court has ordered San Quentin State Prison, California’s oldest penitentiary, to reduce the number of inmates it holds by 50 percent, after the coronavirus tore through the facility this summer, infecting more than 2,200 inmates and killing 28. The state prison system showed “deliberate indifference” to the safety and health of San Quentin inmates by taking inadequate steps to protect them from the coronavirus, the First District Court of Appeal said Tuesday in a unanimous opinion. The ruling ordered San Quentin to reduce its population by one-half — to about 1,700 inmates — as a way to protect prisoners from infection. But because nearly all of the state’s prisons are overcrowded, it remains unclear where San Quentin inmates could be sent. In a statement on Wednesday, a California Department of Corrections spokeswoman said “we respectfully disagree with the court’s determination,” and added that the prison system had sought to stem the virus in a number of ways, including by releasing more than 21,000 inmates. Inmate transfers appear to be what created the problem in San Quentin to begin with.  The prison was  free of the coronavirus until late May, when state officials ordered 121 inmates moved there from another state prison, the California Institution for Men in Chino, Calif. Officials have acknowledged that few if any of those inmates had been tested for the coronavirus in the three weeks prior to the move, nor were they tested on arrival at San Quentin. Within weeks, San Quentin had a surging virus outbreak, and for several months the prison had the largest coronavirus cluster in the nation, according to a New York Times database. — Rebecca Griesbach and Timothy Williams Mayors from the surrounding areas of nine Big Ten schools raised concerns about potential coronavirus outbreaks linked to the league’s debut this weekend as cases rise in parts of the country. In a letter to the conference on Monday, which encompasses football powerhouses like Ohio State and Michigan State, 12 mayors noted that watch parties and gatherings of fans could increase the spread of the virus. Those types of unofficial gatherings cannot be stopped by preventing fans from entering the stadium, which the Big Ten has already committed to do. “We know the history of football games within our cities,” the mayors wrote in the letter. “They generate a lot of activity, social gatherings and consumption of alcohol.” The Big Ten promised football’s return in October so long as the schools’ football programs keep positive coronavirus tests low throughout the season. Mayors requested the conference also factor in case counts of surrounding communities when deciding whether or not to stall games. Schools in the Big Ten, which is actually made up of 14 universities, are spread across the Midwest, and reach New Jersey and Maryland. Mayors from many of the areas around the schools’ campuses — except for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Nebraska and Rutgers University — signed on. Many schools responding to the pandemic have asked students to stay inside or have shifted back to remote classes after reports of outbreaks, and some schools or local agencies have issued punishments to students caught gathering at parties or violating restrictions. Ann Arbor, Mich., home to the University of Michigan, issued an emergency stay-at-home order Tuesday for the college, effective until Nov. 3. The university allowed students to return to campus this fall with bans on large gatherings and mandatory mask wearing. Athletics were exempt from Tuesday’s stay-at-home order. The Big Ten was the first conference to postpone football this summer, only to reverse its decision in September. The conference’s season kicks off Friday with the University of Illinois against Wisconsin University. — Gillian R. Brassil GLOBAL ROUNDUP Thailand welcomed more than 10 million tourists from China last year. This week, tourism officials were pleased to announce the arrival of 39. It was the first group of foreign tourists to arrive in the kingdom in more than six months. Thailand took a big hit to its economy after it closed its borders to foreign tourists in April to contain the coronavirus. Officials have been trying for months to bring back tourists through a special visa and quarantine program and, after several false starts, the group of 39 arrived from Shanghai on Tuesday. The travelers went directly into quarantine at a Bangkok hotel, where they will remain for 14 days at their own expense. The governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Yuthasak Supasorn, said in an interview on Wednesday that he hopes the group’s arrival will open the door to travelers from other low-risk countries, such as Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. The new visa allows stays of up to 270 days. Thailand was the first country after China to report a case of coronavirus, which was brought by a tourist from Wuhan in January. But the kingdom has been among the most successful in containing the virus, reporting only 3,709 cases and 59 deaths. The challenge now is to revive the economy. During the second quarter of this year, Thailand suffered its biggest contraction since the late 1990s as the economy shrank by 12.2 percent, according to the state planning council. Although tourists were barred, thousands of Thais returned from abroad and went through quarantine. Hundreds have tested positive without any reports of the virus spreading into the community. “That is why we are confident in bringing tourists in at this time,” Mr. Yuthasak said. For now, the arrivals may throw a lifeline to a few hotels that have set themselves up as quarantine centers, but it will do little to help the struggling tourist economy. Many hotels are closed, and others are operating at a loss to satisfy demands from their lenders. In other developments around the world: The European Union has reached a deal with Johnson & Johnson that will allow the bloc to buy up to 400 million doses of the pharmaceutical company’s coronavirus vaccine. “As coronavirus spreads rapidly across Europe, we are securing doses of future vaccine to protect citizens,” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the bloc’s administrative branch, announced on Wednesday. The European Union has also signed contracts with Sanofi and AstraZeneca for up to 300 million doses of each company’s vaccine. About seven million people in the north of England will soon be living under the country’s toughest virus restrictions as large parts of the region are moved to the highest alert level in Britain’s new tiered response system. South Yorkshire will rise to the “very high” alert starting this weekend, a local official announced on Wednesday. Greater Manchester, Britain’s second-largest urban area, will also move to the highest alert level starting Friday after local leaders failed to agree on a deal with the central government in London. — Richard C. Paddock U.S. ROUNDUP This past summer, Alaska recorded some of the fewest coronavirus cases per capita in the nation. Credit isolation and wide-open spaces. But officials had also done more testing than almost every other state and then tracked every person who came back positive with an army of contact tracers. Now, as temperatures begin dipping back below freezing, the virus has seized new opportunities. Alaska’s struggles provide an early warning that winter could bring the most devastating phase of the pandemic. On Friday, the weekly case average in the state reached its highest point of the year. Along with cold-season gatherings moving into more confined spaces, there is evidence that the coronavirus is more virulent in colder weather and lower relative humidities. The state also faces some particular challenges, with officials fearing outbreaks in remote villages. Dr. Anne Zink, Alaska’s chief medical officer, described one small community with no running water that is currently dealing with an outbreak, and weather has prevented officials from getting supplies in. One of the challenges that Dr. Zink has consistently faced is convincing residents to wear masks and stay distanced. In May, when Gov. Mike Dunleavy lifted statewide restrictions, he left decisions about how to manage the pandemic to local jurisdictions. In the town of Wasilla over the weekend, people gathered at a bar for an Oktoberfest celebration. While the outdoor seating offered views of snow-capped mountains, the weather was near freezing, so people crowded inside, where no one was wearing masks. And at a youth hockey tournament this month in Anchorage, videos showed some parents watching from the stands without masks. When the tournament was over, the Anchorage Health Department announced it was investigating a “cluster” of cases linked to the games. In other developments around the United States: The National Cherry Blossom Festival’s parade — held annually in Washington, D.C., during March or April and often considered the first sign of spring in the region — has been canceled for 2021 because of virus concerns. The organization that runs the event said plans for the festival will proceed “but with changes due to ongoing restrictions caused by Covid-19.” — Mike Baker As New York City faces its first notable increase in coronavirus cases since a springtime surge killed more than 20,000, residents are again looking at their neighborhoods and wondering, after each rise in numbers, each passing siren: Is this a second wave? The recent increase prompted Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to order lockdowns in several parts of Brooklyn and Queens where the rate of positive test results has risen most sharply. The restrictions mostly affected neighborhoods with large Orthodox Jewish populations. But other neighborhoods faced partial lockdowns, including the canceling of indoor dining. On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo announced that restrictions would be eased in some hot spots in New York City, while rules would be tightened in other areas. The increases have rattled many people in those neighborhoods and beyond, reminding them of the dark days of March and April when it was impossible to meet friends, eat out at a restaurant, go to church or visit parents. Some residents are back to stockpiling medicine and rubbing alcohol, while others are putting their plans to return to their offices on indefinite hold. Some New Yorkers see the rise in cases as a harbinger, the footfalls that announce an intruder’s arrival. “I feel like the second wave is here — that same kind of doomsday feeling,” said Anya Ferring, 40, a fashion production consultant who lives in Far Rockaway, Queens, one of the neighborhoods experiencing a partial lockdown. In several interviews in the past several weeks, city residents shared deep frustrations with their fellow New Yorkers who don’t appear to be following the same rules on wearing masks and social distancing. The solidarity forged in the springtime outbreak appears, in some neighborhoods, to have fractured in the fall. Zoe Neuschatz, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, said she and her boyfriend have been mostly staying at home since the pandemic began, and they have no plans of letting up and have even considered stockpiling supplies. “Maybe it’s my post-trauma stress from the spring,” she said. “I’m a nerd about it. I take it seriously, always.” — Michael Wilson The Czech Republic on Wednesday, responding to an influx in cases that in mid-October made it the country with the highest coronavirus transmission rates in Europe, announced plans to close most shops and further tighten restrictions on movement. Last week, the country closed schools, bars, restaurants and clubs. Places serving takeout food could do so only until 8 p.m., and just through windows. Beginning Thursday and lasting until at least Nov. 3, nonessential shops will also be closed and people will be urged to keep contact to a minimum. But despite the strict new rules, the government has shied away from calling the measures a lockdown. Prime Minister Andrej Babis, speaking to the news media after a special cabinet meeting on Wednesday, apologized to the nation, saying the steps were necessary to prevent the health system from being overwhelmed. “Even though we have one of the most robust health care systems in Europe, if we did not take action, the health care system would collapse around November 7 to 11,” he said, according to Czech Television, the public broadcaster. The minister of health, Roman Prymula, who is an epidemiologist, noted during the same briefing that people should restrict their movements and contact with other people and only make necessary trips out for doctor’s appointments and essential supplies. The new measures are a stark turn from the country’s approach this spring and summer, when it appeared to have been spared the worst of the first wave of the pandemic and was able to quickly loosen restrictions. In June, 2,000 people celebrated what they saw as victory over the virus with a feast on Prague’s Charles Bridge. — Megan Specia The idea of vaccinating healthy volunteers and then deliberately infecting them with the coronavirus — a plan set in motion for the first time by scientists in London this week — carries enormous ethical difficulties. Even though young, healthy participants are unlikely to be seriously sickened or killed, the virus is unpredictable and the long-term consequences of an infection are unknown, with the pandemic having started only months ago. Beyond the ethical reservations, scientists also posed practical questions about the London researchers’ plan to compare vaccines by inoculating people and then dripping virus into their noses. For one thing, scientists stressed that several vaccine makers had already distanced themselves from the idea, known as a human challenge trial. The researchers — working with Imperial College London and hVivo, a company specializing in such studies, with backing from the British government — have not said what vaccines they will test. There are also steep limits to what scientists can learn about real-world transmission from exposing people in secure isolation units. Does a vaccine that protects healthy, younger volunteers — the only group eligible for deliberate infection — also help the people most endangered by the coronavirus, older adults or people with pre-existing conditions? And is dripping virus into a volunteer’s nose anything like the exposure people receive at work or in their homes? “Is it breathed out, sneezed out, do you sniff it all in one fell chunk of virus coming at you?” said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College. “No one really knows. It’s so hard to model.” For now, scientists overseeing the trial, scheduled to begin in January, said they would use the antiviral medicine remdesivir to treat volunteers before the onset of symptoms. The British government, under fire for its pandemic response, hopes the trial will accelerate the development of vaccines. But scientists questioned whether the fierce race for immunization had unduly influenced plans for a human challenge trial. “It’s a race for money and glory,” Prof. Moore said. “That’s the reality of it.” — Benjamin Mueller Nearly two weeks ago, President Trump told Americans that they would soon be getting an antibody treatment that he had promoted, without evidence, as a “cure” for the coronavirus. Last weekend, as the country braced for another major wave of coronavirus infections, Mr. Trump’s health secretary promised such therapies were just around the corner. But these statements are misleading, at best. Even if the drugs are proven to work — still a big if — there’s little chance that they will soon be widely available. A smooth distribution of the antibody treatments will be dependent on the very same factors that have so far bedeviled the country’s response to Covid-19: fast and plentiful testing, coordination between state and federal officials, and equitable access to health care. Supply will be extremely limited at first, even though the pool of patients who might benefit is vast, raising messy questions about who should be first in line for treatment. The drugs are believed to work best in people who have recently been infected and are not yet very sick. Roughly 60,000 Americans are testing positive for the coronavirus every day, yet the company that provided the president’s antibody treatment, Regeneron, has said it will have only 50,000 doses initially. Eli Lilly, which is developing a similar product, has said it will have 100,000 doses at first. Regeneron will eventually have 300,000 doses, and Eli Lilly will have up to one million before the end of the year. Both companies have applied to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization of their products. — Katie Thomas More than 240 people who were quarantined for the coronavirus in hotels in the Australian state of Victoria are being contacted for testing for blood-borne viruses including H.I.V., after it was found that single-use blood testing devices were used on multiple people. The revelation is part of the fallout of a failed program to quarantine Australians returning to the country in state-run hotels. The mismanagement of the scheme is widely regarded to have led to a second wave of the virus in Victoria. The outbreak put Melbourne, which is in the state of Victoria and is the second-largest city in Australia, into lockdown for over three months. On Monday, the authorities said that blood glucose monitoring devices intended for use by one person were used on multiple guests held in the hotels between March and August. The tests were used by people with diabetes to monitor blood sugar levels. (An earlier version of this post misstated where the authorities made their comments.) “Blood glucose level testing devices intended for use by one person were used across multiple residents,” Safer Care Victoria, the state’s health care quality assurance agency, said in a statement. “This presents a low clinical risk of cross-contamination and blood borne viruses — Hepatitis B and C, and H.I.V.” The agency said it did not believe the needles used for the finger-prick tests were used multiple times but said the bodies of the devices can retain microscopic amounts of blood, creating a low risk of transmission. Victoria has reported at least 20,000 coronavirus cases and more than 800 deaths, with the majority of these occurring in its second wave. The state is currently easing out of its strict lockdown as daily infection numbers drop into the single digits. — Yan Zhuang More than seven months into the nation’s coronavirus crisis, access to testing remains inconsistent, except among America’s elite. Count the University of Alabama’s football program and its coach, Nick Saban, among that elite. Anchored by one of the most celebrated brands in college football — the university claims 17 national championships, including five during Saban’s tenure — Alabama’s athletic department is among the country’s wealthiest. So at daybreak on Saturday, a private jet, the crimson “A” of the University of Alabama painted on its tail, lifted off from Tuscaloosa, Ala., en route to a testing lab in Mobile, with extraordinary cargo: cellular debris collected from Saban’s nose. Three days earlier, the coach had announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. With the case count around the football complex low and Saban an evangelist for masks and physical distancing, people in Tuscaloosa wondered whether that Wednesday test was flawed. Possibly. Alabama’s football program is administering at least 120 screenings a day, Saban suggested on ESPN on Saturday. “I’m not saying it’s inevitable, but when groups like this test a lot, the chances for a situation like this to occur increase,” said Dr. Sarah Jung, the scientific director of clinical microbiology at Children’s Hospital Colorado. On Saturday morning, still in isolation hours before second-ranked Alabama was to play third-ranked Georgia, Saban knew the specimen aboard the plane was his diagnostic lifeline to the sideline. If the Mobile lab reported that the sample was negative for the virus, Saban, who had asserted that he had no symptoms and had repeatedly tested negative after his initial result, would be allowed to leave isolation a week early and coach in the prime-time game. And so it was. Hours after a final negative result — and with no small help from a rule change that Southeastern Conference leaders approved six days before the positive test that shocked Alabama — millions of people watched on television as Saban led the Crimson Tide to a 41-24 victory. — Alan Blinder and Katherine J.
