Here’s where things stand. Pompeo predicts a ‘smooth transition to a second Trump administration.’ Biden will speak on Obamacare after the Supreme Court indicated it would uphold the bulk of the law. Disinformation and falsehoods about Biden’s victory flood social media and search engines. A Trump appointee stands between Biden’s team and a transition to a new administration. Justice Dept. official overseeing election fraud investigations takes aim at Barr in email stepping down. House leaders demand that outgoing Trump agency heads preserve records for future investigations. Trump’s refusal to concede affects Biden’s access to classified information. Hillary Clinton highlights the ‘gracious’ letter the last losing Republican president wrote to his successor. President Trump is directing money raised through his campaign’s breathless requests to “defend the election” into a new political action committee before his recount fund, a move that allows him greater flexibility to bankroll his future political endeavors. The new group, called Save America, is a federal fund-raising vehicle known as a leadership PAC that has donation limits of $5,000 per donor per year. It will be used to underwrite Mr. Trump’s post-presidential activities, tapping into the vast reservoir of small donors that made him a dominant fund-raiser, for a time, in 2020. But it is likely to have far greater significance for a man who is refusing not only to concede the election but remains reluctant to surrender the spotlight. In that sense, his PAC could become a fan-subsidized machine to perpetuate his agenda and plot his next moves. In the days since the election, Mr. Trump’s campaign has blitzed supporters with text messages and emails almost hourly, spreading unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud and asking supporters to give to the “official election defense fund.” “We need YOUR HELP to DEFEND the integrity of our Election,” read one email early Tuesday morning. The fine print shows where the money is actually going. Initially, 60 percent of donations were going to pay off debts that the Trump campaign had accumulated. But as of Tuesday, that had shifted. Now, 60 percent of donations are earmarked for Save America, which was registered with the Federal Election Commission on Monday by Bradley T. Crate. Mr. Crate also serves as Mr. Trump’s campaign treasurer. Only after a donor gives more than $5,000 does any of the money go to the recount account that Mr. Trump set up. In addition, 40 percent of every donation goes to the Republican National Committee. “Small donors who give thinking they’re helping to defend the integrity of our election are in fact largely helping to finance Trump’s post-presidential political ventures,” said Brendan M. Fischer, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group. Mr. Trump can use the new political action committee to support other candidates, as well to fund his own travel, polling and political team. Republicans will likely be clamoring for the help, given the fact that Mr. Trump matched or outperformed many down-ballot candidates in their own districts. The first test is likely to come during Georgia’s January runoff for the Senate seats occupied by the Trump loyalists David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. The outcome will decide which party controls the Senate. Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, said on Monday that the leadership PAC had been planned before the election. “The president always planned to do this, win or lose, so he can support candidates and issues he cares about, such as combating voter fraud,” Mr. Murtaugh said. Leadership PACs are generally seen as loosely regulated — Joseph R. Biden Jr. operated one during the 2018 midterms ahead of his own presidential run — and the committee gives the Mr. Trump a place to continue to direct supporter cash. One advantage for Mr. Trump is that the leadership PAC gives him more latitude than the recount account, which is more limited in its use, according to campaign finance experts. “There is far more flexibility with how a candidate can use a leadership PAC than a recount account,” Mr. Fischer said. — Shane Goldmacher, Maggie Haberman and Rachel Shorey TRANSCRIPT Reporter: “Is the State Department currently preparing to engage with the Biden transition team? And if not, at what point does a delay hamper a smooth transition or pose a risk to national security?” “There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration. All right, we’re ready. The world is watching what’s taking place. We’re going to count all the votes. When the process is complete, they’ll be electors selected. There’s a process — the Constitution lays it out pretty clearly. The world should have every confidence that the transition necessary to make sure that the State Department is functional today, successful today and successful with the president who’s in office on Jan. 20, a minute after noon, will also be successful. I went through a transition on the front, and I’ve been on the other side of this. I’m very confident that we will do all the things that are necessary to make sure that the government, the United States goverment, will continue to perform its national security function as we go forward.” Reporter: “Do you believe there’s widespread voter fraud? The reports that we’re getting from Pennsylvania, from Michigan, showing vote totals of massive leads or significant leads with 99 percent reporting are going to be overturned, and that the United States failed to conduct a fraudulent-free election?” “Rich, I’m the secretary of state. I’m getting calls from all across the world. These people are watching our election. They understand that we have a legal process. They understand that this takes time. Right — took us 37-plus days in an election back in 2000. Conducted a successful transition then, I’m very confident that we will count, and we must count, every legal vote. We must make sure that any vote that wasn’t lawful ought not be counted. That dilutes your vote if it’s done improperly. Got to get that right. When we get it right, we’ll get it right — we’re in good shape.” WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday echoed President Trump’s baseless demand to delay the election results until “every legal vote” is counted, and he predicted in a deadpan voice, followed by a chuckle and a grin, that “there will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration.” It was not clear if he was joking and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for clarity. The remark came before a testy exchange with journalists at the State Department, during which Mr. Pompeo insisted that American efforts worldwide to prevent voter intimidation and ensure free and fair elections were not diminished by Mr. Trump’s refusal to concede the U.S. presidential race, even after official vote tallies showed on Saturday that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had won, becoming president-elect. He is the latest Republican to decline to publicly recognize President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory, although he also promised to ensure that the State Department remains functional and secure between now and Inauguration Day. “I’m getting calls from all across the world,” Mr. Pompeo said. “These people are watching our election, they understand that we have a legal process. They understand that this takes time.” He added: “We must count every legal vote. We must make sure that any vote that wasn’t lawful ought not be counted. That dilutes your vote if it’s done improperly. We’ve got to get that right.” Hours earlier, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey became one of the few remaining world leaders who had initially resisted congratulating Mr. Biden to reverse course and acknowledge the Democrat as the victor. Last week, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe warned that the “highly competitive” American elections — followed by Mr. Trump casting doubt on the results — had been “tarnished by legal uncertainty and unprecedented attempts to undermine public trust.” The United States has long supported the organization’s efforts to call out sham elections and corrupt governments. But Mr. Pompeo appeared to seethe on Tuesday when asked if Mr. Trump’s delaying tactics undermined the State Department’s efforts to pressure political leaders abroad to accept losing results. “That’s ridiculous and you know it’s ridiculous, and you asked it because it’s ridiculous,” he said. In monitoring foreign elections, “we often encounter situations where it’s not clear,” he said. “We work to undercover facts, we work to do discovery, to learn whether in fact the outcome, the decision that was made, reflected the will of the people.” “We want every one of those votes to be counted in the same way, that we have every expectation that every vote here in the United States will be counted too,” he said. — Lara Jakes WILMINGTON, Del. — President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. plans to deliver a health care speech this afternoon focusing on the Trump administration’s effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act, hours after the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case and indicated it was unlikely to strike down the law. The law, pushed by former President Barack Obama, provides insurance coverage for tens of millions of Americans, guaranteeing covering for pre-existing medical conditions and providing other popular provisions, including coverage for prescription drugs and visits to the emergency room. But President Trump and Republican state officials argue that a key provision of the law — the mandate that individuals purchase insurance — is unconstitutional because Congress reduced the penalty to zero, removing the justification that it was essentially a tax. The Supreme Court had upheld that justification in 2015. It was not clear whether the court would strike down the mandate. But at least five justices, including two members of the court’s conservative majority, suggested that doing so would not invalidate the rest of the law. Mr. Biden made the fate of the Affordable Care Act a central part of his campaign for the White House, arguing that if Republicans succeeded in convincing the justices to declare the law unconstitutional, Mr. Trump was not prepared to offer people an alternative for coverage. The president-elect has said he wants to strengthen the A.C.A. by offering a so-called public option, allowing people to receive coverage the way Medicare enrollees do, through a system of government-run insurance. People who would prefer to stay on private insurance would be able to do so. In his remarks today, Mr. Biden plans to talk about “the stakes for families across the country in Texas v. California, the Trump administration’s lawsuit to overturn the Affordable Care Act, and his plan to expand access to quality, affordable health care,” according to a statement released by his transition team. Officials said that Mr. Biden would be joined at the event by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who as a candidate for president had pushed a health care plan that was intended to expand coverage, but stopped short of the “Medicare for all” single-payer system of government health insurance favored by liberal Democrats. The Affordable Care Act has survived two earlier challenges in the Supreme Court. But three new justices, all Trump appointees, have joined the court since the last one. One of them, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, has been publicly critical of the earlier rulings. — Michael D. Shear and Adam Liptak As President Trump and his team continue to circulate fabricated claims of a stolen election and voter fraud, their allies are flooding the internet search engines and social media with falsehoods intended to question the legitimacy of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory. This dynamic — the Trump team broadcasting misinformation, which is then plugged into the high-wattage amplifier of social media — was a defining feature of Mr. Trump’s campaign and administration and has, if anything, intensified in the wake of his defeat. One particular brazen example surfaced early Tuesday. Some users who entered the search phrase “Biden loses PA” into Google — not an uncommon search given Mr. Trump’s claims — were directed to a page topped with a YouTube video entitled “Biden Loses Pennsylvania and Loses President-Elect Status.” If the term “Biden loses” is entered, another video entitled “Breaking News!!! Biden Loses President-Elect Status” appears for some users as the top video result. These claims are false. Many Republicans have privately conceded that Mr. Trump’s path to victory is nonexistent but have been reluctant to challenge him. On Monday, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, refused to acknowledge Mr. Biden as the president-elect and said Mr. Trump was “100 percent” within his rights to pursue legal remedies. As of Tuesday morning, Mr. Biden was ahead by more than 45,000 votes in Pennsylvania, and while counting is still going on, his lead is insurmountable, according to analysts. While Mr. Trump’s allies have focused their legal fights on Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia, Mr. Biden’s margins of victory in those states are also highly unlikely to be overturned. The first video, posted by an obscure YouTube user, touts a debunked and fictitious claim that the political website RealClearPolitics rescinded Mr. Biden’s win in Pennsylvania, and hence revoked his status as president-elect. While most major news outlets, including The New York Times, called the race for Mr. Biden on Saturday, RealClearPolitics has been more cautious. It has not declared a winner, pending the outcomes in several states, including North Carolina and Alaska, where Mr. Trump is currently ahead. That did not stop Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s lawyer, who has claimed — without providing evidence — that Democrats stole the election, from posting a tweet late Monday claiming the site had taken away Pennsylvania and made it a “toss up.” Tom Bevan, who runs RealClearPolitics, quickly shot back, “This is false. We never called Pennsylvania, and nothing has changed.” Mr. Giuliani, who has roughly one million followers on Twitter, did not remove his post. He did not immediately return multiple requests for comment. The falsehood was posted by a verified account, The Next News Network; it gained nearly 900,000 views in just 12 hours, largely driven by shares on Facebook. Data from the Facebook-owned social media analytics tool CrowdTangle suggests that 97 percent of Facebook likes and shares happened in private Facebook groups. On Google, search interest in “Biden loses Pennsylvania” jumped 1,150 percent in a little over an hour, peaking at 8:52 p.m., according to data from Google Trends. Pam Bondi, another Trump legal adviser who has 110,000 followers, tweeted out a similar message, but deleted it late Monday. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump’s former press secretary, took it a step further, appending a correction to his original tweet echoing the claim. But the misinformation has spread through Facebook and Twitter anyway. “If you thought disinformation on Facebook was a problem during our election, just wait until you see how it is shredding the fabric of our democracy in the days after,” Bill Russo, a Biden press aide who has criticized social media companies, tweeted on Monday. YouTube said the viral video flagged by The Times had been labeled but does not violate its deceptive practices policy, which prohibits misleading viewers about how to vote but doesn’t ban expressing views on an election’s outcome. — Glenn Thrush, Linda Qiu and Davey Alba Transition officials for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. called on a top Trump administration appointee on Monday to end what they said was unwarranted obstruction of the money and access that federal law says must flow to the winner of a presidential election. The officials, speaking on background to reporters on Monday night, said it was nearly unprecedented for Emily W. Murphy, the administrator of the General Services Administration, to refuse to issue a letter of “ascertainment,” which allows Mr. Biden’s transition team to begin the transfer of power. By law, Ms. Murphy, the head of the sprawling agency that keeps the federal government functioning, must formally recognize Mr. Biden as the incoming president for his transition to begin. It has been three days since news organizations projected that he was the winner of the election, and Ms. Murphy has still not acted. The transition officials said her inaction was preventing Mr. Biden’s teams from moving into government offices, including secure facilities where they can discuss classified information. The teams cannot meet with their counterparts in agencies or begin background checks of cabinet nominees that require top-secret access. A White House official pointed out, as several Trump allies have, that the transition after the 2000 election was delayed by the court fight between the campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas over several weeks. The official said it would be strange for President Trump to send some kind of a signal to allow the transition to start while he was still engaged in court fights. But Mr. Biden’s aides said that the dispute in 2000 involved one state with only about 500 ballots separating the winner and loser, far less than in the current contest. In every other presidential race for the past 60 years, the determination of a winner was made within 24 hours, the aides said — even as legal challenges and recounts continued for weeks. A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a question about whether Mr. Trump was willing to let Ms. Murphy begin the transition without a concession from him. — Michael D. Shear, Maggie Haberman and Michael Crowley The top Justice Department official overseeing election fraud investigations took aim at Attorney General William P. Barr as he abruptly departed the post, telling colleagues that he had stepped aside in an attempt to protect the department’s integrity. Mr. Barr informed federal prosecutors on Monday that they were allowed to investigate “specific allegations” of voter fraud before the results of the presidential race were certified. In explaining his move, the official, Richard Pilger, said that his decision was rooted in an award that he had won several years earlier that recognizes a department official who “displayed extraordinary strength of character in a unique situation.” Mr. Pilger plans to stay at the Justice Department in a nonsupervisory role. Here is the text of the email he sent to colleagues, absent a redaction: Dear Colleagues, Attached please find the Attorney General’s Memorandum of today entitled “Post-Voting Election Irregularity Inquiries,” an important new policy abrogating the forty-year-old Non-Interference Policy for ballot fraud investigations in the period prior to elections becoming certified and uncontested. Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses, pp. 84-85 (8th Ed. 2017). Having familiarized myself with the new policy and its ramifications, and in accord with the best tradition of the John C. Keeney Award for Exceptional Integrity and Professionalism (my most cherished Departmental recognition), I must regretfully resign from my role as Director of the Election Crimes Branch. I have enjoyed very much working with you for over a decade to aggressively and diligently enforce federal criminal election law, policy, and practice without partisan fear or favor. I thank you for your support in that effort. The Acting Director of the Election Crimes Branch going forward will be PIN Deputy Chief Robert J. Heberle [redacted text]. Deputy Director Sean F. Mulryne will remain in his position. Please give them both the same support that I have enjoyed, and rest assured that he Public Integrity Section remains committed to operating properly in all of its functions. Best Wishes, RCP The department created the John C. Keeney Award for Exceptional Integrity and Professionalism a decade ago to recognize department officials who showed integrity over a long career and “displayed extraordinary strength of character in a unique situation.” Mr. Keeney was the longest-tenured department prosecutor in history. He worked under 12 presidents and 23 attorneys general over 60 years, according to the Justice Department. He retired in 2010 as a top official in the department’s criminal division in Washington. During World War II, Mr. Keeney was shot down during an allied bombing campaign over Germany and held in a Nazi camp until the conclusion of the war. Six years later, he was hired by the Justice Department as a prosecutor. Early Tuesday, the top lawyer for the Biden campaign joined the chorus of Democrats and civil rights lawyers condemning Mr. Barr’s decision. “It is deeply unfortunate that the Attorney General Barr chose to issue a memorandum that will only fuel the ‘specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims’ he professes to guard against,” said the Biden lawyer, Bob Bauer. “Those are the very kind of claims that the president and his lawyers are making unsuccessfully every day, as their lawsuits are laughed out of one court after another.” — Michael S. Schmidt and Katie Benner Worried that the Trump administration might destroy files as its members leave the White House, the Democratic heads of 21 House committees sent letters on Tuesday to more than 50 federal agencies, demanding they comply with federal record-keeping laws and preserve information sought in congressional subpoenas and investigations. “As the Trump administration prepares for the transition of power to the new Biden administration, we write to remind you that all Executive Office of the President employees and officials must comply with record preservation obligations set forth in federal law and preserve information relevant to congressional oversight,” wrote the chairs of the committees, including Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform. Among the demands in the letters were orders for the White House to preserve all records in accordance with the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act, as well as any documents that may be requested as part of a congressional investigation. “You are obligated to ensure that any information previously requested by Congress — and any other information that is required by law to be preserved — is saved and appropriately archived in a manner that is easily retrievable,” the Democrats wrote. House Democrats have opened numerous investigations into the Trump administration during the president’s four years in office, including, most recently, probes into Customs and Border Protection agents who allegedly engaged in misconduct, attempts to withhold federal funds from local jurisdictions, and the performance of the Postal Service. — Luke Broadwater While President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been projected the winner in the 2020 election, states across the country are still tallying votes. The Times has yet to call winners in four states, and in two — Arizona and Georgia — Mr. Biden currently leads. Mr. Biden has already won the election. Even if President Trump was able to overtake Mr. Biden in one or both states, and hold onto the two outstanding states where he is leading, North Carolina and Alaska, that fact would not change. In Georgia, Mr. Biden leads President Trump by over 12,000 votes as of Tuesday afternoon, or about a quarter of a percentage point. The secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, said Friday that there were 8,400 military and overseas ballots that had been sent out and could still be returned, as well as 14,200 provisional ballots that had been received by election officials. Some additional ballots have been counted since Mr. Raffensperger made those remarks. But provisional ballots must all be inspected and counted by hand, and take an exceptionally long time to process and count, and the deliberative nature of tabulating those ballots has slowed the reporting of results in Georgia. Mr. Biden has been winning the provisional ballots there so far, and those left to count might help pad his lead in the state even further. Then a recount is “inevitable,” according to Mr. Raffensperger, but Mr. Biden’s lead is so large that the results are extremely unlikely to be reversed. In Arizona, Mr. Trump continues to make gains on Mr. Biden, now trailing him by less than 15,000 votes, or about four-tenths of a percentage point. But the president is running out of opportunities to close the gap in the state. Only about 60,000 votes remain to be counted in Arizona, and Mr. Trump would need to win them by more than 20 points to take the lead. But Mr. Trump hasn’t been winning the count by such a large margin in recent days. The remaining ballots might be even better for Mr. Biden. More than half of the remaining ballots are provisional ballots, and more than half of those are from the heavily Democratic Pima County. — Nick Corasaniti and Nate Cohn Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, will continue to steer their respective parties in the 117th Congress, though it remains unclear which man will be majority leader given the prospect of two Senate runoff races in Georgia. Both men were unanimously re-elected Tuesday morning by acclamation, as both the Democratic caucus and Republican conference held private meetings on Capitol Hill to select leadership for the next Congress. The handful of new senators-elect, who have yet to be sworn in, were also on hand to participate in the process. “A few weeks ago, someone called him the Apex Predator of American politics, which may be the best yet,” Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said in remarks formally nominating Mr. McConnell, the longest serving Republican leader in the Senate’s history. “I nominate as our leader, the Apex Predator of the United States Senate, Addison Mitchell McConnell Jr.” Very little upheaval was expected on either side, with Senate Democrats maintaining the same leadership team and Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois remaining as the No. 2 Democrat, according to a Democrat familiar with the results. The caucus also agreed to add two senators, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, expanding the Democratic leadership ranks to 10 members besides Mr. Schumer and Mr. Durbin. The caucus will wait until later in the year to decide committee assignments and who will oversee the Senate Democratic campaign arm. Senate Republicans kept Senator John Thune of South Dakota as the conference whip, the No. 2 position, as well as Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, Joni Ernst of Iowa, and Roy Blunt of Missouri in top positions. They elected Senator Rick Scott of Florida, the state’s former governor, to lead Senate Republicans’ campaign arm. “We’re ready to get going even though there is some suspense about whether we will be in the majority or not. That will be answered in Georgia on Jan. 5,” Mr. McConnell said. Pressed by reporters, he once again declined to recognize President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory and insisted President Trump’s decision to challenge the results by spreading baseless claims of widespread fraud “should not be alarming.” — Emily Cochrane and Nicholas Fandos President Trump’s refusal to concede the election to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has already affected Mr. Biden’s transition, particularly on national security issues. Mr. Biden has yet to receive a presidential daily briefing, the compendium of the government’s latest secrets and best intelligence insights. And while no law states that Mr. Biden must receive it, previous administrations, dating to at least 1968, have authorized their elected successors to be given the briefing after clinching victory. It was also unclear whether Mr. Biden’s team would have access to classified information, the most important pipeline for them to learn about the threats facing the United States. At the same time, a Trump loyalist known as fierce partisan has been appointed as the top lawyer at the National Security Agency, a sign that the administration is trying to help its political appointees land career posts that they can stay in even after a new president is sworn in, American officials said. The appointee, Michael Ellis, had served as a National Security Council lawyer and most recently as its senior director for intelligence. Formerly a lawyer for the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, he gained notoriety as one of two White House aides who helped his previous boss, Representative Devin Nunes, gain access to intelligence reports in early 2017 to advance Mr. Trump’s political goals. Like previous presidents-elect, Mr. Biden is receiving Secret Service protection, and a no-fly zone has been established over his home in Delaware. But if Mr. Trump’s administration continues its refusal to recognize Mr. Biden as the winner, it could complicate his security until his inauguration. Former agency officials say the Secret Service is highly unlikely to begin that transition unless the G.S.A. has authorized it. — Michael S. Schmidt, Julian E. Barnes and Zolan Kanno-Youngs Providing another example of how President Trump’s reaction to his election loss differs from other presidents’, Hillary Clinton on Tuesday posted a letter that an outgoing president, George H.W. Bush, wrote to an incoming one, Bill Clinton, in 1993. “You will be our president when you read this note,” Mr. Bush, a Republican and the last incumbent to lose re-election, wrote to Mr. Clinton, his Democratic successor, on Inauguration Day. “Your success is now our country’s success. I am rooting hard for you. Good luck.” “Here’s how it’s done in America,” Mrs. Clinton wrote on Instagram, describing the letter as “gracious.” “Since the very beginning, American presidents have accepted the will of the people and participated in a peaceful transfer of power,” she wrote. “That’s what makes our democracy so unique, and so enduring.” To be fair, Mr. Trump has 71 days to pen a similar note to Mr. Biden. But based on how things are going so far, that gesture appears unlikely. Mr. Trump has shattered Washington’s norms for four years, has yet to concede he lost the election and is stalling the start of a peaceful transition period, breaking from longstanding precedent. Mr. Bush was the last one-term president before Mr. Trump. But the similarities stop there. “Here’s the way we see it and the country should see it — that the people have spoken and we respect the majesty of the democratic system,” Mr. Bush said in the concession speech he delivered on election night in 1992. “I just called Governor Clinton over in Little Rock and offered my congratulations. He did run a strong campaign. I wish him well in the White House.” Transitions have faced roadblocks before. The most recent — in 2016, when Mr. Trump prepared to take over from President Barack Obama — was rocky and behind schedule because of shake-ups on Mr. Trump’s team. Eight years earlier, Mr. Obama’s transition faced snags because he had to replace his head of personnel multiple times. — Eileen Sullivan Last weekend, as Democrats danced in the streets to celebrate the election of Joseph R. Biden Jr., QAnon believers were on their computers, trying to make sense of it all. “Biden will NEVER be president,” wrote one. “Trump knows what he is doing,” wrote another on a QAnon forum. “He is letting the Dems, technocrats and media publicly hang themselves.” Some QAnon adherents, however, were already inching toward acceptance. “We’re losing,” one tweeted. “Not sure I trust the plan anymore. Not sure there even is a plan.” These are trying times for believers in QAnon, the conspiracy theory built around the baseless claim that there is a Fsatanic pedophile cult run by top Democrats. For years, they had been assured that Mr. Trump would win in a landslide and spend his second term vanquishing the deep state and bringing the cabal’s leaders to justice. Q, the message board user whose posts have fueled the movement for more than three years, told them to “trust the plan.” But since Mr. Trump’s defeat, Q has fallen silent on 8kun, the website where all of Q’s posts appear.  QAnon-related activity on the site has slowed to a trickle — one recent day, there were fewer new posts on 8kun’s most active QAnon board than on its board for adult-diaper fetishists. There are also signs of infighting among QAnon’s inner circle. Ron Watkins, an 8kun administrator who some believed was Q himself, announced on Election Day that he was stepping down from the site, citing “extensive battles” over censorship and the site’s future. Though QAnon has had some success infiltrating the Republican Party — an adherent won a congressional race in Georgia last week — the movement has been dealing with other setbacks. QAnon followers have been banned from most major social media platforms, deflating the movement’s momentum and depriving it of its most effective organizing tools. Facebook groups and YouTube channels with hundreds of thousands of subscribers disappeared overnight. — Kevin Roose A week after Election Day, ballots are still being counted in many states. This isn’t unusual. But because so many people voted by mail this year, the process isn’t as far along as it would normally be. Aside from the presidential contest in four states — Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Alaska — two Senate races and about 20 House races were unresolved as of Tuesday morning. That’s in addition to planned runoffs for Georgia’s two Senate seats and a Louisiana House seat in the coming months. These are some of races we’re watching: Alaska: The Republican incumbents Senator Dan Sullivan and Representative Don Young both hold substantial leads. Arizona: Representative Tom O’Halleran, a Democrat, is ahead of his Republican challenger, Tiffany Shedd, by about 12,000 votes. California: Five House races remain uncalled. The closest include one in the San Joaquin Valley, where Representative T.J. Cox, a Democrat, trails former Representative David Valadao, the Republican, by about 4,500 votes, and one north of Los Angeles where Representative Mike Garcia, a Republican, trails Christy Smith, a Democrat, by about 1,000 votes. Illinois: Representative Lauren Underwood, a first-term Democrat, has pulled narrowly ahead of her Republican challenger, Jim Oberweis, in Chicago’s western suburbs. Iowa: One of the nation’s closest House races is in the Second Congressional District, which covers the southeast part of the state. Just 35 votes separate Rita Hart, a Democrat, from Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican. New York: Eight House races, including some that are not close, remain uncalled because New York has been slow to start counting mail ballots. Close ones include the 18th District in New York City’s northern exurbs, where Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat, leads his Republican challenger, Chele Farley, by just over two points, and District 19 in the Hudson Valley, where Representative Antonio Delgado, a first-term Democrat, is narrowly ahead of his Republican challenger, Kyle Van De Water. North Carolina: The Republican Senator Thom Tillis is narrowly ahead of his Democratic challenger, Cal Cunningham. Texas: The 24th Congressional District in the northern suburbs between Fort Worth and Dallas is the last opportunity for Democrats to flip a district in Texas. With 95 percent of estimated votes counted, Beth Van Duyne, a Republican, narrowly leads Candace Valenzuela. Utah: Representative Ben McAdams, a Democrat whose 2018 victory was one of the biggest upsets of the midterms, trails his Republican challenger, Burgess Owens, by less than half a percentage point. Washington: Representative Kim Schrier, a first-term Democrat, leads her Republican challenger, Jesse Jensen, by about 3.5 percentage points in the Eighth District southeast of Seattle. — Maggie Astor President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke Tuesday morning with the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, in his second known phone call with a foreign leader since he won the election. His first was with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada on Monday. While Mr. Biden’s transition team did not immediately release a readout of the call, Mr. Johnson tweeted that he had congratulated Mr. Biden on his victory and that he looked forward “to working with him on our shared priorities — from tackling climate change, to promoting democracy and building back better from the pandemic.” The wording was noteworthy coming from Mr. Johnson, who has often been ideologically aligned with Mr. Trump: “Build back better” was a central slogan of Mr. Biden’s campaign. Mr. Biden has also pledged to rejoin the Paris climate agreement, which was signed by almost every country. Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the accord in 2017. Mr. Johnson’s office also told reporters that he had invited Mr. Biden to the United Nations Climate Change Conference, scheduled to be held in Glasgow next November. Numerous foreign leaders have acknowledged Mr. Biden’s victory, including Mr. Johnson, Mr. Trudeau, President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. The acknowledgments from Mr. Johnson and Mr. Netanyahu were particularly significant because they have had friendlier relationships than most other world leaders with the Trump administration.
