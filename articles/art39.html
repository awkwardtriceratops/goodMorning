With the presidency hanging in the balance, the counting continued, and Biden’s lead in Nevada grew. Georgia: Biden closes in on Trump, with a final result expected today. The path to 270: Here is the state of play in states that could decide the presidency. Nevada: Biden widens his advantage in a surprising battleground. Pennsylvania: Biden chips away at Trump’s lead with votes still left to tally. Arizona: Biden’s lead narrows, and more results will come tonight. With the presidency hanging in the balance, attention shifted Thursday to a handful of states that remained too close to call but where, on balance, Joseph R. Biden Jr. seemed to have an advantage. President Trump’s campaign pressed ahead with lawsuits challenging the validity of the count in several states, and protests erupted in cities and outside some elections offices. It was a tense day, as supporters of both candidates were riveted by the slow vote counts underway in several states. Mr. Biden needed 17 more electoral votes to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to win, while Mr. Trump needed 56 more. As results trickled in from several states, Mr. Biden increased his lead in Nevada and slowly eroded Mr. Trump’s leads in Georgia and Pennsylvania while Mr. Trump made up some ground in Arizona, where Mr. Biden was ahead. Both campaigns tried to project optimism, and ask for patience. “The story of today is going to be a very positive story for the vice president but also one where folks are going to need to stay patient and stay calm,” Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, said during a press briefing on Thursday. “The counting is happening; it’s going to take time.” Mr. Trump’s campaign team said that it would likely be filing additional legal actions. Bill Stepien, the campaign manager, accused people of prematurely writing Mr. Trump off at various junctures since the 2016 presidential primaries. “Donald Trump is alive and well,” he said. On Wednesday Mr. Biden had stopped short of declaring victory, as Mr. Trump did prematurely on election night, and sought to strike a conciliatory note when he addressed the nation. But he also had something of a warning for the Trump team. “Power can’t be taken or asserted,” he said. “It flows from the people. And it’s their will that determines who will be the president of the United States, and their will alone.” Mr. Trump issued a written statement on Thursday afternoon through his campaign in which he made baseless claims that there could be fraud in the late votes, writing that “if you count the illegal and late votes, they can steal the election from us!” The statement, which was written in all capital letters, resembled one of his tweets — but by issuing it through the campaign, the president avoided getting a warning label from Twitter, which has flagged many of his recent tweets as potentially misleading.   With Mr. Trump’s political path growing more precarious, his team increasingly turned to the courts, filing lawsuits in several states and demanding a recount in Wisconsin. The Trump campaign’s bid to stave off defeat stretched to the Supreme Court, where the campaign intervened in a case challenging Pennsylvania’s plan to count ballots received for up to three days after Election Day. In some states the campaign showed a willingness to take legal action to fight over even small batches of votes. In a fraught moment for supporters of both candidates, the tensions occasionally started to spill into the streets. Calling on election officials to “count every vote,” protesters marched through the streets of several American cities on Wednesday, with protests in Minneapolis, Seattle, Phoenix, Philadelphia, New York City and Portland, Ore. At the same time, supporters of Mr. Trump descended on vote-counting facilities in several contested states. In Phoenix, about 150 pro-Trump protesters, some of them armed, gathered outside the county recorder’s office where a closely watched count of votes that could help determine the outcome of the election was being conducted. And in Detroit, another group of pro-Trump poll watchers gathered earlier in the day outside a ballot-counting center, demanding that officials “stop the count” of ballots after the Trump campaign filed suit to halt the count in Michigan. But inside, the democratic process continued to play out as election workers — socially distanced and wearing masks — went about their job: counting the votes. — Michael Cooper, Maggie Haberman, Katie Glueck, Thomas Kaplan, Mark Landler and Marc Santora ATLANTA — President Trump’s lead in Georgia over Joseph R. Biden Jr. shrank to less than 14,000 votes Thursday afternoon, as election workers scrambled to tally the last 60,000 absentee ballots. “I am prayerful that we can get to a resolution by the end of the day,” Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s statewide voting system implementation manager, said at a news conference at the state Capitol. He said the state would also have to process an unknown number of overseas, military and provisional ballots. It was unclear how many of those were still outstanding. “The election is not over just on the absentee ballots,” Mr. Sterling said. Mr. Trump’s lead over Mr. Biden has dwindled to 0.3 percent. If the race ends with a margin of less than half a percentage point, contestants can ask for a recount. A lawsuit filed by the Trump campaign and the state Republican Party challenging the Georgia returns was dismissed on Thursday by a superior court judge. The lawsuit had alleged that absentee ballots that arrived after the election night deadline were wrongly counted in Savannah. State G.O.P. officials said they planned to file up to a dozen suits. Many of the votes left to be counted are in counties that lean Democratic, including suburbs of Atlanta and the county that includes Savannah. Early Thursday afternoon, election workers at State Farm Arena in Atlanta burst into applause as they finished processing the last of 145,748 mail-in ballots for Fulton County, home to most of Atlanta. But they were not done. More than 3,600 provisional ballots in the county remain to be processed, along with any outstanding military and overseas ballots, which have until 5 p.m. Friday to arrive. — Richard Fausset and Leighton Rowell With votes in a handful of states still being tallied Thursday afternoon, Joseph R. Biden Jr. was 17 electoral votes shy of reaching the 270 Electoral College votes that he will need to win the election, while President Trump needed to win 56 more electoral votes. Mr. Biden had more paths to victory open to him: 27 different combinations of the remaining states would give the presidency, while only four different combinations would re-elect Mr. Trump (and one path would result in a tie). Here is the state of play in the race in the remaining battleground states as of 2 p.m. Eastern on Thursday. Electoral votes: 16
Trump leads Biden, 49.5 percent to 49.2 percent, with more than 95 percent of the estimated vote in.
Gap: about 13,500 votes.
Keep in mind: Georgia’s voting system implementation manager said early Thursday morning that about 60,000 outstanding mail-in absentee ballots remained uncounted. Most are in Democratic-leaning counties. The state aims to finish its count by noon. Electoral votes: 20
Trump leads Biden, 50.3 percent to 48.5 percent, with about 92 percent of the estimated vote in.
Gap: about 114,000 votes.
Keep in mind: Pennsylvania’s secretary of state said Thursday afternoon that about 500,000 ballots remained to be counted and that she hoped a winner could be announced by the end of the day. Most of the votes yet to be counted are in counties where Mr. Biden is ahead, including Philadelphia, the state’s most populous county, where Mr. Biden leads by about 60 percentage points. But plenty of votes are outstanding in dozens of Trump-leaning counties. Mr. Biden needs to win nearly two-thirds of the remaining votes to win the state. The vote tally is being continually updated. Electoral votes: 6
Biden leads Trump, 49.5 percent to 48.5 percent, with 87 percent of the estimated vote in.
Gap: about 11,000 votes.
Keep in mind: All of the Election Day vote has been counted, leaving only Democratic-leaning late mail and provisional ballots to be tabulated. Vote totals are being continually updated. Electoral votes: 11
Biden leads Trump, 50.5 percent to 48.1 percent, with 86 percent of the estimated vote in.
Gap: about 68,000 votes.
To keep in mind: Mr. Trump needs to win about 60 percent of the remaining votes to capture the state. More results are expected to be released Thursday night. Electoral votes: 15
Trump leads Biden, 50.1 percent to 48.7 percent, with 95 percent of the estimated vote in.
Gap: about 77,000 votes.
Keep in mind: With most votes now tabulated, Mr. Biden would need to win about two-thirds of the remainder to pull ahead. Mail ballots postmarked by Election Day will be accepted until Thursday, Nov. 12. Democrats’ sputtering hopes of reclaiming the Senate are on the edge of getting a boost, as Senator David Perdue, the Republican incumbent in Georgia, could be forced into a runoff with his Democratic challenger if his vote share falls any lower as the state’s final votes are counted. As of Thursday morning, with an estimated 95 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Perdue had just under 50 percent of the vote against Jon Ossoff, who had 47.7 percent. Under Georgia law, if Mr. Perdue finishes below 50 percent, he’ll face Mr. Ossoff in a one-on-one vote in January. The Ossoff campaign said Thursday that the race was on track to require a runoff. “The votes are still being counted, but we are confident that Jon Ossoff’s historic performance in Georgia has forced Senator David Perdue to continue defending his indefensible record of unemployment, disease, and corruption,” Mr. Ossoff’s campaign manager, Ellen Foster, said in a statement. Mr. Perdue’s campaign manager, Ben Fry, said in a statement that if “overtime is required when all of the votes have been counted, we’re ready, and we will win.” There will already be one runoff election in Georgia: Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican, will face the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat. On Wednesday, Mr. Warnock shared a pre-emptive video parodying the attacks he expects Ms. Loeffler to launch against him. The ad claims Mr. Warnock hates puppies and eats pizza with a fork and knife. “Get ready Georgia, the negative ads are coming,” Mr. Warnock said. Get ready Georgia. The negative ads against us are coming.

But that won’t stop us from fighting for a better future for Georgians and focusing on the issues that matter. pic.twitter.com/VN0YIA02MG If Democrats were able to win both seats, and if Joseph R. Biden, Jr. wins the presidency, they would have the 50 senators needed to usher through judicial and cabinet appointments, and enact a Democratic agenda. If Republicans maintain control, they could exert their power to block the priorities of a Biden administration. If President Trump prevails, the Democrats would need to achieve the enormously difficult feat of winning both Georgia seats and the North Carolina seat held by Senator Thom Tillis, who is nearly two percentage points ahead of his Democratic challenger, Cal Cunningham, with 94 percent of the votes tallied. The extra seat would be required because the vice president casts the tie-breaking vote in the Senate. Mr. Tillis has already declared victory. Though Democrats flipped Republican-held seats in Colorado and Arizona, they lost one in Alabama and failed to capture seats in several other states in which they invested enormous sums of money. But a second Georgia runoff would extend their hopes through January, and focus the nation’s attention squarely on the Peach State. Georgia election officials are expected to release additional vote totals Thursday morning. — Daniel Victor Joseph R. Biden Jr. widened his slender lead over President Trump in Nevada on Thursday from about 8,000 votes to about 12,000 votes as another tranche of ballots were counted, election officials announced. Mr. Biden now leads Mr. Trump by one percentage point. Nevada has six electoral votes and its entire Election Day vote has been counted; the late mail and provisional ballots that remain lean Democratic. About 13 percent of the state’s votes have yet to be tabulated. But the final results might not be made public until Saturday or Sunday, said Joe Gloria, elections registrar in Clark County, home to Las Vegas, during a news conference at his headquarters. His staff will began to tabulate 63,262 drop-off, mail-in and provisional ballots on Friday, and likely will not release the results for a day or two, Mr. Gloria told reporters. “Our goal is not to act fast,” but to accurately count the votes, he said to audible groaning in the room. Mr. Gloria said he had beefed up security amid threats to his staff, adding, “We will not allow anyone to stop us from doing what our duty is.” A key question is whether Mr. Trump can close Mr. Biden’s current lead of eight percentage points in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas and most of Nevada’s population. In 2016, Hillary Clinton carried that county by 10.7 percentage points. The Trump campaign has already identified Nevada, which allows any losing candidate to request a recount, as one of the battleground states where it plans to use the courts and procedural maneuvers to stave off defeat in the Electoral College. Less than 24 hours before Election Day, a Nevada judge rejected a lawsuit filed by Republicans who had tried to stop early vote counting in Clark County. Nevada’s attorney general, Aaron Ford, a Democrat, told CNN late Wednesday that the state was prepared to rebuff the Trump campaign’s offensive. “We think it’s pretty impenetrable when it comes to legal challenge against us,” Mr. Ford said. Tensions are running high in the state. A news briefing by the Clark County registrar, Joe Gloria, on Wednesday afternoon was briefly interrupted by a man who jumped in front of cameras and repeatedly yelled: “The Biden crime family is stealing this election! The media is covering it up!” After the man — who was wearing a tank top that proclaimed, “Barbecue, Beer, Freedom” — was escorted away, Mr. Gloria said his staff had removed an unspecified number of election observers from counting facilities for being disruptive. Few political observers expected Nevada to be a key state in the 2020 presidential race. Four years ago, Hillary Clinton beat Mr. Trump there by 2.4 percentage points, or about 27,000 votes. Democrats had pegged that as the tipping point to her nationwide victory — until she lost several traditionally blue states in the Midwest. Since then, Nevada has turned a deeper shade of blue, with Democrats controlling the governor’s office and legislature, both Senate seats and all but one House seat. It was not widely expected to be a battleground state this year. But while recent polls consistently showed Mr. Biden ahead of President Trump in Nevada, Democrats worried that the pandemic would make it difficult to create a robust election turnout operation. The state has reported more than 104,000 coronavirus cases. — Mike Ives, Jennifer Medina and David L. Phillips PHILADELPHIA — Pennsylvania Democrats are growing increasingly confident that when all the votes are counted, Joseph R. Biden Jr. will have a significant lead of more than 100,000 votes. At a news conference Thursday morning in Philadelphia, Sharif Street, a state senator and vice chair of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, said that the party thinks Mr. Biden could win by as much as 190,000 votes in the state, driven in large part by the number of votes still being counted in Philadelphia. City election officials have not provided an update as to when they will finish counting ballots, but the collar counties around Philadelphia, including Bucks County and Montgomery County, are getting closer to a full count. Workers spent the night tallying a backlog of more than one million absentee and mail-in votes, and state officials said they expected a clearer picture to emerge with the release of more results. Mr. Biden trailed Mr. Trump by about 115,000 votes as of 12:30 p.m. Eastern on Thursday.   Winning Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes would clinch the election for Mr. Biden, who used his Scranton roots in an appeal to win back the once-blue state that broke for Mr. Trump in 2016. Mr. Trump has aggressively challenged voting procedures in the state and is suing to halt the counting of ballots that were cast before the deadline, among other legal challenges. Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, condemned the legal maneuvers. “Our election officials at the state and local level should be free to do their jobs without intimidation or attacks,” Mr. Wolf said in a statement. “These attempts to subvert the democratic process are disgraceful.” Mr. Biden is expected to gain significant ground in Philadelphia and its suburbs, where vote counters were working around the clock to sort through hundreds of thousands of uncounted votes. A number of ballots also remain in more conservative counties, giving the Trump campaign hope. If the race comes down to the wire, the fate of thousands of provisional ballots set to be counted next week might also be in play. Many voters who requested mail-in ballots but decided to vote in person instead and did not bring their mail ballots with them to be “spoiled,” or rendered unusable, were given provisional ballots, said Bethany Hallam, a member of the elections board of Allegheny County. At least one Republican lawsuit was filed to throw out certain provisional ballots, and Ms. Hallam expects more are coming. Mr. Trump “sent his entire legal team to Pennsylvania to try to invalidate legal votes in whatever way possible,” Ms. Hallam said. On Thursday, the Trump campaign held a brief news conference outside the Convention Center, celebrating a court order that allowed for their observers to more closely watch the ballot counting in Philadelphia. City officials quickly filed an appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which resulted in a brief pause in the count in Philadelphia. But it was quickly resumed. The state Supreme Court has not issued a decision as to whether they would accept or deny the appeal. — Nick Corasaniti, Trip Gabriel and Daniel Victor Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has maintained a steady but slightly narrowing lead in Arizona vote tallies after Election Day, with Latino voters lining up behind the former vice president in a state that President Trump won by three and a half percentage points in 2016. As of early Thursday, Mr. Biden led Mr. Trump in Arizona by 68,400 votes, or less than three percentage points. In the votes so far from Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, Mr. Biden leads by five percentage points, with about 5 percent of the total vote still outstanding. More results from the state are expected to be released Thursday night. Even Mr. Biden’s narrow edge underscored a profound political shift in Arizona, a longtime Republican bastion that has lurched left in recent years, fueled by rapidly evolving demographics and a growing contingent of young Latino voters who favor liberal policies. The count was delayed in the early hours of Thursday, as dozens of Trump supporters demonstrated outside the Maricopa County election office where the votes were being counted. In one of the brightest spots for Democrats so far, the former astronaut Mark Kelly defeated the state’s Republican senator, Martha McSally, in a special election, making Mr. Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema the first pair of Democrats to represent Arizona in the Senate since the 1950s. Winning Arizona would give Mr. Biden an additional path to victory that wouldn’t require Pennsylvania, where final results aren’t expected today. If Mr. Biden won Arizona and held on to a tight lead in Nevada, he could lose Pennsylvania and still reach the 270 electoral votes needed for the presidency. — Jennifer Medina and Daniel Victor  As the results rolled in on Tuesday night, a feeing of déjà vu arrived along with them. Pre-election polls, it appeared, had been misleading once again. While the nation awaits final results from Michigan, Pennsylvania and a few other states, it is already clear — no matter who ends up winning — that the industry failed to fully account for the missteps that led it to underestimate President Trump’s support four years ago. The misses raise the question whether the polling industry, which has become a national fixation in an era of data journalism and statistical forecasting, can survive yet another crisis of confidence. “I want to see all the results in,” Christopher Borick, the director of polling at Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania, said in an interview. “I want to see where those deviations are from pre-election polls and final margins. But there’s ample evidence that there were major issues again. Just how deep they are, we’ll see.” In some states where many polls had projected Mr. Trump losing narrowly — like Ohio, Iowa and Florida — he had already been declared the winner by early Wednesday. And in states that had seemed more than likely to go for Mr. Biden, like Michigan and Nevada, results were too close to call as the official tallies trickled in. (In one such state, Wisconsin, Mr. Biden was declared the winner on Wednesday afternoon, by 0.6 percentage points.) Given the ballots that have been counted, it is now clear that there was an overestimation of Mr. Biden’s support across the board, particularly with white voters and with men. And while polling had presaged a swing away from Mr. Trump among white voters 65 and over, that never fully took shape. Partly as a result, Mr. Biden underperformed his expectations not only in polyglot states like Florida but in heavily white, suburban areas such as Macomb County, Mich., where he had been widely expected to do well. Dr. Borick pointed out that while state-level polls had widely misfired in 2016, the same thing had generally not occurred in the 2018 midterm elections. This led him to conclude that Mr. Trump was a complicating factor. “In the end, like so many Trump-related things, there may be different rules,” he said. “I’m a quantifiable type of human being; I want to see evidence. And I only have two elections with Donald Trump in them — but both seem to be behaving in ways that others don’t behave.” Not every pollster fared poorly. Ann Selzer, long considered one of the top pollsters in the country, released a poll with The Des Moines Register days before the election showing Mr. Trump opening up a seven-point lead in Iowa; that appears to be in line with the actual result thus far. And inevitably, Robert Cahaly and his mysterious Trafalgar Group — which projected a bunch of close races in the battlegrounds — will get another look from curious commentators wondering why it has been so close to accurate, both in 2016 and this year. The firm was among the only pollsters to show Mr. Trump’s strength in the Midwest and Pennsylvania four years ago, and while its polls this fall may end up being a little on the rosy-red side, it appears to have gotten the horse race in many states closer than other pollsters, by not giving short shrift to Mr. Trump’s strengths. — Giovanni Russonello While there have been countless election cases filed around the nation, it is not clear which of them might reach the Supreme Court in the coming days. But one candidate is already on the docket, and on Wednesday the Trump campaign said that it was intervening in the case, from Pennsylvania, which challenges a ruling by the state’s highest court that extended the deadline for receiving mail ballots by three days. Last month, the court refused to put the Pennsylvania case on a fast track, but three justices indicated that the court might return to it later if need be. Should the vote in Pennsylvania have the potential to determine the outcome in the Electoral College and should those late-arriving ballots have the potential to swing the state — two big ifs — the U.S. Supreme Court might well intercede. The justices refused a plea from Republicans to fast-track a decision on whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had acted lawfully when it ordered a three-day extension for ballots clearly mailed on or before Election Day, and for ballots with missing or illegible postmarks “unless a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that it was mailed after Election Day.” The justices’ refusal came a little more than a week after the court deadlocked, 4 to 4, on an emergency application in the case on Oct. 19. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh said they would have granted a stay blocking the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s decision. On the other side were Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and the court’s three-member liberal wing: Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the court on Oct. 27, did not take part in the decision not to fast-track the case. Justice Alito, joined by Justices Thomas and Gorsuch, criticized his court’s treatment of the matter, which he said had “needlessly created conditions that could lead to serious postelection problems.” “It would be highly desirable to issue a ruling on the constitutionality of the State Supreme Court’s decision before the election,” Justice Alito wrote. “That question has national importance, and there is a strong likelihood that the State Supreme Court decision violates the federal Constitution.” But there was not enough time, he wrote. Still, Justice Alito left little doubt about where he stood on the question in the case. Pennsylvania officials have instructed county election officials to segregate ballots arriving after 8 p.m. on Election Day through 5 p.m. on Friday. That would as a practical matter allow a ruling from the Supreme Court to determine whether they were ultimately counted. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
