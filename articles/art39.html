President Trump has been given the steroid dexamethasone, his physician said on Sunday. A timeline of statements from Trump’s doctors and aides shows conflicting reports over Trump’s condition. Two White House residence employees, who do not have contact with the president, tested positive weeks ago. Pope Francis, denouncing the lack of global solidarity, says the virus exposes “our false securities.” The London Marathon, geographically distanced, is run all over the world. The virus upends South Korea’s Thanksgiving, and other news from around the world. Mike Pompeo cuts visits to South Korea and Mongolia from his Asia trip. President Trump’s medical team acknowledged delivering an overly rosy description of the president’s illness on Saturday. “I didn’t want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction, and in doing so, you know, it came off that we were trying to hide something, which wasn’t necessarily true,” Dr. Sean P. Conley, the White House physician, said in a briefing with reporters Sunday. The doctors said that Mr. Trump had a “high fever” on Friday, and that there had been two incidents when his oxygen levels dropped — one on Friday and one on Saturday. They said Mr. Trump received oxygen at the White House on Friday; they were not clear about whether it was administered again on Saturday. Mr. Trump’s oxygen levels dropped to 93 percent at one point, they said; that is below the 95 percent level that is considered the lower limit of the normal range. Dr. Conley said that the president had been given the steroid dexamethasone on Saturday. The drug has been shown to help patients who are severely ill with Covid-19, but it is typically not used in mild or moderate cases of the disease, and in fact could be harmful early in the course of the illness, when steroids could dampen the body’s immune response to the virus. The World Health Organization issued guidelines on Sept. 2 recommending that the steroid only be given to patients with “severe and critical Covid-19.” The National Institutes of Health has issued similar guidance, specifying that the drug is recommended only for people who require a mechanical ventilator to help them breathe, or who need supplemental oxygen. The N.I.H. panel that issued the guidance went further, explicitly recommending against using steroids in patients who did not require supplemental oxygen. A large study of dexamethasone in Britain found that the drug helped those who had been sick for more than a week, reducing deaths by one-third among patients on mechanical ventilators and by one-fifth among patients receiving supplemental oxygen by other means. Dexamethasone is one of several treatments that the president has been receiving. On Friday, he was given an infusion of an experimental antibody cocktail that is being tested by the drug maker Regeneron. Mr. Trump is also receiving a five-day course of remdesivir, another experimental drug that is used in hospitalized patients and has been granted emergency authorization by the Food and Drug Administration. Regeneron’s antibody cocktail and remdesivir are treatments that are believed to work best early in the course of the infection, because they fight the virus itself and could prevent it from spreading throughout the body. But dexamethasone, which reduces the body’s immune response, is given later in the illness, when some people’s immune systems go into overdrive and attack their vital organs. Even though he has had low-oxygen episodes and is receiving dexamethasone, the doctors said Mr. Trump was doing better and might be discharged from the hospital and return to the White House as early as Monday. The briefing came a day after a messy and contradictory presentation on Friday about whether Mr. Trump had serious medical issues. — Maggie Haberman and Katie Thomas The White House has not sought help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to trace the contacts of people who attended a celebration in the Rose Garden on Sept. 26 for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, according to a federal official familiar with the matter. Dr. Sean Conley, the White House physician, told reporters on Saturday that his team was working with the agency to trace contacts. But according to the federal official, while the C.D.C. had a team of experts on standby to help the White House, it has not been approached to do so. In an interview Sunday on the CBS program “Face the Nation,” Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, also offered evidence suggesting that no robust contact tracing effort was underway. Dr. Gottlieb said he had spoken to several officials who attended the Rose Garden event and who had not been spoken to by any contact tracers. “I think they have an obligation to understand how the infection was introduced into that environment,” he said of the White House. “There doesn’t seem to be a very concerted effort underway.” The celebration of Judge Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court on Saturday is looking more and more like a “super spreader event.” At least seven attendees, including President Trump and Melania Trump, have already tested positive. Some attendees have since tested negative, but that does not necessarily mean they are not infected. Negative results are common early in the course of infection, when the levels of virus in the body are still low. For that reason, C.D.C. guidelines recommend that anyone who has been in close contact with an infected person should stay in quarantine for two weeks even if they test negative. Since a Sept. 26 celebration for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, at least seven attendees have tested positive for the virus. The lack of attention to contact tracing could have devastating consequences for the hundreds of people who have come into proximity with those who may have become infected on Saturday. Any of them could have caught the virus and gone on to transmit it to many more people. Since Saturday, President Trump has debated former Vice President Joe Biden, spoken at a rally attended by thousands of people in Minnesota, met with supporters at a golf club in New Jersey and conferred with dozens of aides at the White House, all while not wearing a mask. Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey who helped the president prepare for Tuesday’s debate, has tested positive and been hospitalized. The C.D.C. has experts who are trained in contact tracing and could have immediately put an operation into place to trace contacts of President Trump and others who have been infected. The experts would have worked with health departments of the states in which incidents occurred. In the case of the White House, “we would help if we were asked,” the official said. But no such request came through, he said: “We don’t get involved unless we’re asked to get involved.” A visual guide to the president’s movements and contacts in the days before he announced his positive test for the coronavirus. — Apoorva Mandavilli Since the moment shortly before 1 a.m. on Friday when President Trump first revealed to the nation that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, conflicting information offered by his doctors and aides has added confusion to an already anxious moment, leaving Americans to wonder whether the president’s condition was improving or was “very concerning.” On Sunday, Mr. Trump’s medical team clarified that they had given an overly rosy description of the president’s illness on Saturday. But it remained unclear exactly when his illness had been diagnosed, when he had first developed symptoms, how severe those symptoms were and whether he had been treated with oxygen at any point. Here is a timeline of information released before Sunday on Mr. Trump’s health: Early Saturday, in the first official briefing by Mr. Trump’s doctors since he fell ill, the White House physician, Sean P. Conley, painted a relentlessly positive assessment of Mr. Trump’s condition. “The team and I are extremely happy with the progress the president has made,” Dr. Conley said then. His tone was a bit more guarded in the latest update. Dr. Conley said in a statement Saturday night that while the president is “not yet out of the woods, the team remains cautiously optimistic.” Dr. Conley and others on the team declined to provide important specifics, and left an impression that the president had been known to be sick a day earlier than previously reported, forcing them to backtrack later. At the morning briefing, Dr. Conley said that the president was not receiving supplemental oxygen at that time, but he repeatedly declined to say definitively whether Mr. Trump had ever been on oxygen. “None at this moment, and yesterday with the team, while we were all here, he was not on oxygen,” Dr. Conley said, leaving open whether there had been a period on Friday when he was on oxygen. Two people close to the White House said in separate interviews with The New York Times that the president had experienced trouble breathing on Friday and that his blood oxygen level had dropped, prompting his doctors to give him supplemental oxygen at the White House and then to transfer him to Walter Reed. Dr. Conley also appeared to indicate that the president’s infection was first diagnosed on Wednesday, and not on Thursday night, as Mr. Trump had said when he disclosed the positive test on Twitter early Friday. As Dr. Conley was describing what he said was the president’s progress, he said that Mr. Trump was “just 72 hours into the diagnosis now,” which would have put the diagnosis at midday on Wednesday. After the early briefing on Saturday, Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, offered a far more sobering assessment of the president’s condition than the doctors had. Speaking to reporters outside Walter Reed, Mr. Meadows described the president’s vital signs as “very concerning.” “We’re still not on a clear path to a full recovery,” he said. Mr. Meadows, whose comments were said to have angered the president, later called to Fox News and said that Mr. Trump had shown “unbelievable improvement.” Mr. Trump was said by three administration officials and people close to him to indeed be in better shape, which added to the frustration among some White House advisers that Dr. Conley and Mr. Meadows had created such confusion. — Peter Baker, Maggie Haberman and Marc Santora Two members of the White House residence staff tested positive for the coronavirus roughly three weeks ago, according to two people familiar with the diagnoses. The people who tested positive were not employees who come in direct contact with the president and the first lady, one of the people familiar with the diagnoses said. But the positive results again raise questions about how and when President Trump may have been exposed to the virus. Judd Deere, a spokesman for the president, declined to comment specifically on the diagnoses, referring to a statement about not commenting on the personal health of individuals. The White House “does take any positive case seriously and has extensive plans and procedures in place to prevent further spread,” he said. “A full and complete contact trace consistent with C.D.C. guidelines is included in that and appropriate notifications and recommendations are made. “ — Maggie Haberman Pope Francis criticized the failures of global cooperation in response to the coronavirus pandemic in a document released on Sunday that underscores the priorities of his pontificate. “As I was writing this letter, the Covid-19 pandemic unexpectedly erupted, exposing our false securities,” Francis said in the encyclical, the most authoritative form of papal teaching. “Aside from the different ways that various countries responded to the crisis, their inability to work together became quite evident. For all our hyper-connectivity, we witnessed a fragmentation that made it more difficult to resolve problems that affect us all,” he added. “Anyone who thinks that the only lesson to be learned was the need to improve what we were already doing, or to refine existing systems and regulations, is denying reality,” the pope said. Released amid another Vatican financial scandal and after changes in church rules regarding sex abuse, the letter steered clear of other contentious subjects. It instead returned often to some of the church’s hobbyhorses, including a secularism that has produced what the church sees as a throwaway, consumerist culture. Francis argued that this was apparent in the treatment of older people during the pandemic. “If only we might keep in mind all those elderly persons who died for lack of respirators, partly as a result of the dismantling, year after year, of health care systems. If only this immense sorrow may not prove useless, but enable us to take a step forward toward a new style of life,” he wrote. The pope also warned that the forces of “myopic, extremist, resentful and aggressive nationalism are on the rise.” — Jason Horowitz On Sunday, more than 40,000 people were expected to run the London Marathon — just not together. Instead, runners were scattered across Britain and more than 100 other countries, after organizers encouraged the vast majority of participants to run 26.2 miles at a time that worked for them wherever they happened to be. Those who took part in the geographically distanced race were told to log their performances on a dedicated app to claim their medals and official T-shirts. The official course in St. James’s Park in central London — 19 laps of 1.3 miles each, plus an additional 1,470 yards  — was restricted to a relative handful of elite runners. The race, which was postponed from April, is one of the only major marathons to be maintained in any form this year. Brigid Kosgei of Kenya, who won the 2019 edition and is the current world-record holder in the women’s marathon, defended her title on Sunday, finishing in 2 hours 18 minutes 58 seconds. Kosgei, 26, told the BBC that while it was “wonderful to race,” her preparation had been affected by the pandemic. “I struggled up to the moment I finished,” she said. In the men’s race, the Ethiopian runner Shura Kitata, 24, won in a sprint finish, crossing the line in 2:05.41, a second before Vincent Kipchumba of Kenya. World-record holder Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya, who has won the London Marathon four times, came in eighth. Prince Harry said Saturday in a message published by the race’s organizers that “the amazing tenacity of runners from around the world is a reminder of our strength and sense of community during these difficult times.” — Elian Peltier In a normal year, millions of people in South Korea would be spending this weekend visiting family in their hometowns in celebration of Chuseok, the rough Korean equivalent of Thanksgiving. But this year, the government has asked South Koreans to stay home, to avoid exacerbating the country’s latest coronavirus outbreak. Many South Koreans have grudgingly followed orders, but their acquiescence comes with an emotional price: A normally joyful time of year now feels empty of its sacred rituals, and clouded with feelings of anxiety and disorientation. “Watching my parents grow older and change often worries me, but seeing them in person puts my mind at ease again,” said Joo Jae-wook, 57, a retired salesman who has traveled with his brothers to their hometown every Chuseok for the past three decades. “But this year I can’t even do that.” South Korea, a nation of about 50 million, has reported 421 deaths and more than 24,000 coronavirus infections since the pandemic began, including almost 500 new cases in the past week. The country’s response has been widely praised as a model, but a recent outbreak that began in Seoul has tested the government’s strategy of using social-distancing restrictions and extensive tracking to keep the virus at bay without shutting down the economy. Last week, President Moon Jae-in told the nation that South Korea’s people were observing Chuseok at a “difficult time,” and that their sacrifices would be rewarded. “The government will surely repay the people who have endured the difficulties by succeeding in controlling the virus and protecting the economy,” he said.  In other global developments: The United Kingdom reported a record 12,871 new cases on Saturday evening, double the number daily infections from Friday. The nation is working to contain a second coronavirus wave, and the government said the spike was the result of a “technical issue” that delayed the publication of some cases. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday that the situation would be “bumpy” until Christmas and potentially longer. Britons, he added, should behave “fearlessly, but with common sense.” France reported some 17,000 new cases of infection on Saturday as an ongoing surge in cases forced the closure of bars and restaurants in the southern port of Marseilles. Rising infection rates mean similar closures could soon apply in the capital, Paris. Poland’s government said the country surpassed 100,000 total cases on Sunday for the first time. Russia on Sunday recorded more than 10,000 new infections for the first time since mid-May during the outbreak’s peak there, reporting 10,499 cases. President Vladimir V. Putin, who encouraged his country to return to normal, has built himself a virus-free bubble that far outstrips the protective measures taken by many of his foreign counterparts. India on Sunday reported 75,829 new infections and 940 deaths, a day after it became the third country after the United States and Brazil to pass 100,000 deaths. Israelis opposed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his handling of the pandemic protested across the country on Saturday night, despite new restrictions on public assembly, Agence France-Presse reported. In Tel Aviv, the capital, demonstrators staged several simultaneous marches in different parts of the city, an A.F.P. photographer there said. The police did not give an estimate on the number of protesters. In Jerusalem, the Israeli news media estimated that about 200 people were protesting outside Mr. Netanyahu’s official residence, a marked contrast with the thousands who were there a week earlier. Parliament on Wednesday approved a law restricting demonstrations as part of a coronavirus-related state of emergency, which critics say is aimed at silencing demonstrations against Mr. Netanyahu. — Jun Michael Park and Mike Ives As campuses across the United States struggle to carry on amid Covid-19 illnesses and outbreaks, a determined minority are beating the pandemic — at least for the moment — by holding infections to a minimum and allowing students to continue living in dorms and attend in-person classes. Being located in small towns, having minimal fraternity and sorority life, and aggressively enforcing social-distancing measures all help in suppressing the contagion, experts say. But one major thread connects the most successful campuses: extensive testing. Small colleges in New England — where the Broad Institute, a large academic laboratory affiliated with M.I.T. and Harvard, is supporting a regional testing and screening program with more than 100 colleges — are showing particularly low rates of infection. The partnership tests students frequently and pays $25 to $30 per test to have the samples processed overnight at the institute’s lab in Cambridge, Mass. The program has allowed Colby College, with about 2,000 students on its rural Maine campus, to test each student before and after arrival on campus, then twice weekly thereafter, using a nasal swab PCR test that takes less than three minutes to conduct. Faculty and staff members are also tested twice weekly. So far, the campus has had 11 positive tests, a few of which turned out to be false positives, said David Greene, the school’s president. In one case, the testing identified a student who had apparently caught the coronavirus on the way to campus and did not have a sufficient viral load to test positively upon entry, he said. By the time the infection was caught in the next round of testing two days later, contact tracing revealed that a roommate had been infected. “It could have been 150 people, and we kept it to one person,” Mr. Greene said. Large outbreaks expanded on campuses as new semesters were underway. — Shawn Hubler As President Trump remains hospitalized with Covid-19, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will cut short a trip to Asia this week, canceling stops in South Korea and Mongolia but continuing with a visit to Japan. From Sunday through Tuesday he will be in Tokyo, where he will participate in a meeting of foreign ministers from Australia, India and Japan to discuss the pandemic and other issues. “Secretary Pompeo expects to be traveling to Asia again in October and will work to reschedule visits on that trip, that is now just a few weeks off,” a State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said in a brief written statement Saturday. She did not specify why the schedule had been changed. Mr. Pompeo earlier alluded to the possibility of curtailing his Asia visit because of the novel coronavirus infections in the president’s circle. “If we can’t — if have to postpone a trip or cancel something, we’ll figure out how to get it back on the schedule,” he told reporters on Friday. “But I’m hopeful we can at least make sure we get to Asia for sure — some important things, but we’ll see. If the medical situation doesn’t permit it, we won’t do that. We won’t put anybody at risk.” Mr. Pompeo said that he had tested negative on Friday and had last met with Mr. Trump on Sept. 15. — Austin Ramzy New York reopened classrooms for hundreds of thousands of students last week, after a tumultuous summer of last-minute changes. But the city’s ambitious plan to randomly test students for the coronavirus in each of its 1,800 public schools will probably be insufficient to catch outbreaks before they spread beyond a handful of students, according to new estimates of the spread of infections in city schools. The city plans to test a random sample of 10 to 20 percent of people, including students and adults, in each city school once a month starting next week, already a herculean task. But in order to reliably detect outbreaks and prevent them from spinning out of control, New York may need to test about half of the students at each school twice a month, researchers at New York University estimated. Experiences in Germany, Israel and other countries suggest that outbreaks could spread quickly despite the city’s relatively low rate of infection, the researchers said. “The outbreaks could be quite large by the time they are detected by the monthly, 10-to-20-percent testing,” said Anna Bershteyn, the lead author of the new analysis and assistant professor of population health at N.Y.U. The testing issue took on fresh urgency this week, when Mayor Bill de Blasio reported that the city’s average test positivity rate, which has been extremely low throughout the summer, had begun to tick up. If the virus continues to surge, the entire public school system could shutter. The finding underscores how daunting testing will be in any district trying to reopen for some in-person classes, and particularly in New York, which is home to a system of 1.1 million students, about half of whom returned to classrooms this week. — Benedict Carey, James Glanz and Eliza Shapiro The N.F.L. postponed a highly anticipated game scheduled for Sunday between the New England Patriots and the Kansas City Chiefs until Monday or Tuesday after positive coronavirus tests on both teams. According to multiple reports, Cam Newton, the Patriots quarterback, was among those who tested positive. The Patriots confirmed a positive test but did not identify the player. In a statement released Saturday, the team said the player entered isolation and that subsequent testing on players and staff members who had been in contact with him had come back negative. The new positive tests come after the N.F.L. spent much of the week scrambling to address an outbreak of positive tests among the Tennessee Titans. That team reported 11 positive tests among players and team personnel, which forced the league to push its scheduled Week 4 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers back to Oct. 25, Week 7 of the football calendar. In a statement, the league said that the Patriots and the Chiefs were consulting with infectious disease experts and working closely with the N.F.L. and the players’ association “to evaluate multiple close contacts, perform additional testing and monitor developments.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
