The first day of early voting drew Milwaukee voters out on an unseasonably cool day. Florida sees a record early vote, with Democrats casting more mail-in ballots than Republicans. A poll finds Trump and Biden tied in Georgia, and Democrats gaining in Senate races. ‘No more business as usual’: Democrats weigh boycott of committee vote on Judge Barrett. Pennsylvania, where Trump will campaign Tuesday, has been battered by the coronavirus. Melania Trump, who had the coronavirus, cancels a campaign appearance because of a lingering cough. MILWAUKEE — Despite the unseasonably cool 35-degree temperature, lines were already snaking around two sides of the Frank P. Zeidler Municipal Building in downtown Milwaukee by 7:30 a.m., as crowds waited for more than two hours to cast their ballots on the first day of early voting in Wisconsin. Jon Berlin, 70, a psychiatrist, arrived with his partner, Susan Hrlevich, 60, at 5:20 a.m. The pair, who are independent voters, wore parkas and brought folding canvas chairs as they walked from their downtown residence to cast votes for Joseph R. Biden Jr. They said they feared even longer lines — and exposure to the coronavirus — if they had waited until Nov. 3 to vote. “I don’t feel safe in this country for the first time,” said Mr. Berlin. “We have this horrible pandemic and we need a leader who can face the truth and tell the truth.” Early voting has drawn crowds around the nation, and both campaigns are seeking to turn out their supporters. Senator Kamala Harris of California, Mr. Biden’s running mate, planned to participate in a virtual Milwaukee rally with Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and several local officials to encourage early voting there. Chrystal Gillon-Mabry, a 68-year-old artist, and her sister, Coral Hegwood, 59, a retired city employee, brought books to read and chairs when they arrived before 5:30 a.m. Ms. Hegwood said that she was still undecided as she stood in line. “I don’t want to vote for Trump, but I don’t want to compromise my Christian beliefs,” she said. Afterward, she said she had voted for Mr. Biden. “I prayed and prayed on it,” she said, concluding that “Biden has more compassion than Trump — he has no compassion or empathy for anybody.” Before in-person early voting began Tuesday, more than 915,000 Wisconsinites had voted since officials began mailing absentee ballots Sept. 17, a figure that amounts to about 30 percent of the state’s total vote in 2016. The turnout has been far higher in the state’s traditionally Democratic strongholds. Dane County, which includes Madison and is by far the state’s most Democratic county, has had turnout already that amounts to close to half the votes cast there four years ago. No other county’s turnout eclipsed more than 37 percent of its 2016 numbers. While Wisconsin Democrats have encouraged voters to cast ballots as soon as they are able, the state’s Republican Party urged supporters to wait until early voting began. “Avoid the long lines on Election Day,” read a flyer the Republican Party of Wisconsin mailed to supporters last week, urging them to make plans to vote early, which the state describes as voting “absentee” in person. The mailing made no mention of voting by mail. Denise Williams, 67, who uses a walker and has been staying mostly at home since the pandemic, was glad to socialize — from at least a few feet apart — with fellow voters, all of whom wore masks. She arrived at 6 a.m. and waited almost three hours. “Our country is too divided, I want it back together again,” said Ms. Williams, a retired nursing assistant who voted for Mr. Biden. She would have voted by mail, she said, but she never received a ballot. “I wanted to make sure my vote got in, and with my health, I don’t know how I’ll be on Election Day.” — Kay Nolan and Reid J. Epstein THE EARLY VOTE When early voting began in Florida on Monday, 366,436, Floridians went to the polls and cast ballots in person, according to data collected by the United States Elections Project. The total eclipsed the record set on the first day of early, in-person voting four years ago, when about 291,000 people cast ballots, according to The Miami Herald. Including mailed-in ballots, more than three million people have now voted so far this year in Florida. That’s more than 30 percent of all the votes cast in the state in the entire 2016 election, data shows. Both parties, and campaigns up and down the ballot, are trying to figure out whether the big early numbers are likely to translate into record turnout or simply indicate that people are voting earlier than usual because of coronavirus fears and mail delays. The early data, collected by Michael P. McDonald, a professor of political science at the University of Florida, shows that registered Democrats in Florida have been far more likely to vote by mail than Republicans, suggesting that President Trump’s frequent broadsides against voting by mail may have resonated with Republicans. “This is a dynamic we’re seeing elsewhere, too,” Dr. McDonald said in an interview. But Republicans nearly tied Democrats when it came to casting ballots in person on the first day of early voting. Here is what the Florida data showed, as of Tuesday evening: 3,033,702 Floridians have already voted. Turnout is already 31.7 percent of what it was in the entire 2016 election. 366,436 people had voted in person, including 154,004 Democrats and 153,743 Republicans. 2,667,266 people had voted by mail, including 1,293,994 Democrats and 812,363 Republicans. Democrats have requested 802,576 more mail-in ballots than Republicans. — Michael Cooper President Trump abruptly cut off an interview with the “60 Minutes” star Lesley Stahl at the White House on Tuesday and then taunted her on Twitter, posting a short behind-the-scenes video of her at the taping and noting that she had not been wearing a mask. The bizarre events occurred after Mr. Trump had grown irritated with Ms. Stahl’s lines of questioning, according to two people familiar with the circumstances of the taping. One person briefed on what took place said that Mr. Trump had spent more than 45 minutes filming with Ms. Stahl and her CBS News crew, and that the taping had not wrapped up when the president’s aides had expected it to. So Mr. Trump cut the interview short, and then refused to participate in a “walk and talk” segment with Ms. Stahl and Vice President Mike Pence, the people said. Shortly afterward, Mr. Trump posted a six-second video clip on his Twitter account that appeared to show Ms. Stahl at the White House after the interview abruptly ended. “Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes not wearing a mask in the White House after her interview with me,” Mr. Trump wrote, adding, “Much more to come.” Ms. Stahl has interviewed Mr. Trump twice since the 2016 election, including his first televised interview after winning the presidency. She also filmed with Mr. Trump at the White House in October 2018. Ms. Stahl was hospitalized with the coronavirus in the spring and has since recovered. The president and Mr. Pence were participating in a “60 Minutes” episode set to air on Sunday. The episode is also expected to feature interviews with Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California. Mr. Biden taped his interview with the “CBS Evening News” anchor Norah O’Donnell on Monday. He has not yet tweeted about it. — Michael M. Grynbaum and Maggie Haberman A federal civil rights lawsuit against Mississippi’s top election official was withdrawn on Tuesday after the state agreed to expand curbside voting options in response to the coronavirus pandemic and to give voters the opportunity to fix absentee ballots that are rejected. The state will now allow voters with symptoms of Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, or who have been exposed to someone with the virus, to vote curbside on Election Day. Mississippi must also now notify residents within one business day if their absentee ballots are rejected and give them up to 10 days after the election to correct the problem. Voters previously had no way of knowing that their ballots had been rejected, which critics said was quite common because of the state’s flawed system of matching signatures on the ballots with those on file. The changes came after the N.A.A.C.P., the League of Women Voters in Mississippi and several other plaintiffs sued the secretary of state, Michael D. Watson Jr., a Republican, in August over the state’s election rules, which they asserted would prevent many residents from exercising their right to vote. “Just because a record number of voters in Mississippi will vote by mail this year does not mean there needs to be a record number of disenfranchised voters,” Jennifer Nwachukwu, a counsel for the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in statement. The civil rights groups who filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Mississippi advised voters who cast their ballots by mail to include their phone numbers and email addresses so election officials can contact them if there is a problem. — Neil Vigdor More than two decades of scandals and blunders have made Florida the nation’s elections punchline, the state that kept the world at the edge of its seat while votes for president were manually recounted.
