I’m Ross Douthat, and this is “The Argument.” According to Bob Woodward, Donald Trump knowingly misled the public about the coronavirus in February, when it really mattered. How much blame does the president bear for the 200,000 and counting American lives lost to the virus? Then opinion writer-at-large Charlie Warzel joins us for a debate about the conspiracy turned political movement QAnon. What do QAnoners believe, and how seriously should we take them? Last week, Bob Woodward’s new book Rage quoted President Trump describing Covid-19 as airborne and deadly stuff in early February, at a time when his public denial about the virus still had weeks to run. This revelation followed the previous week’s fury over anonymous reports that Trump had sneered at the American war dead during a World War I commemoration. And there’s good reason to think we’ll have more of this as November nears — leaks and revelations about the president that seem to be saved up for the election homestretch. Michelle, we’ll get to the election in a minute, but I want to start with a counterfactual debate. What do you think would have happened if Trump had said publicly about Covid what he was saying to Woodward in February? Well, I think you would have had much less of a Republican anti-masking movement. You would have had much less of this sense that sort of defying social distancing regulations is a mark not just of conservatism, but really a mark of fealty to the president. We had this really dark moment when Herman Cain, the former Republican presidential candidate, died of Covid shortly after appearing unmasked at a Trump rally. And then his Twitter account, which somebody continues to maintain posthumously, was still tweeting out about how the danger of Covid is overrated. And I don’t think that you would have that sort of mentality, which is often taken as a sign of loyalty to the president and his movement. It just wouldn’t be. I think that if from the beginning, Trump had said this is extraordinarily dangerous and made masking part of his iconography, you would have conservatives adopt that. Trump followers have proven themselves pretty ideologically flexible in sort of jettisoning previously strongly-held beliefs, like Vladimir Putin is bad, the United States should not be part of an axis of murderous autocrats when they get a signal from the president. And I don’t think there was a lot of ideological freight attached previously to pandemic preparedness and warding off disease. So I think the movement would have shifted pretty easily behind him. So just to step back and give listeners a little context, I wrote a either incredibly badly-timed or incredibly well-timed, depending on your point of view, column just before the Woodward revelations came out where I argued that while Trump’s response to the coronavirus has been sort of transparently catastrophic, flailing, you know, whatever pejorative you want to use, it’s not totally clear that that flailing is actually the big reason why the U.S. has 200,000 deaths. And lots of people didn’t agree with that argument, to say the least. But I want to drill into what you just said, and then you can go back to telling me why I’m being silly. So when Trump has this interview with Woodward, it’s early to mid-February. And at that point, the sort of official scientific view is skeptical of masking. You have sort of formal recommendations from public health authorities saying that people shouldn’t wear masks, that masks aren’t effective against the virus. And it’s not clear how much of that is based on science and how much of it was kind of political strategy to prevent people from stockpiling masks because we didn’t have enough masks. But at the same time, you have sort of a run of public statements and commentary, including in our newspaper, arguing that people are being too fearful about the virus, that this is xenophobia and it’s going to encourage hostility to Asian people and hostility to immigrants and so on, right? But I don’t think they were saying that people are being too fearful about the virus. They were saying that there was no reason to direct that fear towards Asian-Americans or towards kind of American Chinatowns, right? That it was not more dangerous to go to Chinatown than it was to go to, at that point, to any other kind of crowded place with a lot of restaurants. And I don’t think we’ve seen any evidence that it was. I think you had some New York politicians and public leaders saying versions of that, but you also had people, like the head of the W.H.O, saying things like, xenophobia is right now more dangerous than the virus. Like, that was sort of a rhetorical trope that was in the air. And I guess I believe two things about this Trump and Woodward stuff. First, Trump absolutely should have been saying what he said to Woodward in public. And had he said it in public and certainly not taken the four weeks of wheel-spinning denial that followed, that the U.S. would probably be in some kind of better shape. At the same time, I also think if Trump had gone all in on masks, shutdowns, social distancing at that moment in mid-February, it would have prompted at least a mild and hopefully temporary liberal backlash where it was seen as Trump grabbing power and hyping a threat to help his re-election and feed xenophobia. And to me, the biggest question for the first wave of the coronavirus was what would have helped New York shut down a week sooner than it did, right? Because so many cases in the U.S. came in through New York. That became the epicenter of our first wave. And it’s just not totally clear to me that Bill de Blasio and Andrew Cuomo would have been encouraged to be more vigorous about shutting down the city if it was seen as a Trump policy. Do you think that’s wrong? You know, I think that might be true, but I just don’t think that you can reduce the American response to this calamity to those decisions. And it also seems strange to me to say, well, scientists got it wrong in February, when the data and what we know about this virus was still kind of quickly shifting and evolving, and kind of compare that to Trump, who has deliberately misled people once the data has come into much clearer focus, right? It’s true that people made mistakes, particularly around masking, that were really bad. But then they corrected them as new information came in, and that is sort of how you expect science to work. What Trump did is the opposite. He had secretly correct information and has spread and continues to spread falsehoods. So to me, those two things are not equivalent. Again, I’m not trying to make an argument for moral equivalence between Trump and anyone. I’m just curious about, I mean, literally what we think the effect on lives lost or saved would have been in that first wave. I mean, there’s also the problem of we were blind in this period because of failures specific to the C.D.C. that a better president than Trump might have done something about, but I think most presidents would have probably failed to do something about, where the C.D.C had all these testing foul-ups and we just didn’t know — Well, I don’t think you can — wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you can’t divorce the C.D.C. from Trump, right? The head of the C.D.C. is somebody that Trump installed there, that another president would not have put there. I think, from everything I’ve read, the choices that the C.D.C. made were characteristic bureaucratic turf-protection choices following standard practices at a moment when standard practices weren’t appropriate. I don’t think they were particularly Trumpy. I think that, again, a president who was super engaged in the issue, who was rising to the challenge would have been on the phone to the C.D.C. head every single day saying, what the hell is going on. You don’t think that there’s a consensus that Redfield has been sort of disastrous as the head of the C.D.C.? I don’t think Redfield’s done a good job, but I think that three-week failure from the C.D.C. was a failure of a Trump appointee being incompetent. I think it was a failure of a federal bureaucracy behaving the way bureaucracies do when they need to pivot and can’t because that’s not how they’re usually prepared to handle things. I don’t know. To me, that’s a kind of unfalsifiable question, right? Of whether if you had a better head of the C.D.C., the C.D.C. would have performed better. Right. I think that there is a counterfactual world in which a much better president than Donald Trump really successfully suppressed the virus. Anyway, let’s pivot quickly just to the election for a minute before we break because I think, as I said at the outset, one of the things that’s interesting about this is there was sort of a mini debate about whether Woodward had an obligation to publicize this when Trump said it, on the theory that publicizing this in February could have saved more lives and Woodward had some kind of obligation. And then there is a larger issue where the story of the week before, the story of Trump defaming the U.S. Dead, was a story that was basically 18 months or two years old and had clearly been sort of saved to be leaked by probably some military figures during the election. So I guess I’m curious what you think about the specific, should Woodward have brought this out earlier, but also what I imagine will be a continuing pattern of things Trump has said or done that are sort of saved up by his internal critics to be revealed in the homestretch of the election. I mean, I hope there’s a lot of those things, you know? I think that some of these Woodward revelations seem, unlike most revelations, to have mattered a bit. You can look at polling that shows people took them seriously. There was one Yahoo poll that showed even I think 15 percent of Trump supporters saying that they were influenced by these revelations about what Trump had said about the virus. It’s hard for me to say whether Woodward should have released them in February, in part because in February, I don’t think it was entirely clear how far Trump’s denialism was going to go, how far his administration’s interference with the scientific-based response was going to go, and also because he would have then shut down the possibility of being able to do all of these other interviews, which yielded important information. So I don’t know that him releasing this in February would have changed it. You know, I think it’s important that it’s out now, at a moment when people are able to really focus on the president’s response and make a decision about it. I have less sympathy for some of the people in Woodward’s book who had their own warnings about Trump that they have kept silent about. You know, Mattis spoke out about that grotesque photo-op after Trump used the military to clear protesters out of Lafayette Square. But in Woodward’s book, you have not just Mattis, but a lot of people talk about how dangerous and unfit Trump is. There’s some extremely damning quotes from Dan Coats, among others. There’s this passage I’ll read. “Mattis said they still had to consider stepping forward. ‘Jim, what would that be?’ Coats asked. ‘I don’t know,’ Mattis replied, ‘But we can’t let the country keep going on this course.’ He repeated, ‘this is dangerous.’ ‘Look,’ Coats said. ‘Others have tried it, and it’s had no impact whatsoever. They get tarred and feathered.’” And you know, if you have any kind of loyalty to this country and to its citizenry, you actually should be willing to go out and get tarred and feathered if you believe that you have information about an existential danger to the country. And so it’s just stunning to me, both that Coats still hasn’t come forward, besides kind of coming forward in this book because he’s obviously a source for Woodward, and his reason for not coming forward. His reason for not coming forward, at least in the book, isn’t I need to stay inside and kind of mitigate the damage as much as I can. It’s that I don’t think it’ll work because it hasn’t worked in the past, and so I’m not willing to stick my neck out, right? I mean, it’s just such astonishing cowardice. For all the talk about saving the republic and protecting the republic from Trump, the reality is that the thing that made Jim Mattis quit was a policy difference about pulling troops out of Syria. It often seems to me that these guys have concerns about Trump’s fitness for the job, but their breaking points are policy disagreements that are actually sort of sometimes places where Trump has a reasonable point and some places where — Well, first of all, Trump did not have a reasonable point about the way he pulled out of Syria, even if you think he has a reasonable point about pulling out of Syria. And Dan Coats thinks that Trump is compromised by Russia. That would have been a useful thing for him to mention during impeachment. He was a senator, and he’s complaining about how Republicans in the Senate are just completely failing to hold this president accountable. Again, that would have been a useful thing for him to say during impeachment. Yeah, I mean, I broadly agree with you. I think people who think that Trump is unfit for the job who worked for him should not be leaking anonymously to Jeffrey Goldberg. They should just be saying what they think, although Mattis did give his own interview to Jeffrey Goldberg that did say some reasonably — Well, and it wasn’t just the interview, right? He had the interview and then the statement. Right, right. But I just think they should all be out there much more publicly. There’s such a huge gap between the degree of alarm that they express in this book and the actions that they’ve taken in response. Yeah, and I think this sense that they have of futility, that people leave the Trump administration and speak out and it doesn’t matter because partisan polarization is so strong, I mean, that may be right as a sort of political— But it’s also self-fulfilling. Well, and it’s punditry, right? They’re sort of doing punditry. And I have plenty of respect for punditry. I’m doing it right now. But this was true during the 2016 campaign, right? When you had all of these Republicans saying, well, I can’t attack Trump too frontally because he’s benefiting from having the establishment against him. You know, you don’t know what’s going to happen. You shouldn’t play punditry about your views as a public figure engaged in a public debate. You should state those views and let the chips fall where they may. All right, I think that’s a good place to break. We’ll be right back [MUSIC PLAYING] And we’re back. Longtime “Argument” listeners will recognize our guest for today’s second segment, Charlie Warzel, the opinion section’s writer-at-large who covers technology, media and politics. Charlie, welcome back to the show. Thanks for having me. You’re very welcome. Your home base — in spite of the at-large title, you actually do have a home base — is usually Montana, but I know you’re in the Pacific Northwest right now. Can you tell us what color the sky is outside your window? It’s a wonderful mixture of fog and smoke, which has just created a full five-feet-away gray wall. But that is actually, interestingly enough, an improvement from the — Yeah, that sounds like an improvement from apocalyptic orange. Yeah, it’s better than the tobacco-stained yellow kind of thing. But still, when I go outside, regardless of what I do, even if it’s just for a minute or two, it feels like I’ve smoked a cigar. [MICHELLE SHARPLY INHALES] This is day five or six of this, and it’s quite a lot to deal with on top of the rest of 2020’s indignities. Well, we’ve actually invited you on today to talk about something that’s apocalyptic in a somewhat different sense, which is the conspiratorial worldview of QAnon, which has been steadily gaining adherents across the Trump presidency and may even have representation in Congress soon enough. I just want to note for our listeners, because of the nature of this theory, the segment to come will include discussion of pedophilia and the trafficking of minors, which might be upsetting to some listeners. Charlie, we’re going to get to questions that are central to your beat right now about the role of the internet in spreading conspiracy theories and more, but I want to start with the basics. As someone who’s been following this for a while, can you explain to the uninitiated what is QAnon? At heart it is what I’m calling a collaborative fiction. But it is a conspiratorial mass of theories that center around almost a biblical struggle of good versus evil, in which Donald Trump and the Trumpist Republicans are crusading against a true rot in the world. They are trying to purge the deep state of its globalist elite figures, who are consolidating power in order to do absolutely terrible things. And these are things like child sex trafficking. These are things like pagan or satanic rituals in which there is human sacrifice among children, and it gets weirder from there. But the general gist is that the political divide in this world is less ideological than it is a true moral battle of prime good versus extreme evil and that that evil needs to be extinguished. And it is a fight that isn’t just done through policy or legislation. It’s a fight that is done by imprisoning your enemies, by locking them up, by executing them. So I want to go back to the origin point for a minute. The big antecedent to QAnon was Pizzagate, which was the theory that a cabal of Washington DC elites, mostly Democrats — Yep. — were kidnapping children into sex slavery in a ring that was based in the basement of the Comet Ping Pong pizza parlor in Northwest Washington D.C. This was a conspiracy theory that sort of plucked some details from the emails from John Podesta that were leaked by Wikileaks.The narrative of pedophiles in power sort of starts there. And then what “Q” does, who is the anonymous poster who starts this all, he goes online and says, look, I have inside information that everything you think is going on in the Trump era is wrong, that Trump isn’t actually being investigated by Robert Mueller. He is cooperating with Robert Mueller because they’re working together to put these elite pedophiles, as you said, Charlie, in jail. So that’s sort of the pivot that takes us from Pizzagate to Q. Is that right? Yeah, the best way I’ve heard it described as that QAnon is sort of the big-budget sequel to Pizzagate. There was sort of a proof of concept there that it was a very viral, very appealing conspiracy theory to some people, as we saw with the real-world violence and escalation. And so yes, this is sort of a supercharged version of this. But it seems like another antecedent to it QAnon is the “Protocols of the Elders of Zion” and also the kind of classic anti-Semitic blood libel. The “Protocols of the Elders of Zion” is a Russian forgery, which is obviously a theme that’s pretty prevalent in a lot of our modern conspiracy theories. But it’s this Russian forgery that holds that there’s this evil, secret, globalist, Jewish elite who are running things and responsible for all the unrest and disasters in the world. And then there’s also this sort of classic anti-Semitic trope of the blood libel, which is that the evil Jewish cabal is harvesting the blood of Christian children to make their matzah. And this is just a staple of anti-Semitic ideology. It was kind of a staple of Der Stürmer. QAnon just seems to me to be a continuation of these classic anti-Semitic storylines in a slightly different guise, maybe less overtly targeting Jewish people, although they do still have George Soros up there pulling all the strings. I think that’s a great point, and I’m glad you brought it up. It’s very true. QAnon has a great deal of the anti-Semitic tropes to it, especially the Soros-related globalist Rothschild banker elites controlling the world. The blood libel elements of that, I completely agree. As far as ties to Russia, I think it’s worth being very clear that it’s super difficult to divine where this conspiracy is coming from. Oh no, I’m not trying to blame it on Russia. I just am making a point that, you know, Russian forgeries about the ritual murder of children are not a new thing in Western politics. Absolutely. And what’s important to know is that once something like this is out there, regardless of its origin, in terms of who the first Q post was authored by or subsequent posts, these theories are observed by our enemies, and they are weaponized by them and used to sow further division and discord. But I think you’re right in the sense that QAnon is not new, in the sense. But what is new about it is I keep going back to this idea that it is a big-tent conspiracy theory. I mean, they — So is anti-Semitism. Absolutely. At the core of it, people think that the Donald Trump pedophile-remover-in-chief trait is core to this, but you don’t actually have to believe in that to be welcomed by the QAnon community. And that’s what I think is so insidious about it is it’s luring people in through these other methods. So I want to talk about the possible dangers in a minute. I’m curious. Charlie, you just described the core of it as the idea of Donald Trump, anti-pedophile warrior. And I’m looking at the Wikipedia page for QAnon, which has a useful sentence. QAnon is a far-right conspiracy theory alleging that a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles running a global child sex trafficking ring is plotting against Donald Trump, who is battling them, leading to a day of reckoning involving mass arrests, right? That’s a good one-sentence capsule summary. Yeah. And then Wikipedia is careful to say, no part of the theory is based on fact. That’s an interesting sentence because I think one question that I always have about conspiracy theories is, you know, do real-world events matter to them or not? Because I could tell you a story where QAnon is a kind of elaborate fiction that is being constructed around and validated by a lot of real-world events, right? You know, the story of the last 20 years has been one of sort of cascading revelations starting within literally my own religion, the Roman Catholic Church, continuing through the Harvey Weinstein moment, the Hollywood pedophile reckoning down through Jeffrey Epstein that, in fact, there are networks of pedophiles and sort of generally sexually-exploitative people in positions of power, who in the case of Epstein, have connections to the British royal family, the Clinton family, former Prime Minister of Israel, and so on — And Trump. — and all of that is — and Trump! Oh, right, right. And all of that is real. I’m curious if you think that matters, right? Is the existence of actual pedophile rings, actual networks of exploiters crucial to the appeal of this theory, or is it sort of just an accident of history that we have the Jeffrey Epstein revelations and QAnon gets more popular at the same time? I don’t think it’s a coincidence at all. When Jeffrey Epstein’s arrest and subsequent death in jail was unfolding with all the confusion and mysteries involved — Many of them still unresolved, I want to point out. Many of them still unresolved. I mean, I wrote that this was a super-charging moment for that conspiracy theory and for this in general. And yes, you’re right. We’re living in a time where there are very real conspiracies in plain sight. We’re living in a time when a lot of the quiet part is being said out loud, and I think that that only adds to this. And what’s dangerous and where that line in the Wikipedia page I think is important is that QAnon takes these real conspiracies or these real-life events, and it spins them completely. So the connection of Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, the videos of them at parties together sort of ogling women, when those emerged, rather than the QAnon people starting to say, wow, maybe this is deeper than we thought. Maybe our hero was actually a part of this larger network. Maybe he’s part of the problem, too. It was spun that Donald Trump is a longtime undercover agent who has been working for decades and decades — Right. — infiltrating these networks, cozying up to people like Jeffrey Epstein in order to understand them and in order to destroy them. And look, Jeffrey Epstein was brought to justice. He is dead, and therefore, this is all a part of the plan. Charlie, do you think that part of QAnon could be a coping mechanism for a lot of people? Because one of the things that makes QAnon, it seems to me, different than most other conspiracy theories, and I’ve written about this, is that usually conspiracy theories are about this malevolent power that’s secretly running things, right? And in this case, it’s a conspiracy theory that benevolent powers are working behind the scenes, that there are actually good people in charge of world events, despite all of appearances to the contrary. I can’t think of another conspiracy theory like that. But I wonder if people just have a hard time. I mean, I have a hard time facing the fact to which our country is being ruled by villains and idiots, that no one is in charge. And I think I had a vague sense before all this, even though I consider myself fairly informed about politics, that if things went this far, someone would do something, right? That there was someone who had the sort of power to hold things together and they wouldn’t let things get this out of hand. And I wonder if there are people who think that if this is being allowed to happen, it must be being allowed to happen for a reason. Otherwise, you would have to face the near dissolution of American democracy and kind of the fate of the republic. It’s absolutely a coping mechanism. I look at it a little less, though, as people who are paying strict attention to the politics of the moment, and I think I look at it a little bit more of the people who’ve been left behind by the moment and their government. Even though it started out following the Mueller investigation, I think it’s a coping mechanism for the breakdowns in American life. The best person I’ve talked to about QAnon is actually a video-game designer, and he designs alternate-reality games, which are games that aren’t console video games. They’re games that sort of unfold over a bunch of different media. They set up fake email addresses. They set up fake web pages. They plant things, little clues. It’s almost like a long treasure hunt, clues in newspaper, like print newspaper advertisements, things like that. They’re very popular in the 2000s and 2010s. And this person said that QAnon resembles, to him, an alternate-reality game in that the designers create a framework, and then the people playing get so immersed. They know they’re playing, but they get so immersed that they start to almost rewrite the game. They start to take control of it. They see little gaps and holes that the designers never anticipated, and then they start building it together, which is why I call it a collaborative fiction. I asked him, when do people stop playing the game? And he said, even if you end the game, as the creator, people will still play, as long as it gives them a reason, as long as it gives them a community. And in these games, the main tie is a community that forms, is an accepting group of people, a community that rewards different people’s skills. And QAnon, a lot of that is online research and drawing connections between very vague things. Right. It turns you into someone with a great skill, and you become a truth-seeker. And as these crises overlap on each other — a pandemic with climate-related natural disasters with an election with political polarization — it gets very intense very quickly. There’s a fire burning, and QAnon is a real accelerant. And right now, they think that someone else is in charge, right? Like, right now, they think someone else is going to conduct these mass arrests and executions, if necessary. And so to me, the question is, what happens when Trump is defeated and the prophecy fails? It seems like you’ll have many more people willing to sort of take matters into their own hands, especially if they’re genuinely convinced that the people running the country are harvesting the blood of innocent children. Maybe, although again, this goes to sort of, Charlie, what you were saying about the internet as accelerant, right? But one of the interesting things in my reading on conspiracy theories is that it seems historically, it’s been very possible for people to hold views that if you took them literally would mean that their government was run by the worst human beings imaginable and not have that lead to insane levels of political violence, right? Like, if you read a really good book called “The United States of Paranoia” by a writer named Jesse Walker that I would recommend to people interested in the history of conspiracy theories in U.S. life. And I read it a while ago, but one of the things I took from it is that there is historically usually a gap between what people will sort of commit to believing about the evils in high places and how they will actually act. And I mean, that extends even to sort of recent things like 9/11 trutherism, right? You could get a reasonably large number of people on the political left to assent in polling questions about George W. Bush’s responsibility for 9/11, to assent to views that if you took them literally would mean that the country was run by the most despicable treasonous horror show, right? But there was not actually a major wave of left-wing political violence when George W. Bush won re-election in 2004. And I think historically that’s often been true, that people will say they believe that lizard people are running everything without, in their everyday lives, acting like lizard people are really running everything. I think you’re right that conspiracy theories don’t always lead to mass violence. At the same time, mass violence and genocide is almost always preceded by some sort of conspiracy theories, right? So maybe not every Radio Rwanda is going to end in the Rwandan genocide, but it’s usually, I think, a necessary if not sufficient, precondition. And it’s obviously not the only precondition to mass unrest in this country right now. Yeah, the way that I’m looking at this is these conspiracies are meeting the moment, and the moment is incredibly charged already with violence and with fear and anger and hostility. And that is actually what’s worrying me more is that these theories seem to be hitting harder and sticking with people. And the last thing that I’ve really been noticing is the effect of the pandemic. In the last six months, I have watched again the acceleration of this, and I’m really seeing it in the last month, where it seems like people who kind of held pretty mainstream beliefs have been sucked in or have had these theories court them because they’ve been stuck inside. They’ve had a lot of time. They may have lost their jobs. And it feels like everything is moving a little bit faster, and that, to me, is what’s scary. So I think that that gap between what you’re reading and action is narrowing as the election looms and as all these crises feel more pressing to people. To be reductionist, you’re talking about people being stuck indoors and so on. I mean, this is the first era in human history when everyone is on the internet. To what extent is this the internet? To what extent is this Facebook? There is a sort of ongoing, rolling argument, especially on the left, that Facebook specifically is failing in its responsibility to police conspiracy theories. Do you think that’s right? Well, I do. To take the Facebook point, what I go back to is — I believe it was June, it might have been July of 2017 — Mark Zuckerberg gathered all these community moderators who run Facebook pages and groups in Chicago for the first-ever Facebook Community Summit. And he gave the speech, and it’s about 14, 15 minutes long. And it’s really an amazing document to go back to because he says, we’re going to shift Facebook priorities towards helping you build more meaningful communities. And the way that you do that in the real world is it’s not just you flip through a book and decide to join a book club or go to some knitting group. They’re recommended by friends. They’re recommended by people who know you. It’s networks building on other networks. And he said, so we’re building the best algorithms we can to understand you and recommend you communities based on your interests that will be meaningful to you. And the way in which it’s described, QAnon is proof of a massive success on that front. And then as you tell that story, I mean, is this a Facebook problem, or is it an internet problem, right? Because in 2017, I probably wrote columns like this, right? There was tons of coverage and argument about isolation and alienation and crippling loneliness and personal anxiety as the chief fruits of social media, that people weren’t in communities. They were sort of just alone, performing for a crowd, and maybe being polarized just by the hysteria of their newsfeeds or something. So there is a way in which Zuckerberg is being responsive to what seems like the problem of loneliness and isolation on social media. And the problem is that when you pivot to community, it turns out that the communities that the internet builds are communities of hysterical conspiracy. Then Facebook steps in and breaks up these communities, and then you’re back to the loneliness and anomie problem of social media, right? Right. I mean, it’s an internet problem, for sure. Again, nothing about a lot of these conspiratorial dynamics are new, per se, but the internet supercharges it. The internet allows it to happen at a scale that we’re not used to, that is unprecedented. Facebook has a responsibility here if it’s going to have this primacy in the world, if it’s going to be allowed to operate at such scale. QAnon is a dangerous group, a dangerous community. Yes, it is a community. But it is a community based in a conspiracy theory that never came true, that Hillary Clinton was about to be sent off to Guantanamo Bay for being involved with sex trafficking. And as we’ve talked through here, it is anti-Semitic in nature. It is dangerous in what it asks you to do to fight your political opponents. And I think in a similar way to how Facebook treats other dangerous communities, other extremist communities, it purges them, and it doesn’t necessarily — anymore, at least — think twice about purging a white nationalist community. But we should say that there have been, in the last year, serious Facebook purges of QAnon. The argument is that they have come too late. It’s a little late. I mean, they’re trying now. But again, these networks are dense, and they’re very resilient. So they’ll pop up around new-age wellness, or they’ll rebrand themselves as children — against sex trafficking websites. And they pivot off real-world events, right? Like, if you have something like the Jeffrey Epstein thing and you have a large population commenting on it and theorizing about it, those are, in a sense, conspiracy theories, but they’re also theories that you know a social network that wants to have a reasonable range of debate needs to leave up, right? I mean, again, the power of conspiracy theory is there’s a ton of ambiguity about what constitutes a conspiracy theory and what constitutes commenting on the news of the day. Wait, so this is Ross being QAnon adjacent. How do you know I’m not Q himself? I may be running it. [GOLDBERG LAUGHS] I think it’s totally reasonable to think that it’s dangerous and insane. My question is more like, to what extent is the internet accelerating versus to what extent is the internet sort of exposing patterns of conspiratorial thinking that are common to American history in all times and places that we just didn’t see? I feel like, obviously, fact-checking is sort of completely inadequate to misinformation in this era. Asking the platforms to behave responsibly has not worked. This is maybe a dark response to QAnon and other sorts of internet phenomenon, but I don’t understand — or maybe this has happened. Tell me if this has happened. Why aren’t more people trying to infiltrate these communities? [CHARLIE LAUGHS] It seems like it wouldn’t be that hard to build up a profile in this community and start turning people against each other, start sending people off in different directions. Why isn’t anyone trying to do that? I’m not sure that’s not already happening. While you do see people mobilizing out in the streets and there are some influencer types, a lot of what’s happening in this movement is all just anonymous. I’ve been in some of these groups. There is infighting, right? There is fracture. There is a split. But then those groups go off and form their own node. So I think this is a dynamic situation. It is moving. I think there are people that are going to try to do exactly what you’re saying. How do we know this isn’t how it started, right? What if the original Q was a left-wing operative trying to build up Republican hopes for Donald Trump and then, in theory, make them go insane if he failed? Well, that would be a left-wing operative with a very poor reading of cult history, right? I mean, I feel like that person clearly should have read “When Prophecy Fails” and a whole host of other literature about how people respond to having their conspiracy theories disproven. What’s kind of funny is that you guys are having a conversation that you actually see on some of these terrible message boards and some of these awful threads, which is, to bring it back to the story about the Oregon fires last weekend, there is a photo of a bunch of masked people who look like they were wearing firefighting gear and one of them has a gas canister on their back. And they’re holding an Antifa flag. And all these people are saying, look, see? They’re clearly setting these fires. This is proof. And then someone’s saying, well, actually, the gas can is for the chainsaw there. It’s like, well, that’s what they want you to think, that it’s for the chainsaw. And really, what this is to try to do is to try to make us discredit ourselves. So if we attack them — and it’s just this game of who started the fire. It almost, to some degree, just doesn’t matter. I keep asking these people who are actual researchers and have spent years now tracking QAnon and said, what happens if tomorrow, Q was unmasked, and we figured out who the person was dead to rights. And regardless of who the person is, they don’t think it matters. It’s gone too far. I mean, yes, you’d peel a few people off. Is there any significant body of ex-QAnon people? I mean, you have sort of refugees from all other sorts of cults. It’s starting to happen. A lot of these stories, though, people I’ve been in touch with actually have incredibly traumatic stories because a lot of these people are sex abuse survivors who have longstanding mental health issues who’ve been kind of sucked into the movement and spit out by it and hurt. We don’t quite yet have the very loud poster boy or girl of the movement yet, like a Derek Black or something like that, who has come out of the darkness and seen the light. So I think that’s all coming. This is another part that’s worth mentioning is that this is all still very new. And it’s centrality to politics, talking about Marjorie Taylor Greene, who looks like she’s going to be elected to Congress who fervently believes this, there are other candidates who have these leanings and QAnon support, but she’s going to be the first. So we’re still actually, strangely, in the early days of this, and I think there’s a lot to be determined about where this goes with a potential Joe Biden presidency versus a second Trump term. And honestly, I wouldn’t make a lot of predictions right now. No, no, well, I was just going to say, since we’re coming to the end of our segment, do you want to leave us with a prediction for QAnon and a Biden presidency? I think it gets worse in a Biden presidency. I think it helps to foment a lot of unrest. Say there is a Biden win that is contested by the Trump campaign to some degree. I think that QAnon foments a lot of real instability and potential violence through a lot of posts into those networks saying that this is it. This is the real final struggle because there trying to steal the election away from you. Give me an ideological evolution prediction. Say that period passes. Biden is inaugurated. Does the Q narrative become that Donald Trump was defeated, or is the narrative that in leaving the presidency, he has actually become even more powerful in the fight [CHARLIE LAUGHS] against cannibalistic pedophiles? Which way do you think it goes? I mean, if he’s defeated, he’s defeated because the enemies are really that powerful and treacherous and willing to steal whatever they want away from the true desire of the American people, so to speak. I can imagine a Donald Trump, who is now back at home in Mar-a-Lago in February 2021 stewing over this, truly embracing some of these ideas, especially if they lean towards the election was stolen for you, and really full-throatedly embracing that. I can see that as an extremely likely possibility that he becomes one of the influencers in this network. That seems like a real possibility. That’s exactly the kind of prediction I was hoping to coax out of you. [CHARLIE LAUGHS] So thank you. And I think we’ll leave the QAnon conversation there, and now I will try and coax something else out of you because we are ending the show with a recommendation. And last time you were on, I think you recommended that we check out a newsletter that sends out music to listen to while you work. So I’m wondering if you have any equally cool life hacks you can share this time. So I am an extremely disorganized person. And I have long taken all my to-do lists and notes and things like that and just sort of either scratched them out on pieces of paper or errant Google Docs or sent myself emails, and it’s all just a mess — all the notes I take when I interview people, all the lists and things and books I read, whatever. And somebody recommended this app to me, and it’s called Bear. And it is a note-taking app, and it syncs across all of your devices. Unfortunately, it is Apple only. But it is a really sleek, intuitive way to organize all kinds of thoughts. And you organize them through a little system of hashtags. It creates different folders. You can access it from pretty much any Apple device. And I have found that in this moment where everything feels like the walls are closing in, it is the one serene and peaceful place where I can start anew [MICHELLE LAUGHS] and organize my things. And so yeah, having all my interviews and my column ideas and notes on books that I’ve read and things like that has been legitimately very soothing. I would say do this digital housekeeping for yourself, and use this app if you feel like you don’t have a lot of control in the world right now. So Charlie, one more time, what’s the recommendation? The recommendation is the Bear note-taking app, B-E-A-R. It’ll give you just a little bit of calm, I hope. Terrific. Thank you so much. Yeah, thanks, Charlie. Thank you. And that’s our show for this week. Thank you so much for listening. If you have an election question you want to hear us debate, share it with us via voicemail by calling 347-915-4324.

I’m not even at the stage of organization where I have all this stuff on scattered pieces of paper. [LAUGHING] Yeah, no, listening to you, I’m like, wow, he has time to organize his life. He’s so lucky. I should say, these are the gilded problems of a person who isn’t trying to run a home school while working. [MICHELLE AND ROSS LAUGH] So I’m going to alienate 3/4 of “The Argument” audience. [LAUGHTER] TRANSCRIPT I’m Michelle Goldberg. I’m Ross Douthat, and this is “The Argument.” According to Bob Woodward, Donald Trump knowingly misled the public about the coronavirus in February, when it really mattered. How much blame does the president bear for the 200,000 and counting American lives lost to the virus? Then opinion writer-at-large Charlie Warzel joins us for a debate about the conspiracy turned political movement QAnon. What do QAnoners believe, and how seriously should we take them? Last week, Bob Woodward’s new book Rage quoted President Trump describing Covid-19 as airborne and deadly stuff in early February, at a time when his public denial about the virus still had weeks to run. This revelation followed the previous week’s fury over anonymous reports that Trump had sneered at the American war dead during a World War I commemoration. And there’s good reason to think we’ll have more of this as November nears — leaks and revelations about the president that seem to be saved up for the election homestretch. Michelle, we’ll get to the election in a minute, but I want to start with a counterfactual debate. What do you think would have happened if Trump had said publicly about Covid what he was saying to Woodward in February? Well, I think you would have had much less of a Republican anti-masking movement. You would have had much less of this sense that sort of defying social distancing regulations is a mark not just of conservatism, but really a mark of fealty to the president. We had this really dark moment when Herman Cain, the former Republican presidential candidate, died of Covid shortly after appearing unmasked at a Trump rally. And then his Twitter account, which somebody continues to maintain posthumously, was still tweeting out about how the danger of Covid is overrated. And I don’t think that you would have that sort of mentality, which is often taken as a sign of loyalty to the president and his movement. It just wouldn’t be. I think that if from the beginning, Trump had said this is extraordinarily dangerous and made masking part of his iconography, you would have conservatives adopt that. Trump followers have proven themselves pretty ideologically flexible in sort of jettisoning previously strongly-held beliefs, like Vladimir Putin is bad, the United States should not be part of an axis of murderous autocrats when they get a signal from the president. And I don’t think there was a lot of ideological freight attached previously to pandemic preparedness and warding off disease. So I think the movement would have shifted pretty easily behind him. So just to step back and give listeners a little context, I wrote a either incredibly badly-timed or incredibly well-timed, depending on your point of view, column just before the Woodward revelations came out where I argued that while Trump’s response to the coronavirus has been sort of transparently catastrophic, flailing, you know, whatever pejorative you want to use, it’s not totally clear that that flailing is actually the big reason why the U.S. has 200,000 deaths. And lots of people didn’t agree with that argument, to say the least. But I want to drill into what you just said, and then you can go back to telling me why I’m being silly. So when Trump has this interview with Woodward, it’s early to mid-February. And at that point, the sort of official scientific view is skeptical of masking. You have sort of formal recommendations from public health authorities saying that people shouldn’t wear masks, that masks aren’t effective against the virus. And it’s not clear how much of that is based on science and how much of it was kind of political strategy to prevent people from stockpiling masks because we didn’t have enough masks. But at the same time, you have sort of a run of public statements and commentary, including in our newspaper, arguing that people are being too fearful about the virus, that this is xenophobia and it’s going to encourage hostility to Asian people and hostility to immigrants and so on, right? But I don’t think they were saying that people are being too fearful about the virus. They were saying that there was no reason to direct that fear towards Asian-Americans or towards kind of American Chinatowns, right? That it was not more dangerous to go to Chinatown than it was to go to, at that point, to any other kind of crowded place with a lot of restaurants. And I don’t think we’ve seen any evidence that it was. I think you had some New York politicians and public leaders saying versions of that, but you also had people, like the head of the W.H.O, saying things like, xenophobia is right now more dangerous than the virus. Like, that was sort of a rhetorical trope that was in the air. And I guess I believe two things about this Trump and Woodward stuff. First, Trump absolutely should have been saying what he said to Woodward in public. And had he said it in public and certainly not taken the four weeks of wheel-spinning denial that followed, that the U.S. would probably be in some kind of better shape. At the same time, I also think if Trump had gone all in on masks, shutdowns, social distancing at that moment in mid-February, it would have prompted at least a mild and hopefully temporary liberal backlash where it was seen as Trump grabbing power and hyping a threat to help his re-election and feed xenophobia. And to me, the biggest question for the first wave of the coronavirus was what would have helped New York shut down a week sooner than it did, right? Because so many cases in the U.S. came in through New York. That became the epicenter of our first wave. And it’s just not totally clear to me that Bill de Blasio and Andrew Cuomo would have been encouraged to be more vigorous about shutting down the city if it was seen as a Trump policy. Do you think that’s wrong? You know, I think that might be true, but I just don’t think that you can reduce the American response to this calamity to those decisions. And it also seems strange to me to say, well, scientists got it wrong in February, when the data and what we know about this virus was still kind of quickly shifting and evolving, and kind of compare that to Trump, who has deliberately misled people once the data has come into much clearer focus, right? It’s true that people made mistakes, particularly around masking, that were really bad. But then they corrected them as new information came in, and that is sort of how you expect science to work. What Trump did is the opposite. He had secretly correct information and has spread and continues to spread falsehoods. So to me, those two things are not equivalent. Again, I’m not trying to make an argument for moral equivalence between Trump and anyone. I’m just curious about, I mean, literally what we think the effect on lives lost or saved would have been in that first wave. I mean, there’s also the problem of we were blind in this period because of failures specific to the C.D.C. that a better president than Trump might have done something about, but I think most presidents would have probably failed to do something about, where the C.D.C had all these testing foul-ups and we just didn’t know — Well, I don’t think you can — wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you can’t divorce the C.D.C. from Trump, right? The head of the C.D.C. is somebody that Trump installed there, that another president would not have put there. I think, from everything I’ve read, the choices that the C.D.C. made were characteristic bureaucratic turf-protection choices following standard practices at a moment when standard practices weren’t appropriate. I don’t think they were particularly Trumpy. I think that, again, a president who was super engaged in the issue, who was rising to the challenge would have been on the phone to the C.D.C. head every single day saying, what the hell is going on. You don’t think that there’s a consensus that Redfield has been sort of disastrous as the head of the C.D.C.? I don’t think Redfield’s done a good job, but I think that three-week failure from the C.D.C. was a failure of a Trump appointee being incompetent. I think it was a failure of a federal bureaucracy behaving the way bureaucracies do when they need to pivot and can’t because that’s not how they’re usually prepared to handle things. I don’t know. To me, that’s a kind of unfalsifiable question, right? Of whether if you had a better head of the C.D.C., the C.D.C. would have performed better. Right. I think that there is a counterfactual world in which a much better president than Donald Trump really successfully suppressed the virus. Anyway, let’s pivot quickly just to the election for a minute before we break because I think, as I said at the outset, one of the things that’s interesting about this is there was sort of a mini debate about whether Woodward had an obligation to publicize this when Trump said it, on the theory that publicizing this in February could have saved more lives and Woodward had some kind of obligation. And then there is a larger issue where the story of the week before, the story of Trump defaming the U.S. Dead, was a story that was basically 18 months or two years old and had clearly been sort of saved to be leaked by probably some military figures during the election. So I guess I’m curious what you think about the specific, should Woodward have brought this out earlier, but also what I imagine will be a continuing pattern of things Trump has said or done that are sort of saved up by his internal critics to be revealed in the homestretch of the election. I mean, I hope there’s a lot of those things, you know? I think that some of these Woodward revelations seem, unlike most revelations, to have mattered a bit. You can look at polling that shows people took them seriously. There was one Yahoo poll that showed even I think 15 percent of Trump supporters saying that they were influenced by these revelations about what Trump had said about the virus. It’s hard for me to say whether Woodward should have released them in February, in part because in February, I don’t think it was entirely clear how far Trump’s denialism was going to go, how far his administration’s interference with the scientific-based response was going to go, and also because he would have then shut down the possibility of being able to do all of these other interviews, which yielded important information. So I don’t know that him releasing this in February would have changed it. You know, I think it’s important that it’s out now, at a moment when people are able to really focus on the president’s response and make a decision about it. I have less sympathy for some of the people in Woodward’s book who had their own warnings about Trump that they have kept silent about. You know, Mattis spoke out about that grotesque photo-op after Trump used the military to clear protesters out of Lafayette Square. But in Woodward’s book, you have not just Mattis, but a lot of people talk about how dangerous and unfit Trump is. There’s some extremely damning quotes from Dan Coats, among others. There’s this passage I’ll read. “Mattis said they still had to consider stepping forward. ‘Jim, what would that be?’ Coats asked. ‘I don’t know,’ Mattis replied, ‘But we can’t let the country keep going on this course.’ He repeated, ‘this is dangerous.’ ‘Look,’ Coats said. ‘Others have tried it, and it’s had no impact whatsoever. They get tarred and feathered.’” And you know, if you have any kind of loyalty to this country and to its citizenry, you actually should be willing to go out and get tarred and feathered if you believe that you have information about an existential danger to the country. And so it’s just stunning to me, both that Coats still hasn’t come forward, besides kind of coming forward in this book because he’s obviously a source for Woodward, and his reason for not coming forward. His reason for not coming forward, at least in the book, isn’t I need to stay inside and kind of mitigate the damage as much as I can. It’s that I don’t think it’ll work because it hasn’t worked in the past, and so I’m not willing to stick my neck out, right? I mean, it’s just such astonishing cowardice. For all the talk about saving the republic and protecting the republic from Trump, the reality is that the thing that made Jim Mattis quit was a policy difference about pulling troops out of Syria. It often seems to me that these guys have concerns about Trump’s fitness for the job, but their breaking points are policy disagreements that are actually sort of sometimes places where Trump has a reasonable point and some places where — Well, first of all, Trump did not have a reasonable point about the way he pulled out of Syria, even if you think he has a reasonable point about pulling out of Syria. And Dan Coats thinks that Trump is compromised by Russia. That would have been a useful thing for him to mention during impeachment. He was a senator, and he’s complaining about how Republicans in the Senate are just completely failing to hold this president accountable. Again, that would have been a useful thing for him to say during impeachment. Yeah, I mean, I broadly agree with you. I think people who think that Trump is unfit for the job who worked for him should not be leaking anonymously to Jeffrey Goldberg. They should just be saying what they think, although Mattis did give his own interview to Jeffrey Goldberg that did say some reasonably — Well, and it wasn’t just the interview, right? He had the interview and then the statement. Right, right. But I just think they should all be out there much more publicly. There’s such a huge gap between the degree of alarm that they express in this book and the actions that they’ve taken in response. Yeah, and I think this sense that they have of futility, that people leave the Trump administration and speak out and it doesn’t matter because partisan polarization is so strong, I mean, that may be right as a sort of political— But it’s also self-fulfilling. Well, and it’s punditry, right? They’re sort of doing punditry. And I have plenty of respect for punditry. I’m doing it right now. But this was true during the 2016 campaign, right? When you had all of these Republicans saying, well, I can’t attack Trump too frontally because he’s benefiting from having the establishment against him. You know, you don’t know what’s going to happen. You shouldn’t play punditry about your views as a public figure engaged in a public debate. You should state those views and let the chips fall where they may. All right, I think that’s a good place to break. We’ll be right back [MUSIC PLAYING] And we’re back. Longtime “Argument” listeners will recognize our guest for today’s second segment, Charlie Warzel, the opinion section’s writer-at-large who covers technology, media and politics. Charlie, welcome back to the show. Thanks for having me. You’re very welcome. Your home base — in spite of the at-large title, you actually do have a home base — is usually Montana, but I know you’re in the Pacific Northwest right now. Can you tell us what color the sky is outside your window? It’s a wonderful mixture of fog and smoke, which has just created a full five-feet-away gray wall. But that is actually, interestingly enough, an improvement from the — Yeah, that sounds like an improvement from apocalyptic orange. Yeah, it’s better than the tobacco-stained yellow kind of thing. But still, when I go outside, regardless of what I do, even if it’s just for a minute or two, it feels like I’ve smoked a cigar. [MICHELLE SHARPLY INHALES] This is day five or six of this, and it’s quite a lot to deal with on top of the rest of 2020’s indignities. Well, we’ve actually invited you on today to talk about something that’s apocalyptic in a somewhat different sense, which is the conspiratorial worldview of QAnon, which has been steadily gaining adherents across the Trump presidency and may even have representation in Congress soon enough. I just want to note for our listeners, because of the nature of this theory, the segment to come will include discussion of pedophilia and the trafficking of minors, which might be upsetting to some listeners. Charlie, we’re going to get to questions that are central to your beat right now about the role of the internet in spreading conspiracy theories and more, but I want to start with the basics. As someone who’s been following this for a while, can you explain to the uninitiated what is QAnon? At heart it is what I’m calling a collaborative fiction. But it is a conspiratorial mass of theories that center around almost a biblical struggle of good versus evil, in which Donald Trump and the Trumpist Republicans are crusading against a true rot in the world. They are trying to purge the deep state of its globalist elite figures, who are consolidating power in order to do absolutely terrible things. And these are things like child sex trafficking. These are things like pagan or satanic rituals in which there is human sacrifice among children, and it gets weirder from there. But the general gist is that the political divide in this world is less ideological than it is a true moral battle of prime good versus extreme evil and that that evil needs to be extinguished. And it is a fight that isn’t just done through policy or legislation. It’s a fight that is done by imprisoning your enemies, by locking them up, by executing them. So I want to go back to the origin point for a minute. The big antecedent to QAnon was Pizzagate, which was the theory that a cabal of Washington DC elites, mostly Democrats — Yep. — were kidnapping children into sex slavery in a ring that was based in the basement of the Comet Ping Pong pizza parlor in Northwest Washington D.C. This was a conspiracy theory that sort of plucked some details from the emails from John Podesta that were leaked by Wikileaks.The narrative of pedophiles in power sort of starts there. And then what “Q” does, who is the anonymous poster who starts this all, he goes online and says, look, I have inside information that everything you think is going on in the Trump era is wrong, that Trump isn’t actually being investigated by Robert Mueller. He is cooperating with Robert Mueller because they’re working together to put these elite pedophiles, as you said, Charlie, in jail. So that’s sort of the pivot that takes us from Pizzagate to Q. Is that right? Yeah, the best way I’ve heard it described as that QAnon is sort of the big-budget sequel to Pizzagate. There was sort of a proof of concept there that it was a very viral, very appealing conspiracy theory to some people, as we saw with the real-world violence and escalation. And so yes, this is sort of a supercharged version of this. But it seems like another antecedent to it QAnon is the “Protocols of the Elders of Zion” and also the kind of classic anti-Semitic blood libel. The “Protocols of the Elders of Zion” is a Russian forgery, which is obviously a theme that’s pretty prevalent in a lot of our modern conspiracy theories. But it’s this Russian forgery that holds that there’s this evil, secret, globalist, Jewish elite who are running things and responsible for all the unrest and disasters in the world. And then there’s also this sort of classic anti-Semitic trope of the blood libel, which is that the evil Jewish cabal is harvesting the blood of Christian children to make their matzah. And this is just a staple of anti-Semitic ideology. It was kind of a staple of Der Stürmer. QAnon just seems to me to be a continuation of these classic anti-Semitic storylines in a slightly different guise, maybe less overtly targeting Jewish people, although they do still have George Soros up there pulling all the strings. I think that’s a great point, and I’m glad you brought it up. It’s very true. QAnon has a great deal of the anti-Semitic tropes to it, especially the Soros-related globalist Rothschild banker elites controlling the world. The blood libel elements of that, I completely agree. As far as ties to Russia, I think it’s worth being very clear that it’s super difficult to divine where this conspiracy is coming from. Oh no, I’m not trying to blame it on Russia. I just am making a point that, you know, Russian forgeries about the ritual murder of children are not a new thing in Western politics. Absolutely. And what’s important to know is that once something like this is out there, regardless of its origin, in terms of who the first Q post was authored by or subsequent posts, these theories are observed by our enemies, and they are weaponized by them and used to sow further division and discord. But I think you’re right in the sense that QAnon is not new, in the sense. But what is new about it is I keep going back to this idea that it is a big-tent conspiracy theory. I mean, they — So is anti-Semitism. Absolutely. At the core of it, people think that the Donald Trump pedophile-remover-in-chief trait is core to this, but you don’t actually have to believe in that to be welcomed by the QAnon community. And that’s what I think is so insidious about it is it’s luring people in through these other methods. So I want to talk about the possible dangers in a minute. I’m curious. Charlie, you just described the core of it as the idea of Donald Trump, anti-pedophile warrior. And I’m looking at the Wikipedia page for QAnon, which has a useful sentence. QAnon is a far-right conspiracy theory alleging that a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles running a global child sex trafficking ring is plotting against Donald Trump, who is battling them, leading to a day of reckoning involving mass arrests, right? That’s a good one-sentence capsule summary. Yeah. And then Wikipedia is careful to say, no part of the theory is based on fact. That’s an interesting sentence because I think one question that I always have about conspiracy theories is, you know, do real-world events matter to them or not? Because I could tell you a story where QAnon is a kind of elaborate fiction that is being constructed around and validated by a lot of real-world events, right? You know, the story of the last 20 years has been one of sort of cascading revelations starting within literally my own religion, the Roman Catholic Church, continuing through the Harvey Weinstein moment, the Hollywood pedophile reckoning down through Jeffrey Epstein that, in fact, there are networks of pedophiles and sort of generally sexually-exploitative people in positions of power, who in the case of Epstein, have connections to the British royal family, the Clinton family, former Prime Minister of Israel, and so on — And Trump. — and all of that is — and Trump! Oh, right, right. And all of that is real. I’m curious if you think that matters, right? Is the existence of actual pedophile rings, actual networks of exploiters crucial to the appeal of this theory, or is it sort of just an accident of history that we have the Jeffrey Epstein revelations and QAnon gets more popular at the same time? I don’t think it’s a coincidence at all. When Jeffrey Epstein’s arrest and subsequent death in jail was unfolding with all the confusion and mysteries involved — Many of them still unresolved, I want to point out. Many of them still unresolved. I mean, I wrote that this was a super-charging moment for that conspiracy theory and for this in general. And yes, you’re right. We’re living in a time where there are very real conspiracies in plain sight. We’re living in a time when a lot of the quiet part is being said out loud, and I think that that only adds to this. And what’s dangerous and where that line in the Wikipedia page I think is important is that QAnon takes these real conspiracies or these real-life events, and it spins them completely. So the connection of Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, the videos of them at parties together sort of ogling women, when those emerged, rather than the QAnon people starting to say, wow, maybe this is deeper than we thought. Maybe our hero was actually a part of this larger network. Maybe he’s part of the problem, too. It was spun that Donald Trump is a longtime undercover agent who has been working for decades and decades — Right. — infiltrating these networks, cozying up to people like Jeffrey Epstein in order to understand them and in order to destroy them. And look, Jeffrey Epstein was brought to justice. He is dead, and therefore, this is all a part of the plan. Charlie, do you think that part of QAnon could be a coping mechanism for a lot of people? Because one of the things that makes QAnon, it seems to me, different than most other conspiracy theories, and I’ve written about this, is that usually conspiracy theories are about this malevolent power that’s secretly running things, right? And in this case, it’s a conspiracy theory that benevolent powers are working behind the scenes, that there are actually good people in charge of world events, despite all of appearances to the contrary. I can’t think of another conspiracy theory like that. But I wonder if people just have a hard time. I mean, I have a hard time facing the fact to which our country is being ruled by villains and idiots, that no one is in charge. And I think I had a vague sense before all this, even though I consider myself fairly informed about politics, that if things went this far, someone would do something, right? That there was someone who had the sort of power to hold things together and they wouldn’t let things get this out of hand. And I wonder if there are people who think that if this is being allowed to happen, it must be being allowed to happen for a reason. Otherwise, you would have to face the near dissolution of American democracy and kind of the fate of the republic. It’s absolutely a coping mechanism. I look at it a little less, though, as people who are paying strict attention to the politics of the moment, and I think I look at it a little bit more of the people who’ve been left behind by the moment and their government. Even though it started out following the Mueller investigation, I think it’s a coping mechanism for the breakdowns in American life. The best person I’ve talked to about QAnon is actually a video-game designer, and he designs alternate-reality games, which are games that aren’t console video games. They’re games that sort of unfold over a bunch of different media. They set up fake email addresses. They set up fake web pages. They plant things, little clues. It’s almost like a long treasure hunt, clues in newspaper, like print newspaper advertisements, things like that. They’re very popular in the 2000s and 2010s. And this person said that QAnon resembles, to him, an alternate-reality game in that the designers create a framework, and then the people playing get so immersed. They know they’re playing, but they get so immersed that they start to almost rewrite the game. They start to take control of it. They see little gaps and holes that the designers never anticipated, and then they start building it together, which is why I call it a collaborative fiction. I asked him, when do people stop playing the game? And he said, even if you end the game, as the creator, people will still play, as long as it gives them a reason, as long as it gives them a community. And in these games, the main tie is a community that forms, is an accepting group of people, a community that rewards different people’s skills. And QAnon, a lot of that is online research and drawing connections between very vague things. Right. It turns you into someone with a great skill, and you become a truth-seeker. And as these crises overlap on each other — a pandemic with climate-related natural disasters with an election with political polarization — it gets very intense very quickly. There’s a fire burning, and QAnon is a real accelerant. And right now, they think that someone else is in charge, right? Like, right now, they think someone else is going to conduct these mass arrests and executions, if necessary. And so to me, the question is, what happens when Trump is defeated and the prophecy fails? It seems like you’ll have many more people willing to sort of take matters into their own hands, especially if they’re genuinely convinced that the people running the country are harvesting the blood of innocent children. Maybe, although again, this goes to sort of, Charlie, what you were saying about the internet as accelerant, right? But one of the interesting things in my reading on conspiracy theories is that it seems historically, it’s been very possible for people to hold views that if you took them literally would mean that their government was run by the worst human beings imaginable and not have that lead to insane levels of political violence, right? Like, if you read a really good book called “The United States of Paranoia” by a writer named Jesse Walker that I would recommend to people interested in the history of conspiracy theories in U.S. life. And I read it a while ago, but one of the things I took from it is that there is historically usually a gap between what people will sort of commit to believing about the evils in high places and how they will actually act. And I mean, that extends even to sort of recent things like 9/11 trutherism, right? You could get a reasonably large number of people on the political left to assent in polling questions about George W. Bush’s responsibility for 9/11, to assent to views that if you took them literally would mean that the country was run by the most despicable treasonous horror show, right? But there was not actually a major wave of left-wing political violence when George W. Bush won re-election in 2004. And I think historically that’s often been true, that people will say they believe that lizard people are running everything without, in their everyday lives, acting like lizard people are really running everything. I think you’re right that conspiracy theories don’t always lead to mass violence. At the same time, mass violence and genocide is almost always preceded by some sort of conspiracy theories, right? So maybe not every Radio Rwanda is going to end in the Rwandan genocide, but it’s usually, I think, a necessary if not sufficient, precondition. And it’s obviously not the only precondition to mass unrest in this country right now. Yeah, the way that I’m looking at this is these conspiracies are meeting the moment, and the moment is incredibly charged already with violence and with fear and anger and hostility. And that is actually what’s worrying me more is that these theories seem to be hitting harder and sticking with people. And the last thing that I’ve really been noticing is the effect of the pandemic. In the last six months, I have watched again the acceleration of this, and I’m really seeing it in the last month, where it seems like people who kind of held pretty mainstream beliefs have been sucked in or have had these theories court them because they’ve been stuck inside. They’ve had a lot of time. They may have lost their jobs. And it feels like everything is moving a little bit faster, and that, to me, is what’s scary. So I think that that gap between what you’re reading and action is narrowing as the election looms and as all these crises feel more pressing to people. To be reductionist, you’re talking about people being stuck indoors and so on. I mean, this is the first era in human history when everyone is on the internet. To what extent is this the internet? To what extent is this Facebook? There is a sort of ongoing, rolling argument, especially on the left, that Facebook specifically is failing in its responsibility to police conspiracy theories. Do you think that’s right? Well, I do. To take the Facebook point, what I go back to is — I believe it was June, it might have been July of 2017 — Mark Zuckerberg gathered all these community moderators who run Facebook pages and groups in Chicago for the first-ever Facebook Community Summit. And he gave the speech, and it’s about 14, 15 minutes long. And it’s really an amazing document to go back to because he says, we’re going to shift Facebook priorities towards helping you build more meaningful communities. And the way that you do that in the real world is it’s not just you flip through a book and decide to join a book club or go to some knitting group. They’re recommended by friends. They’re recommended by people who know you. It’s networks building on other networks. And he said, so we’re building the best algorithms we can to understand you and recommend you communities based on your interests that will be meaningful to you. And the way in which it’s described, QAnon is proof of a massive success on that front. And then as you tell that story, I mean, is this a Facebook problem, or is it an internet problem, right? Because in 2017, I probably wrote columns like this, right? There was tons of coverage and argument about isolation and alienation and crippling loneliness and personal anxiety as the chief fruits of social media, that people weren’t in communities. They were sort of just alone, performing for a crowd, and maybe being polarized just by the hysteria of their newsfeeds or something. So there is a way in which Zuckerberg is being responsive to what seems like the problem of loneliness and isolation on social media. And the problem is that when you pivot to community, it turns out that the communities that the internet builds are communities of hysterical conspiracy. Then Facebook steps in and breaks up these communities, and then you’re back to the loneliness and anomie problem of social media, right? Right. I mean, it’s an internet problem, for sure. Again, nothing about a lot of these conspiratorial dynamics are new, per se, but the internet supercharges it. The internet allows it to happen at a scale that we’re not used to, that is unprecedented. Facebook has a responsibility here if it’s going to have this primacy in the world, if it’s going to be allowed to operate at such scale. QAnon is a dangerous group, a dangerous community. Yes, it is a community. But it is a community based in a conspiracy theory that never came true, that Hillary Clinton was about to be sent off to Guantanamo Bay for being involved with sex trafficking. And as we’ve talked through here, it is anti-Semitic in nature. It is dangerous in what it asks you to do to fight your political opponents. And I think in a similar way to how Facebook treats other dangerous communities, other extremist communities, it purges them, and it doesn’t necessarily — anymore, at least — think twice about purging a white nationalist community. But we should say that there have been, in the last year, serious Facebook purges of QAnon. The argument is that they have come too late. It’s a little late. I mean, they’re trying now. But again, these networks are dense, and they’re very resilient. So they’ll pop up around new-age wellness, or they’ll rebrand themselves as children — against sex trafficking websites. And they pivot off real-world events, right? Like, if you have something like the Jeffrey Epstein thing and you have a large population commenting on it and theorizing about it, those are, in a sense, conspiracy theories, but they’re also theories that you know a social network that wants to have a reasonable range of debate needs to leave up, right? I mean, again, the power of conspiracy theory is there’s a ton of ambiguity about what constitutes a conspiracy theory and what constitutes commenting on the news of the day. Wait, so this is Ross being QAnon adjacent. How do you know I’m not Q himself? I may be running it. [GOLDBERG LAUGHS] I think it’s totally reasonable to think that it’s dangerous and insane. My question is more like, to what extent is the internet accelerating versus to what extent is the internet sort of exposing patterns of conspiratorial thinking that are common to American history in all times and places that we just didn’t see? I feel like, obviously, fact-checking is sort of completely inadequate to misinformation in this era. Asking the platforms to behave responsibly has not worked. This is maybe a dark response to QAnon and other sorts of internet phenomenon, but I don’t understand — or maybe this has happened. Tell me if this has happened. Why aren’t more people trying to infiltrate these communities? [CHARLIE LAUGHS] It seems like it wouldn’t be that hard to build up a profile in this community and start turning people against each other, start sending people off in different directions. Why isn’t anyone trying to do that? I’m not sure that’s not already happening. While you do see people mobilizing out in the streets and there are some influencer types, a lot of what’s happening in this movement is all just anonymous. I’ve been in some of these groups. There is infighting, right? There is fracture. There is a split. But then those groups go off and form their own node. So I think this is a dynamic situation. It is moving. I think there are people that are going to try to do exactly what you’re saying. How do we know this isn’t how it started, right? What if the original Q was a left-wing operative trying to build up Republican hopes for Donald Trump and then, in theory, make them go insane if he failed? Well, that would be a left-wing operative with a very poor reading of cult history, right? I mean, I feel like that person clearly should have read “When Prophecy Fails” and a whole host of other literature about how people respond to having their conspiracy theories disproven. What’s kind of funny is that you guys are having a conversation that you actually see on some of these terrible message boards and some of these awful threads, which is, to bring it back to the story about the Oregon fires last weekend, there is a photo of a bunch of masked people who look like they were wearing firefighting gear and one of them has a gas canister on their back. And they’re holding an Antifa flag. And all these people are saying, look, see? They’re clearly setting these fires. This is proof. And then someone’s saying, well, actually, the gas can is for the chainsaw there. It’s like, well, that’s what they want you to think, that it’s for the chainsaw. And really, what this is to try to do is to try to make us discredit ourselves. So if we attack them — and it’s just this game of who started the fire. It almost, to some degree, just doesn’t matter. I keep asking these people who are actual researchers and have spent years now tracking QAnon and said, what happens if tomorrow, Q was unmasked, and we figured out who the person was dead to rights. And regardless of who the person is, they don’t think it matters. It’s gone too far. I mean, yes, you’d peel a few people off. Is there any significant body of ex-QAnon people? I mean, you have sort of refugees from all other sorts of cults. It’s starting to happen. A lot of these stories, though, people I’ve been in touch with actually have incredibly traumatic stories because a lot of these people are sex abuse survivors who have longstanding mental health issues who’ve been kind of sucked into the movement and spit out by it and hurt. We don’t quite yet have the very loud poster boy or girl of the movement yet, like a Derek Black or something like that, who has come out of the darkness and seen the light. So I think that’s all coming. This is another part that’s worth mentioning is that this is all still very new. And it’s centrality to politics, talking about Marjorie Taylor Greene, who looks like she’s going to be elected to Congress who fervently believes this, there are other candidates who have these leanings and QAnon support, but she’s going to be the first. So we’re still actually, strangely, in the early days of this, and I think there’s a lot to be determined about where this goes with a potential Joe Biden presidency versus a second Trump term. And honestly, I wouldn’t make a lot of predictions right now. No, no, well, I was just going to say, since we’re coming to the end of our segment, do you want to leave us with a prediction for QAnon and a Biden presidency? I think it gets worse in a Biden presidency. I think it helps to foment a lot of unrest. Say there is a Biden win that is contested by the Trump campaign to some degree. I think that QAnon foments a lot of real instability and potential violence through a lot of posts into those networks saying that this is it. This is the real final struggle because there trying to steal the election away from you. Give me an ideological evolution prediction. Say that period passes. Biden is inaugurated. Does the Q narrative become that Donald Trump was defeated, or is the narrative that in leaving the presidency, he has actually become even more powerful in the fight [CHARLIE LAUGHS] against cannibalistic pedophiles? Which way do you think it goes? I mean, if he’s defeated, he’s defeated because the enemies are really that powerful and treacherous and willing to steal whatever they want away from the true desire of the American people, so to speak. I can imagine a Donald Trump, who is now back at home in Mar-a-Lago in February 2021 stewing over this, truly embracing some of these ideas, especially if they lean towards the election was stolen for you, and really full-throatedly embracing that. I can see that as an extremely likely possibility that he becomes one of the influencers in this network. That seems like a real possibility. That’s exactly the kind of prediction I was hoping to coax out of you. [CHARLIE LAUGHS] So thank you. And I think we’ll leave the QAnon conversation there, and now I will try and coax something else out of you because we are ending the show with a recommendation. And last time you were on, I think you recommended that we check out a newsletter that sends out music to listen to while you work. So I’m wondering if you have any equally cool life hacks you can share this time. So I am an extremely disorganized person. And I have long taken all my to-do lists and notes and things like that and just sort of either scratched them out on pieces of paper or errant Google Docs or sent myself emails, and it’s all just a mess — all the notes I take when I interview people, all the lists and things and books I read, whatever. And somebody recommended this app to me, and it’s called Bear. And it is a note-taking app, and it syncs across all of your devices. Unfortunately, it is Apple only. But it is a really sleek, intuitive way to organize all kinds of thoughts. And you organize them through a little system of hashtags. It creates different folders. You can access it from pretty much any Apple device. And I have found that in this moment where everything feels like the walls are closing in, it is the one serene and peaceful place where I can start anew [MICHELLE LAUGHS] and organize my things. And so yeah, having all my interviews and my column ideas and notes on books that I’ve read and things like that has been legitimately very soothing. I would say do this digital housekeeping for yourself, and use this app if you feel like you don’t have a lot of control in the world right now. So Charlie, one more time, what’s the recommendation? The recommendation is the Bear note-taking app, B-E-A-R. It’ll give you just a little bit of calm, I hope. Terrific. Thank you so much. Yeah, thanks, Charlie. Thank you.

I’m not even at the stage of organization where I have all this stuff on scattered pieces of paper. [LAUGHING] Yeah, no, listening to you, I’m like, wow, he has time to organize his life. He’s so lucky. I should say, these are the gilded problems of a person who isn’t trying to run a home school while working. [MICHELLE AND ROSS LAUGH] So I’m going to alienate 3/4 of “The Argument” audience. [LAUGHTER] Listen and subscribe to “The Argument” from your mobile device: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google Play | RadioPublic | Stitcher | RSS Feed After Bob Woodward’s latest book revealed just how much President Trump knowingly misled the public about the coronavirus, how much blame does he bear for the nearly 200,000 American lives lost to the virus? Michelle and Ross discuss counterfactuals and disagree about culpability — both the president’s, and that of the alarmed but withholding members of his administration. Then, Opinion writer Charlie Warzel joins the podcast to debunk QAnon, for a conversation about the role the “collaborative fiction” plays in American’s psyche and politics. Is it a collective coping mechanism in difficult times? A remix on old anti-Semitic themes? And is it all Facebook’s fault? Finally, if your thoughts and notes are as disorganized as Charlie’s, well, he’s got an app for that. Background Reading: Charlie on Facebook’s outsized power, QAnon in Congress and why it’s the most dangerous conspiracy theory of the 21st century Ross on what isn’t Trump’s fault, and on Jeffrey Epstein and QAnon Michelle on Woodward’s revelations and her April 2018 article on QAnon How to listen to “The Argument”: Press play or read the transcript (found by midday Friday above the center teal eye) at the top of this page, or tune in on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, Stitcher or your preferred podcast listening app. Tell us what you think at argument@nytimes.com. I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they intersect. I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis, and decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have four small children, three girls and a boy, and live in New Haven with my wife. @DouthatNYT I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter. @michelleinbklyn “The Argument” is a production of The New York Times Opinion section.
