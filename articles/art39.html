Trump starts raising money for new ‘Save America’ PAC, which will enable him to fund his future activities. Biden will speak on Obamacare after the Supreme Court indicated it would uphold the bulk of the law. As the transition begins, the stark contrast between Biden and Trump persists. Disinformation and falsehoods about Biden’s victory flood social media and search engines. With Senate control up for grabs, McConnell and Schumer will continue to lead their parties. Trump’s refusal to concede affects Biden’s access to classified information. A week after the election, many House and two Senate races are undecided. Hillary Clinton highlights the ‘gracious’ letter the last losing Republican president wrote to his successor. President Trump is directing money raised through his campaign’s breathless requests to “defend the election” into a new political action committee before his recount fund, a move that allows him greater flexibility to fund his future political endeavors. The new group, called Save America, is a federal fund-raising vehicle known as a leadership PAC that has donation limits of $5,000 per donor per year. It will be used to underwrite Mr. Trump’s post-presidential activities, tapping into the vast reservoir of small donors that made him a dominant fund-raiser, for a time, in 2020. But it is likely to have far greater significance for a man who is refusing not only to concede the election but remains reluctant to surrender the spotlight. In that sense, his PAC could become a fan-subsidized machine to perpetuate his agenda and plot his next moves. In the days since the election, Mr. Trump’s campaign has blitzed supporters with text messages and emails almost hourly, spreading unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud and asking supporters to give to the “official election defense fund.” “We need YOUR HELP to DEFEND the integrity of our Election,” read one email early Tuesday morning. The fine print shows where the money is actually going. Initially, 60 percent of donations were going to pay off debts that the Trump campaign had accumulated. But as of Tuesday, that had shifted. Now, 60 percent of donations are earmarked for Save America, which was registered with the Federal Election Commission on Monday by Bradley T. Crate. Mr. Crate also serves as Mr. Trump’s campaign treasurer. Only after a donor gives more than $5,000 does any of the money go to the recount account that Mr. Trump set up. In addition, 40 percent of every donation goes to the Republican National Committee. “Small donors who give thinking they’re helping to defend the integrity of our election are in fact largely helping to finance Trump’s post-presidential political ventures,” said Brendan M. Fischer, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group. Mr. Trump can use the new political action committee to support other candidates, as well to fund his own travel, polling and political team. Republicans will likely be clamoring for the help, given the fact that Mr. Trump matched or outperformed many down-ballot candidates in their own districts. The first test is likely to come during Georgia’s January runoff for a pair of Senate seats occupied by Trump loyalists David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. The outcome of the runoff will decide which party controls the Senate. Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, said on Monday that the leadership PAC had been planned before the election. “The president always planned to do this, win or lose, so he can support candidates and issues he cares about, such as combating voter fraud,” Mr. Murtaugh said. Leadership PACs are generally seen as loosely regulated — Joseph R. Biden Jr. operated one during the 2018 midterms ahead of his own presidential run — and the committee gives the Mr. Trump a place to continue to direct supporter cash. One advantage for Mr. Trump is that the leadership PAC gives him more latitude than the recount account, which is more limited in its use, according to campaign finance experts. “There is far more flexibility with how a candidate can use a leadership PAC than a recount account,” Mr. Fischer said. — Shane Goldmacher, Maggie Haberman and Rachel Shorey WILMINGTON, Del. — President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. plans to deliver a health care speech this afternoon focusing on the Trump administration’s effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act, hours after the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case and indicated it was unlikely to strike down the law. The law, pushed by former President Barack Obama, provides insurance coverage for tens of millions of Americans, guaranteeing covering for pre-existing medical conditions and providing other popular provisions, including coverage for prescription drugs and visits to the emergency room. But President Trump and Republican state officials argue that a key provision of the law — the mandate that individuals purchase insurance — is unconstitutional because Congress reduced the penalty to zero, removing the justification that it was essentially a tax. The Supreme Court had upheld that justification in 2015. It was not clear whether the court would strike down the mandate. But at least five justices, including two members of the court’s conservative majority, suggested that doing so would not invalidate the rest of the law. Mr. Biden made the fate of the Affordable Care Act a central part of his campaign for the White House, arguing that if Republicans succeeded in convincing the justices to declare the law unconstitutional, Mr. Trump was not prepared to offer people an alternative for coverage. The president-elect has said he wants to strengthen the A.C.A. by offering a so-called public option, allowing people to receive coverage the way Medicare enrollees do, through a system of government-run insurance. People who would prefer to stay on private insurance would be able to do so. In his remarks today, Mr. Biden plans to talk about “the stakes for families across the country in Texas v. California, the Trump administration’s lawsuit to overturn the Affordable Care Act, and his plan to expand access to quality, affordable health care,” according to a statement released by his transition team. Officials said that Mr. Biden would be joined at the event by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who as a candidate for president had pushed for a “Medicare for all” single-payer system of government health insurance favored by liberal Democrats. The Affordable Care Act has survived two earlier challenges in the Supreme Court. But three new justices, all Trump appointees, have joined the court since the last one. One of them, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, has been publicly critical of the earlier rulings. — Michael D. Shear and Adam Liptak For months, Joseph R. Biden Jr. campaigned in part on a simple promise: Elect him, and the chaos and confusion, hirings and firings and the unending stream of derisive tweets would end. And in the first workday of the transition, the dichotomy in style between President-elect Biden and President Trump came once again into stark relief. Just minutes after Mr. Biden held a news conference to address his plans for confronting the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Trump announced on Twitter that he had fired his defense secretary. And he continued to be active on his favorite social media platform on Monday, offering more unsubstantiated and false claims of election fraud, as news broke of additional coronavirus cases within his inner circle, including Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development. By contrast, Mr. Biden and his team continued to offer measured statements as they began to sketch out their transition plan and build their team. The president-elect unveiled a 13-person virus-task force while continuing to urge Americans to wear masks and seeking to temper expectations about a virus vaccine that has shown positive early results. “It’s clear that this vaccine, even if approved, will not be widely available for many months yet to come,” Mr. Biden said about a vaccine made by Pfizer. “The challenge before us right now is still immense and growing.” Even as Mr. Biden pressed ahead with his transition plans, the Trump campaign and its allies were continuing their frenetic fight to challenge the results of the election, which Mr. Trump has lost. On Monday, the Trump campaign announced it had filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania asserting that ballots cast in person there were scrutinized more closely than those sent by mail. And by the end of the evening, Attorney General William P. Barr had issued a memo authorizing federal prosecutors to investigate some allegations of voter fraud — a move that broke with the Justice Department’s longstanding policies intended to prevent law enforcement from affecting the outcome of an election. The move also prompted the Justice Department official who oversees investigations of voter fraud, Richard Pilger, to step down from his post within hours. The leadership of the Republican Party also joined Mr. Trump in refusing to concede defeat, signaling the potential for a continued struggle in the days and weeks ahead. In his first comments since Mr. Biden was declared the winner of the election, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, argued that the president was “100 percent within his rights” to challenge its outcome. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, followed Mr. McConnell on the floor and stated simply: “Joe Biden won this election fair and square.” — Matt Stevens As President Trump and his team continue to circulate fabricated claims of a stolen election and voter fraud, their allies are flooding the internet search engines and social media with falsehoods intended to question the legitimacy of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory. This dynamic — the Trump team broadcasting misinformation, which is then plugged into the high-wattage amplifier of social media — was a defining feature of Mr. Trump’s campaign and administration and has, if anything, intensified in the wake of his defeat. One particular brazen example surfaced early Tuesday. Some users who entered the search phrase “Biden loses PA” into Google — not an uncommon search given Mr. Trump’s claims — were directed to a page topped with a YouTube video entitled “Biden Loses Pennsylvania and Loses President-Elect Status.” If the term “Biden loses” is entered, another video entitled “Breaking News!!! Biden Loses President-Elect Status” message appears for some users as the top video result. These claims are false. Many Republicans have privately conceded that Mr. Trump’s path to victory is nonexistent but have been reluctant to challenge him. On Monday, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, refused to acknowledge Mr. Biden as the president-elect and said Mr. Trump was “100 percent” within his rights to pursue legal remedies and recounts, though he did not comment on what he thinks the outcome of such outcomes will be. In the next breath, Mr. McConnell celebrate the victories of many Republican candidates — that were won in the same election. As of Tuesday morning, Mr. Biden was ahead by more than 45,000 votes in Pennsylvania, and while counting is still going on, his lead is insurmountable, according to analysts. While Mr. Trump’s allies have focused their legal fights on Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia, Mr. Biden’s margins of victory in those states are also highly unlikely to be overturned. The first video, posted by an obscure YouTube user who is linked to a blog that promotes conspiracy theories about the media, touts a debunked and fictitious claim that the political website RealClearPolitics rescinded Mr. Biden’s win in Pennsylvania, and hence revoked his status as president-elect. While most major news outlets, including The New York Times, called the race for Mr. Biden on Saturday, RealClearPolitics has been more cautious. It has not declared a winner, pending the outcomes in several states, including North Carolina and Alaska, where Mr. Trump is currently ahead. That did not stop Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s lawyer, who has claimed — without providing evidence — that Democrats stole the election, from posting a tweet late Monday claiming the site had taken away Pennsylvania and made it a “toss up.” Tom Bevan, who runs RealClearPolitics, quickly shot back, “This is false. We never called Pennsylvania, and nothing has changed.” Mr. Giuliani, who has roughly one million followers on Twitter, did not remove his post. He did not immediately return multiple requests for comment. Pam Bondi, another Trump legal adviser who has 110,000 followers, tweeted out a similar message, but deleted it late Monday. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump’s former press secretary, took it a step further, appending a correction to his original tweet echoing the claim. But the misinformation has spread through Facebook and Twitter anyway, amplified on social media by Trump supporters who have large followings, including Scott Presler and Diamond and Silk. “If you thought disinformation on Facebook was a problem during our election, just wait until you see how it is shredding the fabric of our democracy in the days after,” Bill Russo, a Biden press aide who has criticized social media companies, tweeted on Monday. — Glenn Thrush and Linda Qiu Transition officials for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. called on a top Trump administration appointee on Monday to end what they said was unwarranted obstruction of the money and access that federal law says must flow to the winner of a presidential election. The officials, speaking on background to reporters on Monday night, said it was nearly unprecedented for Emily W. Murphy, the administrator of the General Services Administration, to refuse to issue a letter of “ascertainment,” which allows Mr. Biden’s transition team to begin the transfer of power. By law, Ms. Murphy, the head of the sprawling agency that keeps the federal government functioning, must formally recognize Mr. Biden as the incoming president for his transition to begin. It has been three days since news organizations projected that he was the winner of the election, and Ms. Murphy has still not acted. The transition officials said her inaction was preventing Mr. Biden’s teams from moving into government offices, including secure facilities where they can discuss classified information. The teams cannot meet with their counterparts in agencies or begin background checks of cabinet nominees that require top-secret access. A White House official pointed out, as several Trump allies have, that the transition after the 2000 election was delayed by the court fight between the campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas over several weeks. The official said it would be strange for President Trump to send some kind of a signal to allow the transition to start while he was still engaged in court fights. But Mr. Biden’s aides said that the dispute in 2000 involved one state with only about 500 ballots separating the winner and loser, far less than in the current contest. In every other presidential race for the past 60 years, the determination of a winner was made within 24 hours, the aides said — even as legal challenges and recounts continued for weeks. A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a question about whether Mr. Trump was willing to let Ms. Murphy begin the transition without a concession from him. — Michael D. Shear, Maggie Haberman and Michael Crowley Worried that the Trump administration might destroy files as its members leave the White House, the Democratic heads of 21 House committees sent letters on Tuesday to more than 50 federal agencies, demanding they comply with federal record-keeping laws and preserve information sought in congressional subpoenas and investigations. “As the Trump administration prepares for the transition of power to the new Biden administration, we write to remind you that all Executive Office of the President employees and officials must comply with record preservation obligations set forth in federal law and preserve information relevant to congressional oversight,” wrote the chairs of the committees, including Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform. Among the demands in the letters were orders for the White House to preserve all records in accordance with the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act, as well as any documents that may be requested as part of a congressional investigation. “You are obligated to ensure that any information previously requested by Congress — and any other information that is required by law to be preserved — is saved and appropriately archived in a manner that is easily retrievable,” the Democrats wrote. House Democrats have opened numerous investigations into the Trump administration during the president’s four years in office, including, most recently, probes into Customs and Border Protection agents who allegedly engaged in misconduct, attempts to withhold federal funds from local jurisdictions, and the performance of the Postal Service. — Luke Broadwater Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, will continue to steer their respective parties in the 117th Congress, though it remains unclear which man will be majority leader given the prospect of two Senate runoff races in Georgia. Both men were unanimously re-elected Tuesday morning by acclamation, as both the Democratic caucus and Republican conference held private meetings on Capitol Hill to select leadership for the next Congress. The handful of new senators-elect, who have yet to be sworn in, were also on hand to participate in the process. “A few weeks ago, someone called him the Apex Predator of American politics, which may be the best yet,” Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said in remarks formally nominating Mr. McConnell, the longest serving Republican leader in the Senate’s history. “I nominate as our leader, the Apex Predator of the United States Senate, Addison Mitchell McConnell Jr.” Very little upheaval was expected on either side, with Senate Democrats maintaining the same leadership team and Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois remaining as the No. 2 Democrat, according to a Democrat familiar with the results. The caucus also agreed to add two senators, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, expanding the Democratic leadership ranks to 10 members besides Mr. Schumer and Mr. Durbin. The caucus will wait until later in the year to decide committee assignments and who will oversee the Senate Democratic campaign arm. Senate Republicans kept Senator John Thune of South Dakota as the conference whip, the No. 2 position, as well as Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, Joni Ernst of Iowa, and Roy Blunt of Missouri in top positions. They elected Senator Rick Scott of Florida, the state’s former governor, to lead Senate Republicans’ campaign arm. “We’re ready to get going even though there is some suspense about whether we will be in the majority or not. That will be answered in Georgia on Jan. 5,” Mr. McConnell said. Pressed by reporters, he once again declined to recognize President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory and insisted President Trump’s decision to challenge the results by spreading baseless claims of widespread fraud “should not be alarming.” — Emily Cochrane and Nicholas Fandos President Trump’s iron grip on his party has inspired love for him among some Republican lawmakers and fear among others. Neither group will tell him it is time to concede his loss —  or at the very least, to stop spreading claims about the integrity of the nation’s elections that are contrary to considerable evidence. The dynamic helps explain why, days after Joseph R. Biden Jr. was declared the winner of the election, even Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, was unwilling to recognize the result. Instead, senators have tiptoed around — or in some cases blindly run past — the reality of Mr. Trump’s loss, and the lack of evidence to suggest widespread election fraud or improprieties that could reverse that result. By Monday evening, only a few Republican senators known for their distaste for Mr. Trump — Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — had acknowledged Mr. Biden’s victory. The Republican House leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, insisted that Mr. Trump was right to contest the results of the election. “Every legal challenge must be heard,” Mr. McCarthy said. “Then and only then does America decide who won the race.” Thirty-one former Republican members of Congress — many of them outspoken critics of the president — on Monday denounced Mr. Trump’s allegations in an open letter that called on him to accept the election results. — Catie Edmondson  President Trump’s refusal to concede the election to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has already affected Mr. Biden’s transition, particularly on national security issues. Mr. Biden has yet to receive a presidential daily briefing, the compendium of the government’s latest secrets and best intelligence insights. And while no law states that Mr. Biden must receive it, previous administrations, dating to at least 1968, have authorized their elected successors to be given the briefing after clinching victory. It was also unclear whether Mr. Biden’s team would have access to classified information, the most important pipeline for them to learn about the threats facing the United States. Like previous presidents-elect, Mr. Biden is receiving Secret Service protection, and a no-fly zone has been established over his home in Delaware. But if Mr. Trump’s administration continues its refusal to recognize Mr. Biden as the winner, it could complicate his security until his inauguration. Former agency officials say the Secret Service is highly unlikely to begin that transition unless the G.S.A. has authorized it. — Michael S. Schmidt, Julian E. Barnes and Zolan Kanno-Youngs A Trump loyalist has been appointed as the top lawyer at the National Security Agency, a sign that the administration is trying to help its political appointees land career posts that they can stay in even after a new president is sworn in, American officials said. The appointee, Michael Ellis, had served as a National Security Council lawyer and most recently as its senior director for intelligence. Formerly a lawyer for the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, he gained notoriety as one of two White House aides who helped his previous boss, Representative Devin Nunes, gain access to intelligence reports in early 2017 to advance President Trump’s political goals. Mr. Ellis was one of three finalists for the National Security Agency job. He was chosen by the general counsel for the Department of Defense, which the National Security Agency is a part of, after White House officials made clear that Mr. Ellis was their preferred candidate, according to a person briefed on the decision. Mr. Ellis’s appointment was reported earlier by The Washington Post. The two other finalists were the current acting National Security Agency general counsel, Teisha M. Anthony, and the acting general counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Brad Brooker. The position has been vacant since the previous general counsel, Glenn S. Gerstell, stepped down in February. The post is traditionally apolitical; the National Security Agency fiercely guards its reputation of being outside politics, and it is not clear how well a partisan lawyer will sit with the staff. The general counsel job is a Civil Service post, and it would be difficult for President-Elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s administration to remove Mr. Ellis. However, Mr. Ellis could be reassigned to another legal job in the military. The National Security Agency declined to comment, and the National Security Council staff did not return a request for comment. In the summer of 2019, Mr. Ellis was a deputy to John A. Eisenberg, the National Security Council legal adviser. As White House officials raised concerns about the shadow Ukraine policy run by Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Eisenberg regularly consulted Mr. Ellis about what to do. — Julian E. Barnes A week after Election Day, ballots are still being counted in many states. This isn’t unusual. But because so many people voted by mail this year, the process isn’t as far along as it would normally be. Aside from the presidential contest in four states — Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Alaska — two Senate races and about 20 House races were unresolved as of Tuesday morning. That’s in addition to planned runoffs for Georgia’s two Senate seats and a Louisiana House seat in the coming months. These are some of races we’re watching: Alaska: The Republican incumbents Senator Dan Sullivan and Representative Don Young both hold substantial leads. Arizona: Representative Tom O’Halleran, a Democrat, is ahead of his Republican challenger, Tiffany Shedd, by about 12,000 votes. California: Six House races remain uncalled. The closest include one in the San Joaquin Valley, where Representative T.J. Cox, a Democrat, trails former Representative David Valadao, the Republican, by about 4,500 votes, and one north of Los Angeles where Representative Mike Garcia, a Republican, trails Christy Smith, a Democrat, by about 1,000 votes. Illinois: Representative Lauren Underwood, a first-term Democrat, has pulled narrowly ahead of her Republican challenger, Jim Oberweis, in Chicago’s western suburbs. Iowa: One of the nation’s closest House races is in the Second Congressional District, which covers the southeast part of the state. Just 35 votes separate Rita Hart, a Democrat, from Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican. New York: Eight House races, including some that are not close, remain uncalled because New York has been slow to start counting mail ballots. Close ones include the 18th District in New York City’s northern exurbs, where Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat, leads his Republican challenger, Chele Farley, by just over two points, and District 19 in the Hudson Valley, where Representative Antonio Delgado, a first-term Democrat, is narrowly ahead of his Republican challenger, Kyle Van De Water. North Carolina: The Republican Senator Thom Tillis is narrowly ahead of his Democratic challenger, Cal Cunningham. Texas: The 24th Congressional District in the northern suburbs between Fort Worth and Dallas is the last opportunity for Democrats to flip a district in Texas. With 95 percent of estimated votes counted, Beth Van Duyne, a Republican, narrowly leads Candace Valenzuela. Utah: Representative Ben McAdams, a Democrat whose 2018 victory was one of the biggest upsets of the midterms, trails his Republican challenger, Burgess Owens, by less than half a percentage point. Washington: Representative Kim Schrier, a first-term Democrat, leads her Republican challenger, Jesse Jensen, by about 3.5 percentage points in the Eighth District southeast of Seattle. — Maggie Astor The top Justice Department official overseeing election fraud investigations took aim at Attorney General William P. Barr as he abruptly departed from the post, telling colleagues that he stepped aside in an attempt to protect the department’s integrity. Mr. Barr informed federal prosecutors on Monday that they were allowed to investigate “specific allegations” of voter fraud before the results of the presidential race were certified. In explaining his move, the official, Richard Pilger, said that his decision was rooted in an award that he had won several years earlier that recognizes a department official who “displayed extraordinary strength of character in a unique situation.” Mr. Pilger plans to stay at the Justice Department in a nonsupervisory role. Here is the text of the email Mr. Pilger sent to colleagues, absent a redaction: Dear Colleagues, Attached please find the Attorney General’s Memorandum of today entitled “Post-Voting Election Irregularity Inquiries,” an important new policy abrogating the forty-year-old Non-Interference Policy for ballot fraud investigations in the period prior to elections becoming certified and uncontested. Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses, pp. 84-85 (8th Ed. 2017). Having familiarized myself with the new policy and its ramifications, and in accord with the best tradition of the John C. Keeney Award for Exceptional Integrity and Professionalism (my most cherished Departmental recognition), I must regretfully resign from my role as Director of the Election Crimes Branch. I have enjoyed very much working with you for over a decade to aggressively and diligently enforce federal criminal election law, policy, and practice without partisan fear or favor. I thank you for your support in that effort. The Acting Director of the Election Crimes Branch going forward will be PIN Deputy Chief Robert J. Heberle [redacted text]. Deputy Director Sean F. Mulryne will remain in his position. Please give them both the same support that I have enjoyed, and rest assured that he Public Integrity Section remains committed to operating properly in all of its functions. Best Wishes, RCP The department created the John C. Keeney Award for Exceptional Integrity and Professionalism a decade ago to recognize department officials who showed integrity over a long career and “displayed extraordinary strength of character in a unique situation.” Mr. Keeney was the longest-tenured department prosecutor in history. He worked under 12 presidents and 23 attorneys general over 60 years, according to the Justice Department. He retired in 2010 as a top official in the department’s criminal division in Washington. During World War II, Mr. Keeney was shot down during an allied bombing campaign over Germany and held in a Nazi camp until the conclusion of the war. Six years later, he was hired by the Justice Department as a prosecutor. Early Tuesday, the top lawyer for the Biden campaign joined the chorus of Democrats and civil rights lawyers condemning Mr. Barr’s decision. “It is deeply unfortunate that the Attorney General Barr chose to issue a memorandum that will only fuel the ‘specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims’ he professes to guard against,” said the Biden lawyer, Bob Bauer. “Those are the very kind of claims that the president and his lawyers are making unsuccessfully every day, as their lawsuits are laughed out of one court after another.” — Michael S. Schmidt and Katie Benner Providing another example of how President Trump’s reaction to his election loss differs from other presidents’, Hillary Clinton on Tuesday posted a letter that an outgoing president, George H.W. Bush, wrote to an incoming one, Bill Clinton, in 1993. “You will be our president when you read this note,” Mr. Bush, a Republican and the last incumbent to lose re-election, wrote to Mr. Clinton, his Democratic successor, on Inauguration Day. “Your success is now our country’s success. I am rooting hard for you. Good luck.” “Here’s how it’s done in America,” Mrs. Clinton wrote on Instagram, describing the letter as “gracious.” “Since the very beginning, American presidents have accepted the will of the people and participated in a peaceful transfer of power,” she wrote. “That’s what makes our democracy so unique, and so enduring.” To be fair, Mr. Trump has 71 days to pen a similar note to Mr. Biden. But based on how things are going so far, that gesture appears unlikely. Mr. Trump has shattered Washington’s norms for four years, has yet to concede he lost the election and is stalling the start of a peaceful transition period, breaking from longstanding precedent. Mr. Bush was the last one-term president before Mr. Trump. But the similarities stop there. “Here’s the way we see it and the country should see it — that the people have spoken and we respect the majesty of the democratic system,” Mr. Bush said in the concession speech he delivered on election night in 1992. “I just called Governor Clinton over in Little Rock and offered my congratulations. He did run a strong campaign. I wish him well in the White House.” Transitions have faced roadblocks before. The most recent — in 2016, when Mr. Trump prepared to take over from President Barack Obama — was rocky and behind schedule because of shake-ups on Mr. Trump’s team. Eight years earlier, Mr. Obama’s transition faced snags because he had to replace his head of personnel multiple times. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
