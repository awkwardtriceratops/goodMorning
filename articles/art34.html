RIGHT NOW The Justice Department said it would open a federal civil rights investigation into the shooting.  Wisconsin’s attorney general said late Wednesday that Jacob Blake, a Black man who was shot at seven times by a white police officer in Kenosha, Wis., had acknowledged having a knife “in his possession” when the shooting occurred. The attorney general, Josh Kaul, also said investigators had found a knife on the driver’s side floorboard of Mr. Blake’s car after the shooting and that no other weapons had been recovered from the vehicle. The information about the knife was part of an update that Mr. Kaul provided about the Wisconsin Department of Justice’s investigation into the shooting of Mr. Blake on Sunday, which touched off protests that continued into Wednesday and turned violent at times. In his statement, Mr. Kaul also identified the officer who shot Mr. Blake, 29, as  Rusten Sheskey, a seven-year veteran of the Kenosha police force. Mr. Sheskey has been placed on administrative leave, officials said. Lawyers representing Mr. Blake said the police had been the aggressors. Mr. Blake, the lawyers said, “didn’t harm anyone or pose any threat to the police, yet they shot him seven times in the back in front of his children,” who were in the car at the time of the incident. As to the knife, the lawyers said, “Witnesses confirm that he was not in possession of a knife and didn’t threaten officers in any way.” Mr. Kaul gave the following account of the events leading up to the shooting: Officers answered a report from a woman that “her boyfriend was present and was not supposed to be on the premises.”   After responding to the call, the officers tried to arrest Mr. Blake. It was not clear from Mr. Kaul’s statement what connection, if any, Mr. Blake had to the call that summoned the officers. In the course of confronting Mr. Blake, the officers fired a stun gun at him, but “it was not successful” in stopping him. “Mr. Blake walked his vehicle, opened the driver’s side door and leaned forward,” Mr. Kaul wrote. At that point, Officer Sheskey grabbed Mr. Blake’s shirt and fired his service weapon seven time, including into Mr. Blake’s back. (The Kenosha police do not use body cameras, Mr. Kaul noted.) Mr. Kaul said the Justice Department’s Division of Criminal Investigation planned to report its finding to a prosecutor in 30 days, and that the prosecutor would then determine what charges, if any, would be brought. The Justice Department said on Wednesday that it would open a federal civil rights investigation into Officer Sheskey’s shooting of Mr. Blake. The F.B.I. will conduct the federal inquiry in cooperation with Wisconsin authorities, the department said in a statement. “The federal investigation will run parallel to, and share information with, state authorities to the extent permissible under law,” the department said in its statement. This is the second such investigation for the department this year involving a white police officer and a Black man. In May, the department said it had opened an inquiry into Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer who was videotaped kneeling on the neck of George Floyd during an arrest. Mr. Floyd died a short time later, and the killing touched off protests across the country that have continued throughout the summer. Attorney General William P. Barr said when the investigation into Mr. Chauvin’s conduct was announced that it would proceed quickly. A department spokeswoman said on Wednesday that she had no update to provide. Civil rights advocates, and even some lawyers inside the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, doubt the department will announce a decision or take action in either case before the presidential election, especially given that Mr. Trump has built his re-election campaign in part around his staunch support for law enforcement officers. Criminal charges in either case could alienate Mr. Trump’s supporters, and decisions not to prosecute in either matter could further inflame the social unrest that has swept the country since May. Mr. Barr and other administration officials insist that systemic racism does not exist in the nation’s police forces, and the Justice Department under Mr.  Trump has mostly stopped using consent decrees and other means to investigate, monitor and curb police abuses. Mr. Barr’s supporters say he has successfully pursued cases against police officers in the past. When he was attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, the Justice Department charged four white Los Angeles officers who beat Rodney King, a Black motorist, with violating Mr. King’s civil rights after the state case against them ended in acquittals. Two of the officers were convicted in the federal case.   A 17-year-old from Illinois was arrested and charged on Wednesday after two people were fatally shot during a chaotic night of protests in Kenosha, Wis. The teenager, Kyle Rittenhouse, was arrested in Antioch, Ill., after being charged with first-degree intentional homicide, according to a court document filed in Lake County, Ill. Antioch is about 30 minutes southwest of Kenosha, just over the Illinois line. The deadly shooting erupted amid a third night of unrest in Kenosha, where protesters have flooded the streets to condemn the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man who was paralyzed after a white officer fired at him seven times. The fatal shooting that Mr. Rittenhouse was charged in came as protesters scuffled with a group of men who were carrying guns and saying they wanted to protect Kenosha businesses from looting. A hail of gunfire broke out, along a crowded, dark street, sending bystanders fleeing into parking lots and screaming in terror. The authorities said Mr. Rittenhouse was not a protester but they did not say what he was doing there. The continuing strife in Kenosha prompted Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, a Democrat, to order hundreds of National Guard troops into the city. It also drew the attention President Trump, who is in the third day of the Republican National Convention and has sought to portray jurisdictions run by Democrats as rife with dangers and crime. Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday that he planned to deploy federal law enforcement officials to Kenosha and that Mr. Evers, a Democrat, had agreed to accept the help. Athletes from the N.B.A., W.N.B.A., Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer took their boldest stand yet against systemic racism and police brutality, boycotting games on Wednesday in response to the police shooting of Jacob Blake. The moves dramatically escalated a season of athletes demonstrating for social justice, with some players expressing doubts about continuing to play amid widespread social unrest. The boycotts came after Milwaukee Bucks players refused to come out of the locker room for their N.B.A. playoff game against the Orlando Magic. The league quickly postponed two other playoff games scheduled for Wednesday. Players in other leagues soon followed the N.B.A. players’ lead, with numerous professional basketball, baseball and soccer games called off as a result. N.B.A. and the W.N.B.A. players have long been at the forefront of protests in the sports world. But they went even further this year after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and as leagues took an extended hiatus because of the coronavirus pandemic. Still, the Bucks’ boycott escalated the athletes’ demonstrations to new heights. Since Blake was shot, many N.B.A. players have openly debated the wisdom of continuing to play, questioning whether the platform provided by the league’s return was amplifying their message or taking attention from the broader social justice movement. LeBron James, the N.B.A.’s biggest superstar, appeared to capture the mood of many players with a blunt message posted on Twitter. “WE DEMAND CHANGE,” he wrote. “SICK OF IT.” John Geraghty, who works in a tractor factory, had barely paid attention to the presidential race or the conventions. But when he awoke Monday to images of his hometown, Kenosha, Wis., in flames, he could not stop watching. The unrest in places like Portland, Ore., and Minneapolis had arrived at his doorstep, after a white police officer shot a Black man several times on Sunday And after feeling “100 percent on the fence” about who he would vote for in November, Mr. Geraghty, 41, said he was increasingly nervous that Democratic state leaders seemed unable to contain the spiraling crisis. “We have to have a serious conversation about what are we going to do about it,” he said. “It doesn’t seem like the powers that be want to do much.” The politically calculated warnings of President Trump and the Republican Party about chaos enveloping America should Democrats win in November are reverberating among some people in Kenosha, a small city in one of the most critical states in this year’s election. While many demonstrators have been peaceful, some people have set fire to buildings. At least four businesses downtown have been looted. Men armed with guns have shown up to confront protesters, and three people have been shot, two of them fatally.  On Wednesday, a white teenager from Illinois, Kyle Rittenhouse, was arrested in the shooting. In Kenosha County, which Mr. Trump won by fewer than 20 votes in 2016, those who already supported him said in interviews that the events of the past few days had reinforced their decision to do so. Some wavering voters said the chaos in Kenosha and the inability of elected leaders to stop it were nudging them toward the Republicans. And some local Democrats expressed concern  that what was happening aid the president’s re-election’s prospects. As Mr. Trump seized on the chaos in Kenosha as an example of what he says will happen across the United States if he is not re-elected, his opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., condemned what he called the “needless violence” that has roiled the city amid several days of protests. But Mr. Biden, the Democratic nominee, also expressed solidarity with peaceful protesters, denounced systemic racism and said he had spoken with the parents and other relatives of Mr. Blake, a Black man whose shooting by a white police officer touched off the unrest. “I told them justice must and will be done,” Mr. Biden, speaking in a video that was posted on social media, said of his discussions with Mr. Blake’s family members. He also urged those listening to his remarks to “put yourself in the shoes of every Black father and Black mother in this country and ask, ‘Is this what we want America to be?’” Mr. Biden, the Democratic nominee, is confronting competing political pressures. While many Americans, including progressive Democrats, overwhelmingly support protests against racial injustice and police brutality, Mr. Trump has tried to cast his rival as a radical who would diminish or even eliminate police agencies, and unleash a wave of lawlessness. Mr. Biden was emphatic in criticizing those who were not protesting peacefully. “As I said after George Floyd’s murder, protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary,” he said. “Burning down communities is not protest, it’s needless violence. Violence that endangers lives. Violence that guts businesses, and shutters businesses, that serve the community. That’s wrong.” Mr. Biden’s response to the events unfolding in Kenosha is his latest balancing act on  law enforcement matters. His deep involvement in the 1994 crime bill, for example, has earned him skeptics among those who are focused on criminal justice reform. On the flip side, the Trump campaign has repeatedly, and falsely, accused Mr. Biden of seeking to defund the police, a measure that he opposes. Despite being untrue, the claim could hurt him, especially in swing states like Wisconsin, if Republicans are able to make it stick.
