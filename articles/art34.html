Goodbye, Tab: Coca-Cola will discontinue the iconic diet soda. The latest: U.S. manufacturing fell in September. Catch up: How Twitter and Facebook tried to avoid a crisis, and wound up creating another. Eight million Americans have slipped into poverty since May and there are 11 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic. And yet, for the fifth straight month, people continued to pull out their wallets and spend more on cars, sporting goods and clothing. Consumer spending rose 1.9 percent in September, the Commerce Department said on Friday, more than twice the rate of increase that most economists had predicted. Retail sales have fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels and “jump started,” according to one economist, a “nascent economic recovery.” “We thought we would see negative impacts on spending by now, but these are surprisingly strong sales gains,” said Scott Anders, an economist at Bank of the West. “We thought catastrophic joblessness would weigh more on confidence, but it has risen.” These seemingly contradictory trends — recovering consumer spending on the one hand and worsening poverty on the other — partly reflect the inequalities in the American economy that have existed for years, but have been amplified by the pandemic. While millions of Americans have lost their jobs and are struggling to pay their rent and utilities bills, millions of others continue to work remotely, enjoying rising stock market investments, strong home values and low interest rates that are making big purchases like a new car easier. “It is a two-tiered world,” Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global said. The spending power of lower-income Americans had been boosted by the trillions of dollars of stimulus that the federal government has pumped into the economy, boosting household incomes. But economists have been warning for months that most of that money, which came in the form of checks this spring and $600 a week in additional unemployment benefits, has already been spent. “Lower-income households don’t have the spending power that they once had,” Mr. Anderson said. “A lot of them, unfortunately, are getting lost in the shuffle and it is partly what you are seeing in this data.” Strong auto sales were the largest factor behind the spending increase in September. Vehicle sales rose 3.6 percent from August, as more Americans who are forsaking air travel during the pandemic have upgraded their automobiles, or bought a car for the first time. Gasoline sales also increased slightly, suggesting that more people were venturing out as schools, offices and businesses reopened. There were other signs in the data that, even as cases of the coronavirus began to surge across the country last month, people’s shopping habits are returning to some level of normalcy. Sales at clothing and department stores sales rose 11 percent, which some economists attributed to back-to-school spending, which typically happens early in the summer. Sales of health and beauty products, which seemed less necessary in the heart of the lockdowns this spring, increased 1.5 percent. At grocery stores, which had experienced record sales and profits fueled by panic buying at the start of the pandemic, sales were mostly flat. — Michael Corkery and Sapna Maheshwari Financial markets in the United States and Europe rose on Friday, as investors considered a new round of earnings reports and a report on retail sales that was stronger than expected. The S&P 500 rose less than half a percent in early trading. The gains in Europe were sharper, with the Stoxx Europe 600 up more than 1 percent, recovering from a sharp drop the day before. On Wall Street, investors were considering a report from the Commerce Department that showed U.S. consumer spending increased for the fifth straight month in September. The 1.9 percent gain reported was stronger than economists had expected. The British pound gyrated, sharply sinking 0.75 percent before quickly recovering, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government would abandon Brexit talks and proceed without a trade deal on Jan. 1 unless there was a “fundamental change in approach” from the European Union side. Thursday had been Mr. Johnson’s deadline for striking a deal. E.U. negotiators are expected to come to London next week for more talks. Shares in LVMH, the French luxury goods company which owns Louis Vuitton and Givenchy, jumped more than 6 percent after the company said sales in its fashion brands rebounded in the third quarter. Shares in Christian Dior, also controlled by LVMH, rose 8 percent. Shares in the British luxury brand Burberry climbed more than 3 percent. Daimler, the German manufacturer of Mercedes-Benz, said its third-quarter performance had been better than expected with a pretax profit of 3.1 billion euros. The automaker’s shares rose 5 percent. A European aviation regulator told Bloomberg News that he was satisfied with upgrades to the Boeing 737 Max, increasing the chances the plane could return to the region’s skies by the end of the year. Final approval in Europe requires several more steps, but Boeing’s shares rose nearly 5 percent. — Eshe Nelson The Coca-Cola Company is discontinuing Tab, its first diet soda brand that became a cultural icon in the 1970s and retains a small but loyal cult following to this day. For years, rumors have circulated that the soda giant was planning to end the brand, which was introduced in 1963. The possibility of its demise had prompted Tab’s most devoted fans — who call themselves Tabaholics — to reach out to the company to complain and even sign petitions demanding that Coca-Cola keep Tab alive. But this time, it’s really over: Tab is going away amid an effort by Coca-Cola to “retire select underperforming products” by the end of this year, the company announced on Friday. Coca-Cola said that plans to streamline the company’s beverage brands were “underway well before the coronavirus outbreak,” but that supply chain disruptions and changing consumer behavior caused by the pandemic prompted the company to speed up its efforts. Coca-Cola is just one of many major food, beverage and retail brands feeling the impact of the pandemic. Some fast food chains, including California Pizza Kitchen and Ruby Tuesday, have filed for bankruptcy during the crisis, along with retail brands including J. Crew, Men’s Wearhouse, and Lord & Taylor. Other companies have also taken creative approaches to marketing during the pandemic, with PepsiCo recently releasing a new beverage, Driftwell, to help people de-stress and unwind before bed. Other outgoing products from Coca-Cola include Odwalla, Coca-Cola Life, Diet Coke Fiesty Cherry and Sprite Lymonade, as well as regional beverage brands such as Northern Neck Ginger Ale and Delaware Punch. “It’s about continuing to follow the consumer and being very intentional in deciding which of our brands are most deserving of our investments and resources, and also taking the tough but important steps to identify those products that are losing relevance and therefore should exit the portfolio,” Cath Coetzer, global head of innovation and marketing operations for The Coca-Cola Company, said in a statement. Tab was initially marketed to women with the message that the zero-calorie beverage would keep their waistlines trim. The brand reached its cultural height in the 1980s, when commercials featured bikini-clad women with a jingle proclaiming that Tab was “for beautiful people.” But in 1982, Coca-Cola introduced Diet Coke, and by 2011, only three million cases of Tab were produced, compared with 885 million cases of Diet Coke. — Gillian Friedman There was one major talking point this week for executives on earnings calls and in media appearances: the stalled negotiations over another pandemic stimulus bill. “The medium to longer term is still highly uncertain in particular as it relates to future stimulus. And so we remain heavily weighted to our downside scenarios.” — Jennifer Piepszak, the chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase “The pace of job growth and the rebound in consumer spending have slowed, and the diminished pace of reopening and the end of some stimulus programs are presenting headwinds.” — Charles Scharf, Wells Fargo’s chief executive “There is talk of another stimulus in terms of its impact. We’ve assumed that kind of a bit later, in terms of in the first quarter of 2021.” — Mark Mason, the chief financial officer of Citigroup “For both sides, I think what they need to keep in mind is that there are Americans that need them, that don’t really care about politics, aren’t really tied up in this election and they just need some help.” — Doug McMillon, Walmart’s chief executive, on CNBC “The consumer number in my view is going to be highly dependent on whether they provide more fiscal stimulus, which I think they absolutely need to do.” — William Demchak, the chief executive of PNC Financial Services — Jason Karaian Many companies do not expect their workers to return to offices until next summer, and even then things may never be the same as before, judging by the comments executives made this week, highlighted in today’s DealBook newsletter. On earnings calls, executives from Goldman Sachs said that about a third of workers in New York and London were coming in regularly; at JPMorgan Chase, it’s around 20 percent in both cities; and Citigroup said “a small percentage” of employees in North America had returned. “Being together enables greater collaboration, which is key to our culture,” said David M. Solomon, Goldman’s chief. But Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan acknowledged that some working habits may have changed permanently, which “will ultimately reduce the space you need for your employees.” Terrance R. Dolan, the finance chief at U.S. Bancorp, told analysts that the bank will most likely “consolidate” its corporate real estate to reflect “the new horizon.” Is that a problem? Steven J. Goulart, the chief investment officer at MetLife, said at a regulatory round table that the “pressure to de-densify” offices to support social distancing could support demand for real estate even if buildings aren’t as full as before. And as executives conduct more business remotely, going back to in-person meetings and pitches seems less urgent. Natarajan Chandrasekaran, the chairman of Indian conglomerate Tata Sons, said in an interview with The New York Times that he used to fly from India to the United States to pitch a $50,000 project. But recently, he said, his firm’s consultancy business closed $2 billion worth of deals in “five or six Zoom calls.” There are other perks from working at home. BlackRock’s Laurence D. Fink is excited about what employees could do with the time they save on daily commutes. “They could spend two hours improving their health by exercising,” he said on a conference call. “They could spend two hours more in building a deeper, stronger, more resilient family.” Paul Draovitch of Duke Energy said at an investor event that working from home was “not without risks,” but also brought certain benefits: “When my Pomeranians walk into the room, it's really a pleasure.” Ephrat Livni contributed reporting — Lauren Hirsch U.S. industrial production declined in September by 0.6 percent, the Federal Reserve reported, another indicator of a faltering recovery. After surging in June and July, industrial output barely rose in August. Production of consumer goods fell 1.6 percent in September, including a decline of more than 4 percent in automotive output. Over all, manufacturing decreased by 0.3 percent and was 6.4 percent below the February level. A British regulator said on Friday it had fined British Airways 20 million pounds, or $25.9 million, for lax security that led to a data breach in 2018, in which hackers stole data of more than 400,000 British Airways customers. The fine is much less than the £183 million originally suggested in 2019. Facebook and Twitter limited or blocked the distribution of an unsubstantiated New York Post article about Hunter Biden, the son of the Democratic presidential nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr. Twitter has since changed the policy that it had used to block the article, saying on Thursday that it would allow similar content to be shared. But both companies drew a furious response and accusations of censorship from Republican lawmakers, including President Trump. The New York Times’s tech reporters and columnists have been covering the developments as they unfold: Twitter and Facebook’s actions offer a glimpse at how online conversations could go awry on Election Day. And Twitter’s bob-and-weave in particular underlined how the companies have little handle on how to consistently enforce what they will allow on their sites, Mike Isaac and Kate Conger write. To many Democrats, the unsubstantiated article — which included a bizarre set of details involving a Delaware computer repair shop, the F.B.I. and Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer — smelled suspiciously like the result of a hack-and-leak operation, The New York Times’s technology columnist Kevin Roose says. YouTube has managed to avoid the controversy entirely, because it isn’t clear what — if anything — that platform is doing about the story, reports Daisuke Wakabayashi. The Federal Reserve, which set up a variety of programs to keep credit flowing in the midst of the pandemic recession, should stop making corporate bond purchases, the congressional commission tasked with overseeing the central bank’s emergency lending efforts said in a new report. The program, which is backed with money from the Treasury Department, was set up to buy corporate bonds — first through exchange-traded funds and more recently as part of an index that it created. Through Oct. 8, the facility had bought $13.1 billion in funds and individual bonds, the report said. The program has drawn criticism for making it easier for a broad array of companies to borrow money at very low rates, although doing so has helped many raise funds needed to weather the pandemic. Most of the benefit to corporations has come indirectly — as a result of the Fed’s presence as a backstop, not because of the purchases themselves — but critics have also said that the programs should have more strings attached. Actual purchases in the program had already slowed to a trickle thanks to calm market conditions, but the commission said it “has concluded that the facility should stop making any purchases.” The oversight committee, a group of two Democrats and two Republicans, also reported the results of a hearing on the Fed’s effort to buy state and local debt — a program that has seen limited use because of its relatively high interest rates and what borrowers call ungenerous terms. The Republicans on the committee felt that the program had “achieved its purpose of restoring liquidity in the municipal bond market.” But the Democrats felt that it should be more generous. They argued that it should reduce the interest rate charged so that the municipal program was “at least as generous with state and local governments as it is with borrowers participating in its other emergency lending programs.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
