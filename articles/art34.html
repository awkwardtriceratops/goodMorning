The pay-per-view, which carries a price tag of $49.99, is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. Eastern time. There are seven scheduled bouts, split into a main card and an undercard. Tyson vs. Jones, heavyweight, eight rounds The YouTube star Jake Paul vs. the former N.B.A. player Nate Robinson, cruiserweight, six rounds Badou Jack, a former supermiddleweight and light heavyweight champion, vs. Blake McKernan, light heavyweight, eight rounds Jamaine Ortiz vs. Sulaiman Segawa, lightweight, eight rounds Irvin Gonzalez Jr. vs. Edward Vasquez, featherweight, eight rounds Juiseppe Cusumano vs. Greg Corbin, heavyweight, eight rounds. There are also promised musical performances by Lil Wayne, French Montana, Wiz Khalifa and YG, with Ne-Yo performing the national anthem. One scheduled bout, between Hasim Rahman Jr. and Rashad Coulter, was canceled because Rahman tested positive for the coronavirus. By Oskar Garcia The first fight on the main card, between Hasim Rahman Jr. and Rashad Coulter, was canceled because Rahman tested positive for the coronavirus. Rahman apologized to his fans on Twitter and said he had been looking forward to showcasing his talents on a big stage. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs devastating news that I won‚Äôt be able to compete, but my health is first and foremost,‚Äù he said. üôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæ pic.twitter.com/Sp6R5GAajg Coulter, a former U.F.C. fighter, said he hoped to fight Rahman down the line. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about your positive test my friend,‚Äù Coulter said before adding that he wanted to prove Rahman wrong for his opinion that mixed martial arts have difficulty boxing. I'm sorry about your positive test my friend, BUT I'm going to hold you to these words. I will show every boxer "UFC FIGHTERS" know how to box. Lets go.. https://t.co/ve82QyO0DJ  By Morgan Campbell The promoters proclaimed recently that Tyson-Jones had broken presale records at FITE.tv, the event‚Äôs online pay-per-view partner. Without numbers or comparison points, it is impossible to know what it means to break FITE.tv‚Äôs pay-per-view presale record. But we know that Tyson, a big draw in his late-1980s heyday, remains popular as an all-purpose celebrity in 2020. Novelty bouts like this happen periodically, often attracting a large audience. And they nearly always prompt questions about what it means for the boxing industry when a farcical fight outdraws legitimate, high-level matchups, like Terence Crawford‚Äôs dominating knockout of Kell Brook on ESPN earlier this month. The answer to that question is that it means nothing. Boxing is a niche sport with a reliable TV audience of one million to 1.3 million viewers for title fights on cable. That number hasn‚Äôt budged for years. Novelty fights appeal to a broader audience by matching people who are famous for something besides boxing. Full-time fighters on the undercard might win some new fans among the drive-by viewers tuning in to watch Tyson, Jones, Paul or Robinson, and those fights won‚Äôt drain fans from Teofimo Lopez, Tyson Fury or anybody else near the top of boxing‚Äôs pound-for-pound list. By Morgan Campbell They‚Äôre all real in that they involve two people punching each other. Whether any of these bouts is in the context of serious competition and the sport at large is a different question. This card is being sanctioned by the California State Athletic Commission. Every bout besides the Tyson-Jones main event will appear on fighters‚Äô records. And every bout ‚Äî except the cofeature, between Jake Paul and Nate Robinson ‚Äî involves full-time professional boxers. The biggest name not in the two featured events is Badou Jack, a former world champion at 168 and 175 pounds who has headlined cards in Las Vegas, New York and Toronto. He‚Äôll face a 33-year-old prospect named Blake McKernan. The lightweights Jamaine Ortiz (13-0) and Sulaiman Segawa (13-2-1) will fight for a regional title, as will the featherweights Irvin Gonzalez Jr. (14-2) and Edward Vazquez (8-0). They‚Äôre the kind of fights you‚Äôd see on the undercard of a midweek show on cable ‚Äî meaningful to the competitors but not big enough to cause a ripple in the broader sports world. By Morgan Campbell The website for this fight card is TysonOnTriller.com, and it is not an accident that Triller, a TikTok-style app where users post quick-hit videos, has its fingerprints all over this event. Before Triller embarked on a spending spree to bring internet-famous content creators to the platform or faced reported allegations of inflating download and user stats, it had Tyson under contract and a plan to promote and broadcast this exhibition. Will Saturday‚Äôs fights help Triller challenge TikTok as the it app for posting short, edited videos? It‚Äôs hard to tell, but the tactic isn‚Äôt new. Before Triller took on TikTok, Shots tried to go head-to-head with Instagram. Shots, you probably don‚Äôt remember, was a photo-posting app backed by Floyd Mayweather and Justin Bieber. It was similar to Instagram except that it didn‚Äôt allow comments on posts ‚Äî only likes. Mayweather would use it to break news of coming fights, urging his followers on other platforms to download Shots for major announcements. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
