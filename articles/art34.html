Thank you so much. Now, here’s the way I see it. Here’s the way we see it, and the country should see it, that the people have spoken and we respect the majesty of the democratic system. [MUSIC] I just called Governor Clinton over in Little Rock and offered my congratulations. He did run a strong campaign. I wish him well in the White House. Senator Obama and I have had and argued our differences and he has prevailed. No doubt, many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country. And I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face. I urge all Americans — [APPLAUSE] — to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our goodwill and earnest effort to find ways to come together.
