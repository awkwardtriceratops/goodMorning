In 90 minutes, President Trump made 131 false or inaccurate statements. By Linda Qiu and Michael D. Shear Thank you very — this is great. Hello. How are you? Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. And hello, Janesville and hello, Wisconsin. We love Wisconsin. Look at this crowd. This is massive. But, you know, we're having massive crowds all over the place and I'll tell you what you know, and I look at a poll we're even in Wisconsin. I don't think so. With what I've done for you. USMCA. We got rid of those horrible — you know, you were being charged 287 percent tariff to do business with Canada. I heard about that. I didn't like that. Your specialty milk people got me. Do you believe it? Special — it was all about specialty milk. That was like the straw that broke the camel's back. I said, "What do you mean?" "Yes, sir. They're charging us 287 percent." And I said, "No, they're not any longer." And we knocked the hell out of it, and we got the brand-new USMCA. And sleepy Joe can't do that. It's not in his vocabulary that I — he has no idea what we just said. He's sitting in his basement right now watching us. He has no idea. And I hate to do this to you, I was having a great hair day, and then I heard you had 40 mile an hour winds I'm looking, and I said, all right, give me the cap. I don't do it often, but now I'm looking at that beautiful site. Is that beautiful? Now as beautiful as that is OSHA — as beautiful as that is, I don't know that I'd want to be those people right in that little corner. Look at that. You know, I think it's magnificent, but I'd get out of there. But they have no fear, do you? You have confidence in Trump. Yeah. We get good equipment. Good equipment. It's great to be back in Wisconsin with thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. Thank you very much. It's a great honor. It's a great honor and we're doing great. We're doing really well. I wish you'd have a Republican governor because, frankly, you got to open your state up. You got to open it up. You got to open it up. Get back to school. I'll tell you what, you know, we had a little problem in Florida. We had a surge and then it went away and they opened it. But we had a problem. Big problem in Texas. We had a surge. They opened it up. It's all opened up. Arizona, they had a surge. It's all opened up and our country is opening. And I'll tell you what, when you look at our numbers compared to what's going on in Europe and other places, but we're doing well. We're going to have one of the best economic years we've ever had next year, one of the best we've ever had. With 17 days from now, we're going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win four more years in the White House. And by the way, early voting begins on Tuesday. So get out and vote. Okay? Now, we've had great success in your state, and I've been very good to you likewise with the ships, you build good ships. You know that, right? A lot of other states wanted that contract. I probably lost some states because of it but we gave you the big contract. And honestly, I went to the yards. It's incredible what you do. This is the most important election in the history of our country. And you know, six months ago, I was saying, well, you know, how do you compare with the last one? I don't know. That was important. The fact is this is the single most important election in the history of our country And Sleepy Joe Biden's made a corrupt bargain in exchange — you saw the bargaining made in exchange for his party's nomination, which he shouldn't have gotten because if Pocahontas got out one day early I'd be running against Crazy Bernie, which would have been okay, too. I would have had a small but energized base. Now we have a little bit larger base to run against, but there's zero energy. They're reporting on it. We've got the most energy in the history of politics and he's got the least. The most in the history, and Biden handed control of his party over to hardcore militant left. The Democrat Party you once knew no longer exists. It's now a party of socialists and Marxists and left-wing extremists. If Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists are elected, and I've always said our country will never be a socialist country. They would kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments and you have a lot of great law enforcement people here today. Thank you. Thank you. I think we have every single law enforcement group in the country has endorsed us, even New York City's finest. You know, they endorsed us, first time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate; it's big stuff. Chicago, Florida, Ohio. Everybody's endorsed us, and I said during the debate, I said, "Joe, name one group, law enforcement, that's endorsed you. Name one." And he was starting — he couldn't breathe and then Chris Wallace bailed him out. And I said, "Joe, say the words 'law and order,' say them Joe," and he wouldn't do it. I said, "Say the words, 'law and order,'" then Chris Wallace bailed him out again. But he can't because if he says law and order, that means he loses the radical left. You know which I think he's losing anyway, but they want to dissolve your borders, raise your taxes, destroy your suburbs. Oh, have I saved your suburbs? The women, you know, they keep telling me about suburban women. I think suburban women like me. I've only saved your house and frankly, I've saved your way of life. I've saved the American Dream, but they keep saying Trump has a problem. Well, they — last time they said the same thing. It was even worse. They said I had a problem with women, period. And then the night that beautiful night four years ago — was that the greatest of all time? It was probably the greatest night in the history of television, right? That was — we had so much fun. The tears that were flowing out of —remember the tears from the totally non-biased anchors. We have another one of them coming up next week. You know Kristen Welker? She deleted her entire account. I wonder why; I can't imagine. You know, I've known her for a long time. She is extraordinarily unfair. But that's all right. We did very well the other night with the person I knew was even more unfair. Savannah. In fact, nobody has seen Savannah for two days. What happened to Savannah? What happened to Savannah? They said, “We'd like to give Savannah Guthrie.” I said, “That's alright. What difference does it make? They ask you a question, you give him an answer, right? It doesn't matter. But she was sort of jumping out of her seat. She was like flying for. She was like, “I told you. I told you.” I said, “I don't care what you told me.” What does that mean? No, but we actually got A+ marks on that. But it was very unfair. And then you watch Sleepy Joe get interviewed by George Stephanopoulos. Nice guy, but he's a tough guy, and he's tough. I interviewed with him two weeks ago, he was tough. He's given, like these lobs, like this in slow-motion lobs. No, it's unfair. But you know what? It's so unfair and we're president and they're not, right? That's how unfair it is. We're — we're. But they want to fund extreme late-term abortion. They want a pack – Well, you got to get out and vote. You got to get out and vote. Got to get out and vote. They want to pack the Supreme Court. You know what that is? They could end up with 16, 19, 20. They want to put far-left judges on the court. They're going to pick people so far left, and you'll end up with far-left justices like we've never had ever before. And our Supreme Court, instead of being what it is now, revered, will end up being nothing. And they want to protect criminals and disarmed law-abiding Americans. They want to take away your Second Amendment. If Biden wins the lawless demonstrators in our streets and you see them all the time, they're Democratic-run. You know, I always say Democrat. You know why? Because it sounds worse. They should actually change their name to the Democratic — Democrat sounds lousy but you know what? That's actually their name. The Democrat Party, right? The Democrat Party. So I always say, "Democrat," they say, "Democratic," I said, "Why don't you try changing your name officially?” But the lawless demonstrators and they are, they're all Democrat-run cities and states, almost every single one of them, and they don't want to really take care of it. They don't want to take care of law enforcement. They want to cut — you see what's going on in Seattle. First of all, the police who we love, they're all quitting. They're all leaving. And they'd still be occupying Seattle, except they found out that we were going in the morning that they all raised their hands. The reason they raised their hands is we were going in that morning. We're going to take over. Can you believe it? We're going to take over the section — the large section of Seattle that these anarchists had — they're anarchists. That's all they are. But, you know, in theory — Law and order is right. In theory, we have to be asked. We have to be asked to do it. The federal government has to be asked. But we went into Minneapolis and you know what happened? How long did that take? About 30 minutes. Remember, they formed a line. They formed another line. They were not socially distanced, which is very bad, in fact, we — they were very close. They had the world's most expensive uniforms on, they had helmets that cost a fortune. There was more computer stuff going on in those helmets. But, you know, under the helmets, great brains, and I'll — and tough. And they formed those lines. And then they said, “Okay, let's go.” This is after two weeks of destruction in Minneapolis. That's why we're going to win Minnesota for the first time since 1972, Republican Party. We're going to win. Now it doesn't hurt that in Minnesota they have Ilhan Omar, who hates your country, who has broken the law, I mean she's broken the law. Let's see what happens. But she's broken the law. But she hates our country. No, we're going to We're going to win because of what we did with Minneapolis. We saved Minneapolis and we saved Seattle. I mean Seattle was going real bad and all we want to — do you want to know the truth, sort of saving the whole country if you really think about it. And that's why we have spirit, the likes of which I don't think any campaign has ever had. That's what's happened. That's what's happened. You know something? I just left Michigan. You know that. Look forward to coming over here, but I just left and the early voting is going big. It should. It should go like it's supposed to go, like 70 percent, 80 percent to the Democrats and then we come in with the big, red wave. It's going to be a wave like nobody's ever seen, because our people want to get out and vote so they'll start big, heavy when it gets, you know, the early voting but especially on that November 3rd day, we're going to swamping it. But here's what happened, and this is early, so this is early, but, you know, still hundreds of thousands of votes. Here's what happened. So we're supposed to be down, you know, big. And then we catch it like a race horse, a race horse. Secretariat would start off and (INAUDIBLE). Well, that was what was supposed to sort of happened and then you see what happens in the end. And I think we win. But something strange has happened in Michigan. You know, we brought back many car plants. Many, many. They hadn't brought back a plant, I think, it's 42 years and we brought back many and expansion of the car plants. So in Michigan, a strange thing has happened. We're leading substantially in the early voting. What's that all about? What is that all about? Because something's happening out there. Look, I mean, take a look at this crowd. You can't see it, as far as the eye can see you have people. As far as the eye can see. This election day the people of Wisconsin and you know what? We win Wisconsin, we win the whole ball game. I mean, what the hell do you think I'm doing here in a freezing night with 45 degree winds? What do you think? Think I'm doing this for my health? I'm not doing this for my health. I'm doing it for that. And I'm doing it for that. How beautiful that is. Wow. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. But this election day, the people of Wisconsin must stop these anti-American radicals by issuing sleepy Joe Biden — he has no clue anyway, Look, let's not kid ourselves. Let's not kid ourselves. He's shot. Okay? I don't care. Think of it. Think of it because this puts pressure on you. I am running against, perhaps in the history of presidential politics, the worst candidate. Obama wouldn't even endorse him. They ran together. They went together, eight years. And then even after he won, I didn't think Obama —it took so long. Right? And now I heard today they said, “Sir.” “What?” “We have a little problem.” “What?” “Obama is going to campaign for him.” I said, "Well, that's good news." He campaigned harder than Hillary Clinton did for Hillary and it just made us stronger. I want him to campaign so much. I want him to campaign you know because we're going to do even better. But it is true. By issuing Joe Biden a tremendous defeat at the ballot box — but it's not Joe Biden — remember this: It's a radical-left, sick ideology. Okay? An amazing poll just came out 56 percent of the American people — Gallup poll, right — say that they're better off today than they were four years ago under the Obama-Biden administration and that's a record. That's a record. And think of what we're saying. And by the way, that's a record 56 percent of the people, and that's during — And we're rounding the corner--we got the vaccines, all that. But even without it, we're rounding the corner. You'll see it. We're rounding the corner and we have unbelievable vaccines are unbelievable and frankly, except for a little politics. But we have unbelievable vaccines. They're coming out real soon, and the therapeutics are unbelievable and the cures. Excuse me, I'm here. I didn't feel so good. I'll be honest with you. I hadn't been sick in a long time. I don't have any time to get sick. It's good. You know, if you're busy, you don't get sick because you have no time. You don't think about it. But I wasn't feeling so good. I wasn't feeling like your president has to feel. I wasn't feeling like Superman and all of a sudden, the doctor, we have great doctors. One thing with being president you got more doctors than any human being. I'm lying down on a bed, I got 12 doctors from Johns Hopkins Hospital University. Great people, all great, I mean, talented, great people. And they love their president. They love their country. But I have doctors. They wanted to touch every single part of my body. I said doctor. But I didn't. You know what? I didn't feel great. And there's a drug. It's Regeneron. It's a transfusion. And all I know is the next morning I felt stronger than I've ever — I wanted to get out there, and I want to make new trade deals for your jobs. And I wanted to do a lot of things. We've done a great job, a lot of jobs. They're just a great job. But the most menacing aspect of the Biden-Harris agenda is their attack of law and order. And I was a big part, you know. I came in and I had your sheriff. And what a great guy. Beth, I had your sheriff's endorsement and a lot of other endorsements in Kenosha. You ever hear of a place called Kenosha? Because if I didn't get involved, there would be no Kenosha right now. There would be none and I wish they called earlier. I wish we could have gotten a little bit earlier, but that's OK. And say what you want. I'll tell you what I give your governor credit. Unlike Oregon because we could solve — we could solve Portland in about I'd say 22 minutes. Okay. They're anarchists. They're wise guys. They live in the basement with their parents, not with Joe, but with their parents. Different basement. A different basement. They go home with their parents. But wise guys, right? Antifa radical left. You know, nobody likes to say it. They're Antifa. They're radical left, but they're wise guys. We could solve that in two minutes, but they don't want to do it. At least your governor said, let's go in and let's solve the problem and we solved it. It was late, but better late than never. But we solved and we saved Kenosha. And I want to thank the sheriff and I want to thank the chief. I want to thank all of the law enforcement. I was there. I want to thank the people that were helping rebuild their stores and their businesses. Kenosha. I never thought of Kenosha that it would be an important part of my life, but it did become because that was a terrible scene and it wasn't their fault. It wasn't their fault. But I'll tell you what, your law enforcement did a great job. We did a great job and I want to thank everybody. Involved. Our law enforcement in this country, if you let them do fairly what they do better than anybody in the world, they wouldn't have any problem. They wouldn't have any problem. You look at what's going on in New York under Democrats. You look at what's going on in Chicago under Democrats. Portland, Oakland under Democrats, Baltimore under Democrats. We have a great young congresswoman, hopefully, running in Baltimore. She's going to be fantastic. I hope she gets a shot, Republican. I hope she gets a shot. Today I want to explain to you the threat that their far-left plans pose to the safety of your family, your community and your country. If you give the power to Democrats, the radical left will defund, disband, disarm, and dismantle police departments all across America. Asked if he supports slashing police funding, you saw this last week, he said, "Yes, yes, absolutely, yes." He's honestly — look, he didn't even understand the question, but that's what he said. It's just like fracking, right, he said there'll be no fracking for a year. There'll be no fracking. Then he gets lucky. Elizabeth Warren refuses to get out so Bernie can have the nomination. So Joe lucks into it on a Super Tuesday, and now he's standing in Pennsylvania and they want to frack because they have a million fracking jobs and because we're energy independent and things. So he goes from saying for a year and a half, there will be no fracking. I wanted to put it on the screen, but it was so windy we would have needed, like 15 cranes to hold up the screen. It would have been a giant sail, but we have it, he says no fracking like 18 times. He then becomes the nominee, goes to Pennsylvania, which we're going to win too, he goes to Penn – you know, because — because in Pennsylvania, I know it well, I went to school there, in Pennsylvania they believe in law and order and they believe in energy and they believe in intelligence. Okay, they believe in intelligence, but so he now goes to Pennsylvania. He gets hit hard and he all of the sudden says I never said that; there will be fracking. First of all, always follow with these politicians because, you know, I've only been doing this for a short while. How the hell did I become president, you know? No, I've only been doing it for sure, but one thing I've learned – but I've known politics. I've been dealing on the other side of politics. One thing, it's the first thing they say that always matters. And he said it for a long time, along with everybody else in this party. And there's no way he could not do what he didn't agree to in the first place. So he gets up and he says in Pennsylvania no, no, we will frack, we will frack and the whole place —and not once — all the, you know, the fake news media back there? Nobody said to him — nobody said to him, but for a year and a half, for a year and a half, you said there be no fracking. And now you said they'll be fracking and nobody asked him that question. It's an incredible thing. You know why? Because they're fake news. Only in Wisconsin could this happen. I know you well. As long as I'm president, we will never defund the police. We will strongly defend our police. I will always stand with the heroes of law enforcement. No, I think I'm endorsed by every law enforcement group, all over the country. Beyond the country. I get world endorsements. It's the craziest thing I said. I never knew I was that militant and I'm not militant. You know what? I want common sense. I want people to be safe, right? I want people to be safe. The Biden plan calls for abolishing cash bail. Oh, that's wonderful. You have a murderer, they want to abolish so that people all over — look at what happened to New York. They abolished cash bail. Your crime went up like 200 percent. It's terrible, and it's common sense. It's not like you have to be tough or not tough or — it's common sense. They're going to release 400,000 criminals onto your streets and into your neighborhoods if Crazy Joe becomes the president. It's not even conceivable. No, no running against him, it's put such pressure because I'm running against the worst in the history of presidential and now if I lose — can you imagine if I lose, I will have lost to the worst candidate--the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. If I lose, what do I do? I'd rather run against somebody who's extraordinarily talented. At least this way I could go and lead my life. But we're not going to lose. We're going to win. We're going to win at numbers. We're going to win numbers, right? Now that's why I can't lose. That might be the second most important. You know what the first most important is? Because we're going to make America greater than ever before. That's what the first is. Their plan also includes disarming law-abiding citizens. Namely, taking away your Second Amendment. Think of it while turning the entire country into one giant sanctuary for criminals, illegal aliens, including those charged with rape, assault, murder, killing — — for the entire —the wall is almost built. I am very proud of that because any guy you know, being a developer, you just learn how to do it. But we had an entire very powerful party, that's all they have. They have two things. They have a very powerful Democrat Party that always sticks together. They don't have any of these rebels that we have in the Republican Party call — I call them stupid people. I call them stupid, stupid people because they play right into the hands. But the Democrats really don't have that. They have two things. They stick together like you've never seen. They are smart and they're vicious, like let's impeach him, even though he did nothing wrong, you know, they're vicious, they're vicious. Now what we have is we have much better policies. Like how about we want a strong border? They don't want to have a border. They want to have open borders, right? We don't want sanctuary cities. We don't want to protect criminals. We want jobs. We want low taxes. You know, we have a lot of good things, but I tell the Republicans all the time. A lot of people say I have a lot of influence over the party. You say you've got to get tougher. You got to get--and you know, only fairer but you got to get meaner but you've got to get tougher because they play a tougher game But we had these rebels and all of--you know they think the hot stuff. By the way, they usually end up outside of politics in a very short time. We make sure that. For the entire summer, Biden was silent as radicals, anarchists, arsonists, and vandals rampaged through Democrat-run cities in Minneapolis, Chicago, New York, Seattle, Portland, and other places. Biden called them peaceful protesters. Remember the guy on CNN? He's standing there and he said, “This is a peaceful” — his hand is shaking. This is a peaceful — I have no idea. It's Ali Velshi. You have a really good--Ali Velshi shaved head, right? Shaved his head. I'm thinking about doing that. That way I don't have to worry about that. I don't have to worry. He shaved--no, he shaved it all off. He doesn't have to worry about "How does it look, darling?" "How does it look, First Lady?" "How does it--darling, you're the most handsome president." I said, "First Lady, am I the most handsome president ever?" "Yes, absolutely." I said, "Who could top me while?" She said, "Well, JFK was good looking, but nothing like you. Nothing like you darling." Yeah. Thank you. Now you go home and you'll see this Crazy CNN — fortunately, their ratings are terrible, which is great, but you'll see them say, "Donald Trump said he's better looking than JFK." You'll see they're sick people that got a lot of problems, but fortunately, they're not doing so well. Earlier this month, rioters laid waste to suburban residential neighborhoods just outside of Milwaukee. Biden will appease the rioters and the looters and the anarchists, and I'm having them arrested. You know what we're doing, we're having them arrested. And you know, when they knock down statues, you notice that's very much stopped, certainly with federal statues, a little thing happens. It's amazing how quickly it stuff. They go to jail for a period of 10 years. You know, it's amazing. They were getting all set to take down the incredible statue of Andrew Jackson, right by the White House, right, and I said we can't let that happen and I'll tell you what. The police went out and they charged. It was an incredible thing, you know, because today everyone wants to be so damn politically correct. The police are afraid if they touch somebody or speak to somebody rudely, they'll be destroyed. Their pension will be gone. Their family will be gone. No, we got to protect our--because we've got to take care--they're going to be fair and you're going to have problems and you're going to have mistakes, and people will choke. You know they'll choke. You have a decision to make. They have a quarter of a second sometimes to make and you'll have some bad cops and we got to do something about those bad cops, and that happens. But 99.9--I mean, we have the--they're the most incredible people and they keep us safe, right? They keep, they keep us safe. They keep us safe so we have to take care of them. This year, more than 1,000 law enforcement officers have been viciously attacked. Nobody talks about that. You know, nobody talks about that. Several police officers have been very, very brutally murdered. You saw it a month ago with the two sitting in a car, and it's--I mean, that's just a horrible thing. The anti-police rhetoric of Joe Biden and the Democrat Party is really what causes a lot of this, too. But it puts police officers in harm's way. It really puts them in harm's away. We can't let that happen. Biden referred to police as the enemy. He just referred — the enemy quote, quote the enemy, and vilified them as an oppressive racist force. I mean this guy's gotten just beaten up. He doesn't believe that. I really don't believe —I shouldn't say that, but I don't believe he believes it. Joe's running mate, how do you like her? Did Mike--did Mike Pence do a great job? Did our great vice president do a great job? Never lets you down. It was just too easy. I said, "Mike, that was just too easy." That's not — oh, she was just terrible. She was terrible. I mean, I couldn't believe he picked her, right? I've said it a lot. She treated him worse than anyone there. They have 27 candidates, right, for this job. I could tell him it's not that easy. Oh, don't forget we have done more than any administration in the first three and a half years in the history of our country. We've rebuilt our military. We've cut more regulation than any other administration by a factor of a lot, and we all did this. We have more federal judges by the end of the first term than any other administration. In fact, percentage-wise the only one that has more — there's only one president that has more, there's only one president that has more percentage-wise not the number because we'll have 300 maybe even more than that by the end of the first term but there's only one president that has a higher percentage than I have. Do you know who that is? George Washington. Give him a hat. Give him a make America great again hat. We'll say make America great again hat again again. We made it great again, and now we've got to make it great again because we had to close it up, save two million lives and now we're opening it up and we're doing record numbers and you'll hear. Joe's running mate and America's most liberal senator, Kamala Harris recently urged their supporters to donate to a fund that bailed out the rioters and did so much harm and even physical damage to people but damage in Minneapolis and they want to bail him out of jail. And she was heading up a group to get him out of jail and including a really bad attempted cop killer. He attempted killing a policeman. Thirteen members of Biden's staff donated to the same fund. You know, by the way, they talk about fundraising, right? I'm good at fundraising. I could be the greatest fundraiser in history. I'm the president of the United States. I'm like a really smart guy like you are, but I'll tell you what — well, think of this. Think of this. If I wanted to pick up a phone and call Wall Street, say, the big firms. Say “Yeah, I've got to raise X.” They'll do it, everyone. I mean, it's so easy. It's so easy. I could have more money. The problem is, if you do that, what happens is when they call you in two months, three months, four months because they need something, you got to take their call and you got to do it. So Biden is raising a lot of money because they're promising all these things to all these people. Now, I — I have a much better platform because I am the president, right? I could raise money and then the fake news goes out and says — you know what we're doing? We're doing great in the small donors, the small donors like $61 apiece and stuff. But I could raise more money than anybody in the history of politics. But I don't want to call these people and say do me a favor, the head of Goldman Sachs. I don't want to say do me a favor. All these people, nobody could ever raise money like me. I just don't want to do it because it puts us all — meaning us, I did this for us, not for me. Believe me, I did it for us. I didn't do it for me. I lost a fortune. This job has cost me billions and billions of dollars, billions. They don't like to say that billions of dollars. And yet if a man from Kuwait comes up and stays at one of my hotels for $259.13, takes a room, next day, “Trump takes Arab as a guest in one of hotels.” I mean, you know billions I lost. And that's okay, because I'm doing something that's the most important thing I've ever done. I don't care. They're a lot of rich people around. What the hell difference does it make? But I've lost billions. You know, I never talk about it. They never talk about it. So I get paid, I guess $400,000, $450,000 and I give up my salary. I don't get it. You don't read that — you don't read it because you know what? It's not good for them to say that, but — and I don't talk about it. But tonight I'll talk about it. So I get the highest salary because you're the president and I give it up. I don't take it, so that's nice. But I would say it costs me two, three maybe more billion dollars and all the work — I have good, good kids. They don't do jobs — they don't do. I don't —say you get— can you imagine if they wanted to go to the Middle East and do jobs all over the place? I'd have hotels being built in every city in every country in the world, and I have great kids and they're ambitious kids. They'd like to do it. I say you can't do it and by the way, there's no legal reason you can't do it. But there is a big reason. Psychologically, you cannot go to Saudi Arabia and all these different places that we protect and we do all these things and that buy a lot of our planes and a lot of our everything, you can't allow them. You can't allow them so that's the way it is. But I would be the greatest fundraiser in the history of politics. But if you don't mind, we don't need the money, you know and we won't do it that way. But they're raising a lot of money, and every time I see them raising a lot of money, I say, because I know exactly what's going on — deals are being made, especially when you look at Joe Biden. I mean, look at what's going on with that family. The Democrat Party's war on cops is driving police officers to leave their jobs in record numbers. No one is hurt more by the left-wing crusade against law enforcement than African Americans. They're hurt the most and you look at it and you know it. Last year, and by the way, large percentages of our policemen and women are African Americans. It's the black community. Last year, in just four Democrat-run cities, over 1000 African Americans were murdered as a result of violent crime. This year, murders in Democrat cities have increased by more than 30 percent and we helped them. We helped them. We want to help them. We say call. I say call. They don't want to call. More than half of the victims are African Americans. Joe Biden and the left ignore these American victims. I never will. We're never going to ignore them. We have done more for the black community than any president with the exception of Abraham Lincoln. It's true. It's true. Criminal justice reform. Obama couldn't do it. I don't even think he tried to do it, frankly. But he could have never done it. Bush couldn't do it. None of them could do it. (INAUDIBLE) and it was desperately needed. Criminal justice reform. I did it. Prison reform. We did it. We did things nobody — how about opportunity zones, right? So great for Hispanic. So great for the black community, the jobs. We worked on that with a great senator from South Carolina. Tim Scott. Great senator. Historically black colleges and universities. You went to one, which one did you go to? I love them. Very good. That's a good one. I don't know if I could have gotten in. That's too good. That's too tough. That's a good one, right? That's good. Well, anyway, they have to be happy with me. But listen, so after three years every three years, every year some — a group of like 44 people, 44, 45 they come up, the head people at all of these colleges and they come up and I'd see them and the first year I saw them I thought it was routine and they're up because they needed money for the colleges. I said that's interest — second year, I said, “What are you doing back here? Why are you back?” Say “we have to come every year.” For years and years, decades they've been coming up every year. And then I see them the third year and I say wait a minute, let's get this straight. You mean you come up here every three years to beg for money? He said we beg for money and we feel like beggars. He's one gentleman who's great. He told me exactly those words. He said they make us come back every. Obama never did it. Obama never did it. And I said so wait, here's what we're going to do, we're going to get you long-term funding and here's what I did, I got them more money than they were asking for and now for a 10-year period--and I said the only bad news is I may never see you again. I may never see you again, but we did that for the black community and we did a lot of other things. And I say that nobody has done more for the black community. But with all of that, the biggest thing of all is criminal justice reform. You know about Alice Johnson and we have so many people like Alice. She's an incredible person. Ask yourself this question, do you want to vote for the candidate supported by anti-American rioters or do you want to vote for the candidate supported by so many of our great people and the heroes of law enforcement? And that's — Biden made his speech. I think it was today. I mean, he makes so few of them, I think, you know, he stays in his place in Delaware, and I like Delaware but does he ever leave Delaware? Right. But he made a speech, there was nobody in the audience, and they never say this. They never say it. We come here, take those cameras, and show them please, please. Okay? We come here. No, I'm telling you today I think the camera slipped because in his case they shouldn't show the audience. In our case, they should. And the camera must have slipped and then there was like nobody there. He's speaking and there's nobody there. And I'm saying nobody reports that and he never leaves his little area. And you know, I'll tell you what as president of the United States, I met with Gold Star families the other week I met with — I meet with a lot of people. I cannot — I have an obligation. I can't lock myself into a basement in the White House. I can't lock myself into a beautiful bedroom at the top of the White House. I get where you'd be you know, there's no risk, no nothing. I'm the president of the United States, and I would often say — I would often say I meet people and these are incredible, like the Gold Star families, they lost sons and daughters and husbands in Iraq and Afghanistan and other places. And I can't say I want to cancel the meeting, and I met about 48 families. And, you know, when they come up to you and they're close to you and they were tested and all but you know, there's questions all about everything, right? This is a very difficult situation. And when they come up to you and they want to say my son was so brave and they want to tell you the story, it's amazing. I mean, their son died three or four years ago this is all — in almost all cases, I say, “So tell me what happened.” “Sir. My daughter was a helicopter pilot and she was so good. She was so good, sir. And she was — she was shot down, sir, in Iraq.” And — and then they tell me what happened and how brave and how great. And — and I can't say do me a favor, stand — you just can't do that. And I say — every time I meet with groups of people, it's not all like that. It's also other people and you meet with generals, but I can't cancel — like, cancel culture, you know, they want to cancel everything, right? — I can't cancel these people. I have to take care of our people. And every time I do it, I say, you know, it's risky and sure as hell I caught it and now I guess they say I'm immune. So you could — I'm immune and I got better fast. I got better fast. I can now jump into the audience and give you all a big kiss, the women, and men. I'll even kiss the men. I'll kiss those big, powerful men down there. I won't love it, but I'll kiss. Anyway so no, it's — you know it's an incredible thing, but I have an obligation. I can't say. Somebody said, “Why did you do this? Why did you do this?” I say because these meetings are — it's so important to people and you're the president and I can't do that and what happened? And I always said after I said, boy, that's risky. Probably, I guess. But, you know, whatever it is, and really I got really well taken care of. And I really believe that this therapeutic or this cure. It was incredible. And, you know, we're going to make what I had available to everybody free, free. It's incredible. The antibody. I think the antibody is the best thing. We're going to make it free. So, you know, it's been incredible what we've been able to do. If you support our police, if you stand with the heroes of law enforcement, then you must defeat the Democrats on November 3rd. You have to do it. You have to do it. And by the way, you know, I hate to say it. I got a little briefing. I've been here before, as you know, but I got a little briefing on the area. You know, this is a Democrat area, but it's a Democrat area that really likes Trump a lot. And a lot of us are really great — really great workers and the workers like me, you know who doesn't like me? The heads of the union. They never like me. You know who does like me? The people in the union, they like me. But — but I'll tell you, this is largely, you know, a lot of Democrats and many people in this audience are Democrats, but they're Democrats that are going to vote for Trump. And we do great here. We do great here and I appreciate it. And I take care of our workers and I take care of jobs, and China will not get away with what they got away with. They're not going to get away with it, not going to get away with way. We just finished an incredible trade deal. In fact, two weeks ago, the largest order of corn in the history of our country. The largest order of soybeans in the history. The largest beef order, cattle, the beef order. And there's all of that's good but you know what? Not the same. Does that make sense to you? It doesn't mean what it would have meant had they not put us through — because they stopped it from going into China but they didn't stop it from going to the rest of the world, including our country, Europe, the rest of the world. So — so your Democrats, some of them, by the way — just seriously without a big deal, I'm just curious. Raise your hand if you're a Dem — seriously, this is just — I'm going to do a poll that costs nothing, right? I like these polls that cost nothing. You know, they do a poll, cost a million dollars. They interview, like 12 people, right? Then they wonder why their polls are off, you know. We've interviewed 253 people. They oversample Democrats by 28 percent. “Trump is down five.” I said, yeah, but you're interviewing mostly Democrats. Did you ever see that? I guess there must be a legal reason why they have to put it. But they over sampled by 18, 20, 21 percent. How about last election? So I was down in all nine places that I had to win. That wasn't a good feeling, you know? Wake up, how we doing? “Well, you're down in all nine places.” By the end of the evening, I won all nine places. Think of that. Other than that, they did a great job of polling. They even had me believing it for a while. But what I didn't believe — because we had a lot of spirit four years ago. And by the way, nothing like we have now. This is — this is far greater. This is far greater. You know, this is still 17 days out and, you know, it sounds like very little, but that's a lot. That's a lot. Normally a crowd like this would be like for the night before for a candidate, one time shot. We have this all over. You had to see what we had in Pennsylvania, in Florida. We were in Florida we had, I think, 41,000 people all over. We were in Atlanta. We were in — we just got back from Georgia. I mean, it's like this but the spirit. We have much more spirit now than we ever had four years ago, and we had a record, a record. But you know what? The media is more corrupt and they're worse. The media — it's not really Biden because you know you can't — she was tougher. She was smarter. Look, Hillary was a lot smarter than sleepy Joe. Let's not kid ourselves. She was a better candidate. Well, I don't know. Look, you know, we'll see how it all turns out, right? What's a better candidate, but — but she was much sharper. She was much smarter. But it's not that the media has become crazed and the big tech companies have become crazed. They won't let the fact that we caught him in a total corrupt deal, they won't let the news get out. They won't let— and in all fairness to Fox, I have my own problems with Fox. But at least Fox is letting it out. And I'll tell you who is incredible: a newspaper called The New York Post, the oldest paper in America. It's the fifth-largest paper in America, and they are all into finding out about all of this Joe Biden — forget about the family. Joe Biden. Yeah. I mean, it really is right. It's really corruption. But it's Joe Biden corruption. So we're thrilled to be here with some incredible people. And you're going to be joined by a man. And I mean this too you know, I say all everybody is wonderful and then half the time, you can't stand them. But you got to say, but this guy is wonderful. He's one of the smartest people in the Senate. A lot of people don't know that. See, I know that because I do a lot of very complex things and there aren't a lot of people that understand, but he understands, and nobody understands finance better. But now what he's doing on — he's the Chairman of Homeland Security, what he's doing on corruption is unbelievable. And I am very proud of your state for a lot of reasons but one of the reasons is that you have a senator named Ron Johnson. Where's Ron? Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here, Ron. Would you get him up, please? Get him up. Come on, Ron. I got to get him. He deserves it. He deserves it. Come on, Ron. Come on. Secret Service is worried about — don't worry about it. He is one of the greatest people. He's one of the greatest senators. And I guess you know, whenever the hell you are running, I'll be here for you. I will tell you that. Please say a couple of words. He's a great guy. Don't lose him. Ron, when are you up? Next year? Next time, two years, right? Don't lose him. I'll be here. Ron, I'll be fighting for you. No, he's really a great guy and I'm glad you came up and I'm glad to have you here, Ron. And really, we're very proud of you. We have some warriors with us and people that have been with us through the fake impeachment hoax. That was one of the great hoaxes. And don't forget, we have done — and Ron understands that better than maybe anybody — we've done more in three and half years than any administration, first three and a half years than any administration in the history — He mentions Right to Try. That's where a person is terminally ill and they can't get a medicine that looks real good but it hasn't been approved because it has to go through this long process, which we've cut in half, by the way. But they can't get — so now, they sign a document and, you know, it was very complicated — but not for me, it wasn't complicated. I said you take the liability away but we had problems with the insurance companies because they didn't want — we had problems with, well, everybody, including the country. They don't want to get sued. So people would go all over the world if they had some money. If they didn't have money, they'd go home and they'd just die. And now if we have something that may work, but it's two years away, three years away, they sign just a quick waiver, and we've had a ‘Right to Try.’ And Ron, I don't know if you know the successful, it's been unbelievable. The number of people — this isn't just trying. We have kept people alive and healthy and well and fully recovered. You know, it's a very great thing and I could never understand it because for years I said why wouldn't they give somebody who's terminally ill the drug and because they say we don't want to get sued because they'll get sued. You know, the family will sue or something happens. I mean, I understand it all, but we got it done. They signed a waiver, but we got it done and the effects — and you know what else happened? Side effect, that nobody thought too much about these companies that are trying to prove that their drug works I'll tell you, if it works there, it works everywhere. It's incredible, and they're able to be able to speed it up where they speed them up because we've had some unbelievable stories, one in particular that I know a young lady who spoke at our--at the National Convention, Republican National Convention. But the success rate has been incredible. So I want to thank you for that. You're right. You're one of the real authors of it. We want to also thank Glenn Grothman. Glenn has been incredible. He's been ,from the beginning, by me, and I want to thank you Glenn for what you've done. A young, beautiful gentleman, Bryan Steil. Hi, Brian. What a job he's doing. What a job. This is your deal over here, right? This is good. This is it. Keep him happy. I'll tell you, it's a big future. Thank you very much for being here. And everybody knows Darin LaHood. Darin, thank you. Great job. Warriors. Warriors, you really are. You're all great, Wisconsin. You're producing good in Wisconsin. What can I tell you? The Wisconsin GOP chairman Andrew Hit. Where's Andrew? Thank you, Andrew. How are we doing, Andrew? Going to win the state? Got to win it. We got to win it. By the way. I wanted to say before Ron Johnson interrupted me so who is a Republican here? Just raise your hand. Okay, that's a lot. I — seriously don't worry about your hand. We all love you. Who is a Democrat here? Republicans, you better get out there and win. No and we really do, we appreciate it. We have a lot of them over there, too. We have a lot of Democrats, but we really do appreciate it, you know, because ultimately we're looking for the same thing. We're looking for unity. We're looking for one country and the question was asked a week ago and they said what about bringing the country together because I want that and I said we were there before the China virus hit us. We were there and we were getting calls because the success was bringing us together as a country. We had the greatest employment numbers. We had the greatest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, women, people with a diploma, people without a diploma, people that graduated first in their class at MIT, everybody. Everybody was — we had 160 million people working. We never had anything like it. And I'm telling you, I bet it was true with you guys, we were getting calls from people that you would least suspect and the country is coming together. Then we got hit by the China virus and then it was back to the drawing boards. But the country was coming together and it's going to come together. It's going to be success. And next year we're going to have the most successful year economically, I think that we've ever. I also want to introduce the Republican candidate for Senate from the state of Illinois, Mark Curran. Mark, I heard you were here. Good, good. Good. I like it. That's great. Good luck. I hear you're doing well, Mark. Good luck. Great to have you. Thank you very much. Tell you what, Illinois could use a new governor.That guy doesn't know what's happening. They got to open up that state. They got to open up that state. Kids have to get back to school. You know, Barron had it, right? They said Barron, Barron Trump, my boy, my very tall young boy. He's very tall. But Barron Trump had it. And they said sir, he tested positive and like about nine seconds later, how's Barron doing? Oh, he's all better. No, young people you know they have — we hate to admit it – they have the stronger--they're very strong immune system, incredibly strong. We have to get back to school. Have to get back to school. You watch what happens on November 4th they'll all say, all right now, everybody — they're only doing this for politics, I really believe that. Because they want the numbers to look a bad as possible. So whether it's your state or whether it's an Illinois or whether it's New York or whether it's Michigan — hey, we won the case in Michigan, the courts have now forced her. They said it was unconstitutional what she was doing. The only person in the whole state that was allowed to have fun and go boating and play tennis and do whatever he wanted was the governor's husband, right? Her husband was free to do whatever he wanted, but other than that, it was like a prison she was operating. This election is a choice between a Trump super recovery and a Biden depression, and you know they're going to raise your taxes substantially, like quadruple. He's the only candidate, you know — all my life I've been involved in politics, never from this side but, you know, a few years ago I said, let's give it a shot. But what I've always been about there is the only time, my life, you know, I always heard it was good to cut taxes. I said, how do you say we're giving a massive tax increase to everybody and it's everybody because you know, you're getting thousands of dollars a year from my tax cuts. We gave the greatest, the biggest tax cut in history, and he wants to end the Trump tax cut. Now he's saying well, I won't do that. The same thing, like fracking, you know, I'm going to frack, frack. Okay? He's just changed his mind, but he wants the end it. And don't forget child tax credit. That's $1000 for every child. So he's going to end all that. So he was going to end — we're going to end, he didn't realize that the middle income people are getting a tremendous tax cut, and so and if you add energy to it because they'll drive energy through the roof, you know, they want to end fossil fuel. They're going to end fracking, 100 percent. They're going to end fracking. I mean this guy goes about, we're going to end fracking for a year and a half. Then he lucks out, gets the nomination because Pocahontas refused to do what she should have done if she believes really, in his philosophy of being a socialist, right? And he gets it. And as soon as he gets it he says, no, no, we're going to frack. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. But if you add energy to it right, you add energy we're talking about $6000, $7000, $8000 a family. That's a tremendous amount. There's never been anything like that. So if you vote for me, you'll have the greatest — if he gets in, he's going to raise your taxes like crazy. If he gets in and it's not him again, it's his people that tell them what to do if he gets in you'll have the greatest depression in the history of this country. Your stocks will go to hell. Everyone thinks stocks, oh, it's rich people. Everybody owns stocks. Your 401(K)s — who has a 401(K) here? That's a lot of people. Okay, are you practically at your all-time high, right? Your 401(K)s will be like wastepaper basket stuff. They'll be right there on the floor. You'll have a depression, the likes of which we've never seen, with the possible exception of 1929 because I don't think it gets much worse than that. But you can't do that. You can't let this happen because he'll destroy everything we've done. You know, regulations, we cut more regulations than any administration in history and regulation, maybe more important in terms of jobs and everything than even the biggest tax cut. It's the biggest tax cut in history, and I think the regulation cut, which is more than any president's done no matter they were eight years or, in one case, more. It doesn't matter. Our regulation cutting was the biggest. He wants to put them all back. That means all these companies that moved to America that moved to the United States that came here because of lower taxes because of all of the things that we've done. Used to take 18 to 21 years to get a highway built to get a highway approved. We've got it down to two years, and it may — and let me tell you, it may not make it if it doesn't work environmentally or if it's unsafe, but at least you're going to know. We're trying to get it to one year, by the way, and we're close to getting it. But it used to take, I mean, we have highways, for 20 years, they've been trying to get approvals, and then after that gets approved it's totally different, and it costs hundreds of times more money. If you vote for me, prosperity will surge, normal life will fully resume and the next year will be the greatest year economically in the history of our country. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery with a draconian, unscientific lockdown. I mean, not that you're already in it, and they'll keep Wisconsin locked up, locked down and closed for business. Biden will shut down the country, delay the vaccine and prolong the pandemic, and companies will be afraid to invest in Wisconsin if you have this happen in our country, if you have a Democrat governor, I don't know him but he's a nice guy, probably. But, but I will tell you, companies, big companies, very strong companies, companies like, as an example, Foxconn, they don't want to invest with these people. They don't want to invest. They don't have any security. They don't have any — they don't want to invest. I get in, companies like that will put more money in than they even promised. But they're very concerned. I mean, they have to have the right climate, so we are going to do things with Wisconsin. But we're going to do things with this country like honestly, has never even been done before, and people will come together because of success. So we're delivering a safe vaccine very soon. in a rapid recovery. Biden's plan will crush Wisconsin. My plan will crush the virus and will make Wisconsin greater than ever before. That's what's going to happen; it's going to happen fast. You know, when you have a spike, you have a surge. But, if you remember two months ago, Florida had a big surge, it's now gone. Numbers are very down. It's totally open. Texas had a very big surge, and now it's down. If you look at Arizona, had a big, big surge. Great, all great governors, and it's down. It's down. All low numbers, really low numbers, and you're going to have the same thing. But you got to open up. You got to go open up. Got to get the place going. Joe Biden is the living embodiment of the corrupt political class that enriched itself while draining the economic life and soul from our country. I mean, 47 years, —he says, well, I should have done this or that. I said Joe you were here for 47 years, you never. I always hated what he says, that I should have done something. I said, you know, and he only left a short time ago, wasn't like they were 25 years ago. He's been at a high position for 47 years. I said Joe, you could have done something. For the last 47 years. Joe Biden shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories and you know it very well, you got hit hard here, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless wars that were ridiculous in countries that you've never even heard of. Joe Biden. They're all coming back. They're all coming back. I got a lot of them, most of them are back. Joe Biden is and always has been a corrupt politician. I hate to say it, and the Biden family is a criminal enterprise. It really is. It's a criminal enterprise. To be honest with you he makes crooked Hillary Clinton look like an amateur. And China has already bought and paid for Joe Biden. Let me tell you if Joe Biden became president, China will own this country. China will own — you know, they're paying us billions and billions of dollars a year. I charged them. They never paid us 10 cents. I gave $28 billion to the farmers, many of them right here 28, 12 and 16, two years, I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, "How much have we been targeted for our farmers by China?" He said, "Sir, two years ago, $12 billion, and last year 16. $28 billion." I said, "That's good. We're going to target them." We took $28 billion. We had tens of billions leftover. They went to the treasury, our treasury, by the way, our treasury right into our treasury, not into China's treasury, our treasury. But we had $28 billion that went to the farmers and a lot of you farmers got it. I also cut the tariffs between Canada and what they were doing to you with 287 percent tariffs. So I'm not just running against Biden. I'm running against the left-wing media, the big tech companies. But if you think about, the Democrats and the media are one and the same. When you look at MSDNC and you look at fake news CNN, then you look at the fake New York Times, the failing New York Times and the good news is — look well, I don't even call good news. But when someday I leave, whether it's in four years, eight years, 12 years, 16 years — Now the story tomorrow will be with the fake news, “He is a fascist. He wants to take over again.” No, no. But when at some point I leave, they're all out of business. They're going to go out of business. They're going to go out of business. They know it, too. That's why I expect someday they're going to all get together and say let's endorse him. I mean, you know because he's done a really good job, and they know that. This political class has nothing but disdain for you and for your values. They flood your communities with criminal aliens, drugs and crime while living behind gated compounds and communities. They oppose school choice — so important too, school choice — while sending their families to the best private schools. They attack the Second Amendment while employing armed guards for themselves. They want to get rid of your Second Amendment. It's not going to happen with me, I promise. I don't think they'll get Ron Johnson on their side. Ron, can I have your pledge, please? I will protect. Okay, we got Ron Johnson. Fellas, we have your votes. In 2016 Wisconsin voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment, and you elected an outsider as president to finally put America first. That's what we did. To defend our workers and our national security, I took the toughest ever action to confront China's rampant theft of American jobs. When China targeted us, we targeted them, and it was very simple. And now we're providing all sorts of everything. What we're doing for you. We have $13 billion coming to help our farmers, in addition to all of the money that China paid our farmers, including Wisconsin's incredible dairy farmers. How's the dairy business, right? Anybody here do specialty milk? People don't realize though — specialty milk are very important —is there anybody — it's a very small part, but it was like the straw that broke the camel's back because I met with these guys and what they were doing, ripping you off on the big stuff. Specialty milk and — anybody do specialty milk? It doesn't — you know what it's so small. But when I heard it, it was like 287 percent. Well, those days are over. When the Wisconsin timber industry was threatened, I imposed tariffs on dumped foreign goods and subsidized products, saving your timber jobs and we have a long way to go. We can save a lot more. We got plenty of timber. I always say, Why the hell are we taking it in timber from other countries, we have it all over the place. And if they ever manage their forests in California and other places, you wouldn't have these forest fires. And part of that is cutting wedges. You know, you have to cut wages and all that stuff is so we have so much timber and I don't know, I guess we're just nice people, doing it from other lands, right? But we're doing good with our timber. We saved our timber jobs. If Joe Biden gets in, the radical left will shut down Wisconsin timber production forever. You know, they don't want to let you touch a tree. If you happen to touch a tree, they want to put you in jail for the rest of your life. I also issued brand new regulations to ensure American workers are first in line for jobs. We want American workers to be first in line. Biden will allow his donors to bring in a flood of cheap foreign workers and wipe out your middle class. We don't want that happening. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. Our southern border is so secure. That wall we're doing 10 miles a week and we'll be hitting over 400 miles within a period of a couple of weeks and it will be finished very soon on. By the way, Mexico is paying for the wall. You do know — you know they keep saying so. Finally they said, Well, alright, he's built the wall. Let's not talk about the wall anymore. So now whenever they go, “But Mexico is not” — no, no, Mexico is paying. We're putting a charge at the border on every — Mexico is paying us for the wall. But Mexico has been great to us because they have 27,000 soldiers all along our southern border. And I want to thank the president of Mexico who happens to be a great guy. And they do have a big COVID problem. This is a good time to have a wall because, you know, we have that wall and it is not penetrable. It is just not. Remember they used to talk about we don't need a wall that's obsolete, right? They wanted drones, drones, little drones flying all over. You know what the drones would be good at with cameras on them? So that we could watch all the people pouring into our country. They wanted drones. Remember crying Chuck Schumer? You know Schumer he cries anytime — I've known him all his life. I've never seen him cry. But when he wants to get on camera, he cries so much, crying Chuck, I call him, you know, because he feels so sad. He feels so sorry for people. Don't worry about. He doesn't, but crying Chuck, you understand what I mean? Crying Chuck, what a beauty. Ron, looks like — because not a good guy. But crying Chuck was talking about walls are obsolete. I said walls aren't obsolete. And he said, no, no, we need technology drones. I said drones aren't going to help you other than I mean they're nice. You know, we have all sorts of attachments to the wall. This wall is technologically very advanced and drones are fine, but you’ve got to have a wall. And then I said to a group of people and they thought It was sort of cool. You know, you do a computer today, you do a chip, you do anything today, it's obsolete in about 19 minutes, right? We've just developed a new computer. It's the greatest thing ever. Three weeks later, somebody does a better one, right? It's a horrible business. And that's why I like real estate. You buy a good piece of land. That's good. I like it better. Simpler, right? But you know what? Everything's obsolete like in 15 minutes, except for two things that you know what that is. I've been telling you, right? A wheel and a wall. In 1,000 years, you'll come back, and the only two things that you'll have that are very modern will be a wheel and a wall. Look at the wall they built over there. They took trucks and they put them together because they don't want any criminals coming in here. So that's a wall. If they had a drone circling up there our great Secret Service — I think our Secret Service would be who are the bad guys and who are the good guys? Look at that. They built a wall. That wall took them about 12 minutes. But the two things are a wheel and a wall they'll all — everything else is going to be obsolete in about 12 minutes. In the last three years, we've arrested over half a million criminal aliens, including those charged with murder, assault, sex offenses. We have over 6,000 murderers that ICE has apprehended in our great Border Patrol, and we owe them a debt of gratitude. Think of that. Think of that. 6,000 murderers we took off the streets, in some cases they're so bad we didn't even want to give them — we have to take — I don't want to pay for them for the next long period of time. Frankly if it was up to me, I'm a person that believes in the death penalty. But what are you going to do? So controversial? So we'll end up keeping them for 50 years. We'll end up feeding them for 50 years. But look, let me just tell you we have. We have what the job that ICE does and Border Patrol and, you know, like this guy's a tough guy. You don't want the job, you don't want it, you don't want it. There's a couple of guys could probably, maybe, you'd be good at it. I don't know, looks pretty tough. You got to be tough. You know, these guys, the ICE guys. You'll see these – these killers from the MS-13 they're total killers. Sit down, folks. They're just — relax there. They're so exciting they won't sit down. Just sit down. But, you know, you get these kids — what? They'll be standing up in about two seconds. Well, that's a compliment, right? It should be a compliment. Right? That's very nice. I appreciate it, but relax. Relax. What the hell else do we have to do tonight? The fact is, does anybody have a better time than at a Trump rally, right? But we don't call it a rally. We call it a friendly protest because legally, if I call it a friendly protest, you're allowed to be here. If you call it a rally, you're entitled to two people or something. Somebody said, "Let's call it a protest." So everybody raise your hand. This is a protest, right? That's actually true. Under the Biden administration, these criminals would be set free. Under the Trump administration these criminals are put in jail or they're sent home. We have to, we can't do this. And by the way the MS-13 gang members are the worst anywhere in the world. They don't even want, right? They don't even — I hope you didn't come into contact with one. No, you know too much about them. I don't know. I'm worried about you. Stand up. I'm worried about you. What the hell do you know so much about MS-13? Look at that guy. You're not — is he with you? You know, what? Can I be honest with you? He's with you. You have no problem. You got no problem. Thank you. Thank you both very much. That's great. Great. But the MS-13, they're killers, they're horrible people. And these people go in and they just — they go in they call them a nest where they're staying. They'll just run in and start swinging and fighting. And they always come out on top and you know what? There aren't a lot of people that would be good at that job. And we have to respect those people that protect us like this. Immigration security is national security. Remember that. And we have to have borders. A nation without borders is not a nation. We don't have a nation. So on behalf of the United States, I'd like to extend my sincere, really sincere condolences to a friend of mine, President Macron of France, where they had just yesterday a vicious, vicious Islamic terrorist attack beheading an innocent teacher near Paris, beheading her a horrible thing. And they've apprehended nine people, who knows? But we've been very, very strong on radical Islamic terrorism, and we do have a ban. People said oh, that's such a terrible thing. Remember I put the ban on and then we got sued and we lost, and then we won in the United States Supreme Court. We've also invested —and France is having a hard time and Macron's a great guy, and I just want to say whatever we can do — we've also invested $2.5 trillion with a "T" trillion dollars in the U.S. military, which was totally depleted when we took over. Including major contracts to build new warships that saved the historic shipyard right here in Marinette Marine and Wisconsin. We gave you billions of dollars. A lot of states wanted that contract. I gave it to you and I came to Marinette about three months ago and they do a great job. But a lot of people wanted that. A lot of states wanted it, and it's okay. I'm going to lose those states, but that's all right. Just remember that Wisconsin, but we gave it. It's going to – it's a lot of jobs. It's actually a very big contract that gets bigger, but they do fantastic work. I looked at what they were doing incredible, talented people, and you would have lost that shipyard. That's a big yard. You would have lost it, but we saved it. Then we've done plenty. We launched the first new branch of the U.S. Armed forces in nearly 75 years. The Space Force and I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous $150 billion for nothing plus 1.8 billion in cash, Iran Nuclear Deal. And if and when we win, if we win, the first call I'm going to get is from the head of Iran and he's going to say let's make a deal. You know, Ron, their economy, their GDP went down 27 percent. They're dying to make a deal. I said, look, you want to really see the election because you're not going to be in a position. You got to see the election. The first call I get will be them. And then I'll tell you the other calls. But I better not, because I'm going to just make the deal harder if I do. But plenty of other nations are going to be calling because they're going to want to make deals. I recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and I also recognized--by the way, every president for many, many presidents, right, every single president said they were going to do that and you went back how many presidents many, many, many decades. And they all said they were going to do it, and they never did it. Because I'll tell you what too, wasn't easy. Once I got the office, the pressure put on your president not to do it was incredible. And I told the story I didn't take phone calls. I got calls from kings and presidents and prime ministers not to do it. Don't do it, sir. Don't do it. We don't want you to do it, you know? And it's going to be horrible if you do it, sir. It'll cause problems. Then finally, I said, "I'll tell you what, who's calling?” “A king?” “Who's calling?” “An emir.” “Who else is calling?” “Prime ministers, presidents, in one case, a queen.” I was thinking about taking her call, but (INAUDIBLE). And I said, "No, no, no. What are they calling about?" "They want to talk you out of moving the capital of Israel to Jerusalem." I said, "Really? It's very important. Okay, tell them that I'm going to call them back on Thursday." I had the press conference on Tuesday, so I said, "Tell him I'll call him back on Thursday. I look forward to talking to him." I then announced that we were doing it and we had Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. And then I call back the heads of all these countries. "Yes, King." "What can I do for you, president of the United States?" "Well, I wanted to talk to you about Israel, but it's already been announced." "Oh, gee. I wish I got to you a little bit soon. I'm sorry." No, it's much, much easier than you know. Like, what do we need? So I got back to him. They were all very disappointed. And you know what? We opened and it was going to cost anywhere from a billion to $2 billion. And I said to my very talented, who is one of the greatest lawyers in New York, David Friedman, a great lawyer. I said David, see if you can get a piece of land cheap or a piece that we already own because they want to spend $2 billion to build this thing. I said, "We can do it cheaper." Calls me back two days later, "Sir, we have a piece of land with a building on it. I think we could renovate it for $350,000 and it'll be nicer than the one they want to build." So we did it for 350. I — actually, first time in my life — I said, "David, I've never said this before, it sounds too cheap. Make it 500,000." So instead of spending a billion to two billion — probably would have never got built. You can imagine the cost overruns, everything else. And this was a better location. A bigger piece of land, better view, better everything, safer. Better part you know we got there early. We have the best land, right? That's why I said it. I said, "David, no matter where you are, we were always there first, right?" If you want a good building, buy a post office, you know it's always there. They were always there first, but we were there first. I said we must and he said we have a great piece of land, the building we fixed it. It was an empty building and it's beautiful and we use Jerusalem stone, which is a complicated thing — but I won't tell you about — very expensive, except if you happen to be in Jerusalem — and it's a beautiful embassy and it's opened. And now we have the capital and I'll tell you something. Think of it. Every single president you go back during their campaign, they used to campaign on it and nobody had the guts to do it. But we did it. Oh, look at you. We did it. Right? Did I do it? And we opened the embassy three months later. Can you believe that instead of 10 years later. We would — we wouldn't have that thing open for 20 years? I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years they worked on it. I got it done in about two hours. And instead of endless war in the Middle East, we're forging peace without blood all over the sand. Okay? And countries are coming in and they all want to come in. And the fact is, I did more in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years. And it's true.What he did was destructive. Now the Democrats are pushing the most far-left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. The Biden plan would destroy your Social Security and destroy protections for people with pre-existing conditions. You don't know that. They want to spend all their money on this ridiculous Green New Deal for $100 trillion. It's crazy. Just AOC plus three. A poor student, she has no idea about the environment. All of a sudden, she is coming up with a Green New Deal, and we will not let them take your cattle. Don't worry about — your cattle are next. The cattle are next. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions, and he wanted to search, and they've agreed to this – this is the manifesto, I call it, with Bernie Sanders, Crazy Bernie — and surge refugee admissions by over 700 percent — this is agreed to — opening the floodgates to radical Islamic terrorism. How's France doing? Not too good. Your state and your country will be overrun and overwhelmed. And it will never happen on my watch. Yeah, for your party. Never. Never, never, Never, Never. Biden wants to ban school choice. The most important thing, school choice. And he wants to end charter schools which have been so successful because he is controlled by a group — but with that, some of the most important people on this planet are teachers. Remember that, we love our teachers. We love our teacher. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. And you know, when you talk about the Black community, the Hispanic community, that's one of the great civil right developments in our countries, it's called school choice. Right? One of the most important things we can do. School choice and charter schools. But school choice. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities. Great job. Just incredible jobs and a limitless future for all Americans. It's really about the American Dream. The American Dream is alive and well.The American Dream is alive and well. Thank you. Please. Thank you very much. And I will say again, again and again had we not been hit with this virus, you would have seen things that, like you've never seen before. But we're going to have it back there very, very soon. We're setting records. We're going to have it back very soon. So in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We've already started. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. Second Amendment. We will strike down terrorists to threaten our children and our citizens. And we will keep America out of these endless and ridiculous foreign wars. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might. We have the greatest military now in the world. When I took over 3.5 years ago, you know it, in the military, our planes were old. Everything was old. Our missiles, our rockets. Our nuclear wasn't in the condition that had to be in. You never want to use it. You never want to use it. We hope to God we never have to use it. Now we have the greatest weapons ever produced by a single country, not even close, the hydro sonic missiles. I call them the Super Duper Missiles. They go seven times faster than a normal missile. Now, President Obama let that get away. They took our plans to Russia and other places. But now we've done, because we had the technology like nobody else, so that missiles, rockets, ships, tanks from Ohio, we make them in Ohio. We kept the plant open. I kept that plant open. Lima. I kept —I kept the plant open. I said, you can't close this plant. The plan was to close it. I said, we make — it's the only place in the country. I visited, went to Ohio with Jim Jordan, a great guy. I visited and I saw the people. I saw the technology and the complexity. I said, "You'll never be able to build — you'll never be able to reproduce it." Anyway we kept it open, and now it's working 24 hours around the clock. Okay? All made in the U.S. New jets, the fighters, F-35s, everything new. And when I took over our military and you know it, the military people, it was totally depleted. We now have the greatest — we're the envy of Russia and China and North Korea and every country in the world. There is nobody that has anything near our weaponry and again we hope to God we never, ever have to use it. But we will have peace through strength. That's what it's all about. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency which goes into effect on January 1st and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs. You know, I — you know, I invoked a thing. You know that, what I did, you know, I invoked the favored nations clause, so we're going to pay whatever the lowest price in the world. I said, "That's what we're going to pay." The difference is 60, 70, 80, 90 percent reduction. I am not very popular however, with Big Pharma. They're spending a lot of money on ads against me. When you see those ads, please remember your drug prices are coming down for a reason. Most powerful lobbyists in the world, they have the biggest lobby in the world by far. But it's the only way. I mean, every year that — what they were doing to people, no good. So and — or maybe we'll make a deal with Big Pharma along the way. But they are spending a fortune of ads, and that's okay. I mean, people get it. It's going to be the biggest price reduction. You're going to go down 60, 70, 80 maybe 90 percent in some cases. We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. And they won't. America will land the first woman in the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We're getting very close. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. You, you. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, "In God we trust." For years you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Wisconsin. Get out and vote. So get your friends and get your family. Get your neighbors. Get your co-workers if you have a big, lazy boss if you have a guy that's 150 pounds overweight, but he's a pretty good boss, but he's a little lazy say, "Boss, I'm sorry, but you have to get up and you have to vote for Trump." You've got to get out and vote and you can request an absentee ballot today. And if you already have one, return that ballot right away or just get out and vote. That's what I like. From Madison to Milwaukee from Osh Kosh to O'Claire — what beautiful names. I love Osh Kosh. I love her. You know why? Children's clothing. I love it. I get plenty of it, right? I know they're laughing. They know I'm right. Buying plenty of it. And from Green Bay to right here in Janesville, we inherit the legacy of Wisconsin patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears for our beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads. I mean, think of these things. Think of these things, what we're talking about. Raised up the great giant skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism, and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world and we are making it greater than ever before. That's what's happening. Proud citizens like you helped build the country. Now you helped build this incredible country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting on and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God and together with the incredible people of Wisconsin, we have made America powerful again. We have made this country powerful, like it's never been. We have made America wealthy again. Our stock market is just about at an all-time high. Look at your stocks. Look at those 401(K)s. How would you feel if it went down by 100 percent? Can only go up. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you. Two minutes and 28 seconds into a campaign rally on a recent Saturday night in Janesville, Wis., President Trump delivered his first lie. “When you look at our numbers compared to what’s going on in Europe and other places,” Mr. Trump said about the coronavirus raging across the United States, “we’re doing well.” The truth? America has more cases and deaths per capita than any major country in Europe but Spain and Belgium. The United States has just 4 percent of the world’s population but accounts for almost a quarter of the global deaths from Covid-19. On Oct. 17, the day of Mr. Trump’s rally in Janesville, cases were rising to record levels across much of the country. Over the course of the next 87 minutes, the president made another 130 false or inaccurate statements. Many were entirely made up. Others were casual misstatements of simple facts, some clearly intended to mislead. He lied about his own record and that of his opponent. He made wild exaggerations that violate even the pliable limits of standard political hyperbole. As Mr. Trump battles for a second term with polls that show him trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, rallies like the one in Wisconsin have become the backbone of his re-election campaign and a font of virtually nonstop misinformation. The president has boasted to reporters that he may hold as many as five rallies each day as he races toward the finish line on Nov. 3. And while presidential candidates use political speech that occasionally bends the truth, Mr. Trump is fundamentally different. His falsehoods are the foundation of his campaign rallies and the connective tissue of the often 90-minute narrative he spins at every stop. A detailed examination of his statements in Janesville by The New York Times found that more than three-quarters of the president’s assertions were either false, misleading, exaggerated, disputed or lacked evidence. Less than a quarter were true. The rally in Wisconsin was hardly unique. Since Inauguration Day almost four years ago, the president has held more than 125 rallies around the country, returning to the place where he feels most comfortable — surrounded by supporters — and where his disconnection from the truth is rewarded with enthusiastic applause. After recovering from a three-day hospitalization for Covid-19, Mr. Trump has delivered similar versions of his stump speech at airport hangars in Florida, Pennsylvania, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada. In each place, he repeats many of the same lies, often verbatim, despite being called out by fact checkers. In one three-minute stretch in Janesville, the president made eight inaccurate statements that had been fact-checked repeatedly before. He claimed to have enacted the “biggest tax cut in history” (it wasn’t); that Mr. Biden was “going to raise your taxes substantially, like quadruple” (the Democratic candidate has promised no tax increase for people making less than $400,000); that “everybody owns stocks” (half of the country does not); that “we cut more regulations than any administration in history” (there is no evidence for this); that Mr. Biden would “ban fracking” (he has said he would not); that Democrats would reduce the child tax credit (Mr. Biden has promised to expand it); that it “used to take 18 to 21 years to get a highway built” but that he had reduced the time to two years (the average has been three to six years, and remains three years); and warned that Mr. Biden would impose a “draconian, unscientific lockdown” (Mr. Biden has said that if scientists believed it was necessary, “I would shut it down, I would listen to the scientists”). Mr. Trump also claimed several times to have “rebuilt” a “depleted” military — a vast overstatement he has made since spring 2017. He told the crowd that his policies had “brought back many car plants” and that previous administrations “hadn’t brought back a plant, I think, it’s 42 years” — a falsehood repeated in State of the Union addresses and in an earlier speech that same day in Michigan. He promised to “protect patients with pre-existing conditions” — a vow he has made since his first year in office that remains at odds with his administration’s legislative and legal record. He said Mr. Biden and Democrats “don’t want to have a border” — an inaccurate charge he leveled against Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Democrats in 2018. The statement is even more inaccurate against Mr. Biden, whose immigration plan includes proposals to improve border screening and includes the line: “Like every nation, the U.S. has a right and a duty to secure our borders.” Mr. Trump insisted, as he has done more than 200 times, that his border wall was being built — in fact, almost all of the 371 miles of barriers replaces or fortifies existing structures — and that “Mexico is paying” for it through a border fee. No border fee has been imposed, and Mexico is not paying the bill. The president does accurately cite some data in promoting his accomplishments, but it often does not seem to be enough for him. He likes to add in falsehoods to dress up the data and make it sound much better than it is. In Janesville, Mr. Trump said he presided over the “greatest” employment numbers for Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian-Americans, women and people without a high school degree. All of that is true. But the president tacked on a claim that employment numbers during his presidency were greatest for “people with a diploma” and “people that graduated first in their class at M.I.T.” In fact, unemployment rates for high school and college graduates were lower before he took office. Mr. Trump took a similar approach to police unions. “Every single law enforcement group in the country has endorsed us, even New York City’s finest,” he told the Wisconsin crowd, as a handful of supporters standing behind him waved “Cops for Trump” signs. “You know, they endorsed us, first time they’ve ever endorsed a presidential candidate.” New York’s largest police union did endorse Mr. Trump, but others, including a union in Cleveland and some Black law enforcement groups, have declined to do so. The president moved on to claim that Mr. Biden did not have the support of law enforcement — more than 190 law enforcement officials have endorsed him — and that the former vice president refused to even utter the words “law and order” during the first presidential debate. (He did.) Later in the rally, Mr. Trump correctly noted that he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel — a promise made by other presidents but fulfilled by him. But he gave a misleading account about how he reduced the cost of a new American Embassy from over $1 billion to $350,000 for a facility “nicer than the one they want to build.” The State Department has said it cost $200,000 to $400,000 to renovate an existing facility in Jerusalem for its reopening as the new embassy in May 2018. Since then, the State Department has awarded a contract to a Maryland company for more than $25 million for continuing renovations. The State Department has estimated a new embassy would cost $500 million, half of what Mr. Trump claimed. Mr. Trump’s falsehoods can get bigger over time. As he reminisced in Wisconsin about his election night victory in 2016, he asked the crowd, “Remember the tears from the totally nonbiased anchors?” His assertion has its origins in his crowing in the first weeks after he was elected president, when he claimed that Martha Raddatz, the ABC anchor, wept on election night. (Ms. Raddatz’s voice cracked at one point, but she did not cry.) Four years later, Mr. Trump has expanded on the lie to encompass multiple anchors. The president also claimed in the rally to have “saved your suburbs,” “your house” and the “American dream.” This vague statement was most likely about an Obama-era housing rule that the Trump administration ended. The rule, Mr. Trump said in July, was “having a devastating impact on these once thriving Suburban areas.” The regulation refined and made more rigorous an existing process to combat housing discrimination, but it did not impose low-income housing or any zoning changes on the suburbs. After three months, the withdrawal of the rule became equivalent to rescuing the American dream from ruin. Many of Mr. Trump’s falsehoods are in service to caricatures of his opponents, a favorite tactic of his presidency. In Wisconsin, he continued to drive home the lie that Mr. Biden spends most of his time in the basement of his Delaware home, saying at one point that “he’s sitting in his basement right now watching us,” and at another point asking, “Does he ever leave Delaware?” In fact, the week before Mr. Trump’s rally, Mr. Biden had traveled to Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. By the end of the rally, the president offered up an inaccurate jab at his most recent predecessor. “Hydrosonic missiles, I call them the super-duper missiles, they go seven times faster than a normal missile,” he said. “Now, President Obama let that get away.” In fact, efforts to revamp the nation’s nuclear arsenal began under Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump had also confused a hypersonic missile with the name of a toothbrush. Before wrapping up with his trademark promise to “make America great again,” the president boasted that he kept open a plant in Lima, Ohio, that makes M1 Abrams tanks for the Army. In truth, there were no plans to shut down the plant, and Congress has authorized hundreds of millions of dollars to continue making the tanks. “The plan was to close it,” Mr. Trump assured his supporters. “Anyway, we kept it open. And now it’s working 24 hours around the clock.” The audience clapped with approval. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
