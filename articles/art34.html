TRANSCRIPT “The last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan —” “Yes, I have.” “— to replace Obamacare.” “Of course I have.” “Well, I’ll give you —” “We got rid of the individual mandate.” “I’m going to give you an opportunity —” ”Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate.” “I’m not here to call out his lies — everybody knows he’s a liar.” “But you agreed — Joe, you’re the liar.” “I want to make sure —” “You graduated last in your class, not first in your class.” “I — [laughs] — God. I want to make sure —” “Mr. President, could you let him finish, sir?” “The question is, the question is —” “A lot of new Supreme Court justices, radical left —” “Will you shut up, man?” “One of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can, they do, they will, under my proposal.” “That’s not what you’ve said, and it’s not what your party has said.” “That is simply a lie.” “Your party doesn’t say it — your party wants to go socialist medicine.” “My party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party.” “And they’re going to dominate you, Joe, you know that.” “I am the Democratic Party right now. The platform of the Democratic Party —” “Not according to Harris.” “— is what I, in fact, approved of.” “Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes each of those two years?” “I’ve paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. Let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don’t want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is.” “I’m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts.” “Good.” “And we’re going to, I’m going to eliminate those tax cuts —” “OK.” “— and make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help. People out there need help.” “But why didn’t you do it over 20, the last 25 years?” “Because you weren’t — because you weren’t president screwing things up.” “You were a senator —” “You’re the worst president America has ever had. Come on.” “You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out antifa and other left-wing —” “That’s right.” “— extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia groups —” “Sure.” “— and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland.” “Sure, I’m willing to do that, but —” “Then do it.” “Go ahead, sir.” “I would say, I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing.” “So what are you, what are you saying —” “I’m willing to do anything — I want to see peace.” “Well, then do it, sir.” “Say it. Do it. Say it.” “You want to call them — what do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name.” “White supremacists and —” “Go ahead, who would you like me to condemn?” “Proud Boys.” “Who?” “White supremacists and right-wing militia.” Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what, I’ll tell you what. Somebody’s got to do something about antifa and the left, because this is not a right-wing problem, this is a left-wing —” “His own F.B.I. director said the threat is —” Are you questioning —” “No, I think masks are OK. You have to understand, if you look, I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on, you know, when I think I need it. Tonight as an example, everybody’s had a test, and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to — but I wear masks when needed. When needed, I wear masks.” “OK, let me ask —” “I don’t wear masks like him — every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from — he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen.” “Masks make a big difference. His own head of the C.D.C. said if we just wore masks between now — if everybody wore masks in social distance between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters.” “And they’ve also said the opposite. They’ve also said —” “No serious person said the opposite.” “The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of Covid that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots, like he does by the way. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting, because he’s trying to scare people into thinking that it’s not going to be legitimate.” “As far as the ballots are concerned, it’s a disaster. A solicited ballot, OK? Solicited is OK. You’re soliciting, you’re asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. This is going to be a fraud like you’ve never seen. The other thing: It’s nice, on Nov. 3, you’re watching and you see who won the election. And I think we’re going to do well, because people are really happy with the job we’ve done. But you know what? We won’t know, we might not know for months — because these ballots are going to be all over.” “Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any dispute?” “Yeah, I think I’m counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely. I don’t think we’ll — I hope we don’t need them in terms of the election itself, but for the ballots, I think so. I am urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully because that’s what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. I am urging my people — I hope it’s going to be a fair election. If it’s a fair election —” “You’re urging them what?” “— I am 100 percent on board. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can’t go along with that.” “Here’s the deal: They count the ballots. As you’ve pointed out, some of these ballots in some states can’t even be opened until Election Day. And if there’s thousands of ballots, it’s going to take time to do it. No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that somehow it’s a fraudulent process.” “It’s already been established.” “He has no idea what he’s talking about. Here’s the deal. The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too. You know why? Because once the winner is declared, after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that will be the end of it.” By Adam Nagourney President Trump’s first debate appearance with Joseph R. Biden Jr., his Democratic rival, was marked by 90 minutes of interruptions, accusations and, at times, flat-out false statements. Here are some of the more memorable moments. TRANSCRIPT “President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer, and in fact, recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning —” “No, I think masks are OK. You have to understand, if you look, I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on, you know, when I think I need it. Tonight as an example, everybody’s had a test, and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to — but I wear masks when needed. When needed, I wear masks.” “OK, let me ask —” “I don’t wear masks like him — every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from — he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen.” “Masks make a big difference. His own head of the C.D.C. said if we just wore masks between now — if everybody wore masks in social distance between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters.” “And they’ve also said the opposite.” “And no serious person said the opposite. No serious person.” “Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci said they didn’t.” “He did not say the opposite.” “He said very strongly, masks are not good. Then he changed his mind, he said masks are good. I’m OK with masks.” Mr. Trump has always been ambivalent about masks as a tool for curbing the spread of the coronavirus; he has reluctantly come to accept them only recently. But even as the president said at the debate on Tuesday night that he wore masks at times, reaching into his pocket to suggest that there was one there, he continued to challenge their effectiveness. “They’ve also said the opposite,” he retorted when Mr. Biden talked about experts’ advocating the use of masks. And he mocked Mr. Biden for wearing one. It was a curious stance for two reasons: One, the consensus of health officials is that masks are critical in curbing the pandemic. Members of the president’s own family were wearing them when they walked into the Cleveland debate hall. It’s also a questionable political calculation. There was a time when Republican strategists thought they could portray Mr. Biden as weak for wearing a mask. But Mr. Biden has regularly worn one in public, with no signs of political damage. No surprise: Polls show that a solid majority of Americans — including a sizable number of Republicans — support mandatory mask wearing. TRANSCRIPT “You’ve got to open these states up. It’s not fair. You’re talking about almost, it’s like being in prison. And you look at what’s going on with divorce, look at what’s going on with alcoholism and drugs — it’s a very, very sad thing. And he’ll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country, and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don’t need somebody to come in and say, ‘Let’s shut it down.’” Mr. Trump, seizing on an answer Mr. Biden gave in a television interview earlier this year, said his Democratic opponent would close down the country in response to the coronavirus pandemic. (Mr. Biden actually said he would defer to scientists on whether to close down parts of the economy.) This goes to a central point of difference between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, and a question that has divided Republicans from Democrats: What is more important, curbing the epidemic or rescuing the economy? Mr. Trump has long believed that his road to re-election is the economy. He has sought to portray Mr. Biden as a proponent of strict policies that would keep people locked down at home and unable to go to work. And the economy is the one issue where Americans in poll after poll say they prefer Mr. Trump. TRANSCRIPT We just got the support of 200, 250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every — excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, I support President Trump. I don’t think you have any law enforcement. You can’t even say the word law enforcement, because if you say those words, you’re going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren’t you saying those words, Joe? Why don’t you say the words law enforcement? We believe in law and order, but you don’t. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, in many cases radical left, and they’ve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don’t want to say anything about law and order. And I’ll tell you what: The people of this country want and demand law and order, and you’re afraid to even say it. Mr. Trump repeatedly mocked Mr. Biden for, as he put it, failing to say the words “law enforcement” or “law and order.” One of Mr. Trump’s dominant attacks on Mr. Biden is to portray him as a captive of the left wing of his party, and in particular, a champion of policies that would undercut law enforcement. Mr. Trump has attacked Mr. Biden in ads that depict the demonstrations that have spread across the nation this summer, and he has warned that a Biden presidency would lead to a spike in crime and disorder. Mr. Trump was trying to drive a wedge between Mr. Biden and those on the left wing of the party, who, the president said, “have you wrapped around their finger.” Polls suggest he has not been successful with this line of attack, and Mr. Biden used this moment to specifically say that he does not support defunding the police. TRANSCRIPT “You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out antifa and other left-wing —” “That’s right.” “— extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia groups —” “Sure.” “— and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland.” “Sure, I’m willing to do that, but —” “Then do it.” “Go ahead, sir.” “I would say, I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing.” “So what are you, what are you saying —” “I’m willing to do anything — I want to see peace.” “Then do it, sir.” “Say it. Do it. Say it.” “You want to call them — what do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name.” “White supremacists and —” “Go ahead, who would you ike me to condemn?” “Proud Boys.” “Who? “White supremacists and right-wing militia.” “Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what, I’ll tell you what. Somebody’s got to do something about antifa and the left, because this is not a right-wing problem, this is a left-wing —” “His own F.B.I. director said the threat comes from white supremacists. Antifa’s an idea, not an organization —” “Oh, you’ve got to be kidding.” “— not a militia. That’s what his F.B.I, his F.B.I. director has said.” “Well then, you know what? He’s wrong.” This was one of those moments in which it appeared that Mr. Trump was debating Chris Wallace, the determined (if at times presidentially besieged) moderator. Mr. Wallace, the host of “Fox News Sunday,” noted that Mr. Trump had called on Mr. Biden to condemn antifa, the loosely organized left-wing political movement. Mr. Wallace asked if Mr. Trump would condemn white supremacist groups that have been involved in often violent demonstrations around the country. First Mr. Trump suggested he would condemn them, saying: “I’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace.” “Say it,” Mr. Wallace implored. But Mr. Trump never did so, rejecting a suggestion by Mr. Biden that he denounce in particular the Proud Boys, a far-right, white extremist group. Instead, he told the group to “stand back and stand by.” Mr. Trump has recoiled at criticizing even his most extreme supporters, including white supremacists. But it is notable that he did not seize this opportunity to modulate his position in front of such a large audience and with a clear political need to expand his appeal beyond his base. The first presidential debate devolved into chaos and name-calling, and President Trump notably refused to condemn white supremacists. Read the latest updates.
