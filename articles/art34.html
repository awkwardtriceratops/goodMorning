TRANSCRIPT “The wind yesterday was outrageous. It was coming out of the north, and it didn’t stop. It just got more intense as time went on. And we hunkered down and did the best we could. We don’t have any damage to our building, but I hope others fared as well. And it was it was horrific. It was horrific.” “It was quite a night, lost power about 7. This street here was like a river. A lot of rain, a lot of debris that was floating around from remnants of Laura. But all in all, we got punched in the face but we’re getting back up.” By Rick Rojas and Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio BELL CITY, La. — Hurricane Delta tore across Louisiana late Friday, leaving a trail of destruction as it turned roadways into rapids and uprooted trees that crashed onto roofs. It also dealt a demoralizing blow to a state still staggering its way back from one of the most powerful storms that it had ever endured. Delta made landfall in Cameron Parish, less than 20 miles to the east from where Hurricane Laura, with its 150 mile-per-hour winds, devastated communities in late August. And it cut a similar path across a wide swath of the state, hurling debris still piled up from the last storm and toppling utility poles and power lines that crews had just put back up. “The town’s a mess,” Roberta Palermo said of Lake Arthur, La., a small community in Jefferson Davis Parish, which borders Cameron Parish, where she rode out Delta in the hotel she owns. “There’s debris everywhere and trash that didn’t get picked up from the first storm.” Cameron Parish, a sprawling and sparsely populated area in the southwest corner of the state, was swamped yet again by storm surge. And in nearby Lake Charles, fierce winds had pulverized much of the area during Hurricane Laura, but Delta had unleashed flooding. It quickly became evident that Delta, which hit the coast as a Category 2 storm, lacked the physical force of Laura, a Category 4 hurricane. Still, Delta seemed almost like a testament to nature’s capacity for cruelty, swooping in at the tail end of a brutal, record-breaking hurricane season and pounding beleaguered communities where the lives of residents had already been upended. “People are feeling a little despondent,” Nic Hunter, the mayor of Lake Charles, said in an interview on Saturday morning. “To go through what we went through six weeks ago, and have another punch in the gut like we received last night, is just unimaginable.” Delta, the 10th named storm to make landfall in the United States this year, arrived in the final weeks of an Atlantic hurricane season so busy that forecasters ran through an alphabet of names and moved on to calling storms by Greek letters. It had been 15 years since a season, which runs from June to November, has been this active. The storm made landfall on Friday at about 6 p.m. local time in Cameron Parish, and pushed through the state overnight into Saturday, weakening into a tropical depression. Still, meteorologists warned of the continued threat of flash floods and tornadoes as the storm brought heavy rain and lashing winds across a span reaching from the East Texas coast to as far east as Baton Rouge. “We’re going to work as hard as we can, as fast as we can to get everybody’s lives right side up again,” Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said at a briefing on Saturday. “As if Hurricane Laura wasn’t enough, we had to have Delta come through last night.” The storm swept through Creole, an unincorporated area of Cameron Parish that had been virtually wiped out by Laura. The intersection that had constituted downtown, with a gas station, restaurant and grocery store, had been reduced to scattered rubble. The parish, the largest in Louisiana in terms of land mass yet also one of the least populated, had seen an exodus after previous epic hurricanes, Rita in 2005 and Ike in 2008. Now the residents who remained, weary after Laura and dreading the storms likely to come in the future, are contemplating leaving. “People aren’t hanging around anymore,” said Richard Zuschlag, the chief executive and chairman of Acadian Ambulance, which is based in Lafayette and serves much of the Gulf Coast region. In Lake Charles, aerial photographs before Delta barreled through captured blotches of blue — the tarpaulins covering homes and businesses whose roofs had been shaved off by Hurricane Laura’s winds. Many of those were ripped off, exposing homes to the elements once again. The response to Delta was further complicated as Laura had uprooted thousands of families, many of whom were still living this week in hotels that had been transformed into makeshift shelters. As of Saturday morning, there were 9,441 Louisiana residents in shelters, of which 935 were Delta evacuees. More people could need shelters over the next few nights, Mr. Edwards said. Favorable dry weather over the next few days will allow the state to get “a pretty good start” on the recovery, he said. The widespread power outages after Delta have also rekindled fears of one of the worst perils after Hurricane Laura, as many of the deaths associated with that storm were from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by the fumes from generators. Delta’s path deviated enough from Laura’s to mount a direct assault on parts of the central Louisiana coast that had only been scraped by the earlier storm. In some parts of the state, meteorologists said the storm dumped as much as 15 inches of rain. Nearly 600,000 customers in Louisiana were without power on Saturday morning, with thousands more reported in Texas and Mississippi. A television station in Lafayette asked its viewers to send in their accounts of Delta’s toll. Many said they could hear transformers popping through the night and others sent in videos of carports wavering in the wind. Sheds had been picked up and tossed, they said, and bricks had been shorn from a building in downtown Lafayette. “I’m afraid for daylight to see the damage out there,” one woman who rode out the storm in her home in Rayne, a small town west of Lafayette, wrote in a post on Saturday on the Facebook page of KATC-TV. “We have a tree blocking our back door and we don’t even have trees on our property.” On Saturday, lots of homes around Lafayette saw near misses of fallen tree limbs, severed branches and uprooted water oaks. A chorus of sirens and chain saws whirred throughout the day. John Dean, 31, saw a bulky branch rip off the trunk of a pine tree 10 feet from his house and crack onto the corner of an awning, unseating nails and wood paneling. The wind ripped through his block of St. Charles Street, on Lafayette’s north side, but scattered only a few branches in his neighbor’s yard. Neither Mr. Dean, who lives with his 9-year-old son, nor his neighbor, Ricky Blackwell, 65, thought about leaving ahead of the storm. “It costs too much. If I would have gone out of town, I’d come back to this tree and have no money to pay for a chain saw,” Mr. Dean said. He kicked a post holding the awning back into place and went back to raking leaves. Elsewhere, there were signs that Delta had not been as destructive as Laura: The Chinese takeout in Jennings had a line of cars in the drive-through, and a Postal Service truck delivered mail along a country route. Gaynell Bourque considered herself blessed: She had a roof over her head. “It happens to be blue and a tarp and not permanent,” she said as she sat on her front porch with her son, Jacob Milligan, in Bell City, a tiny unincorporated town outside of Lake Charles. But, she believed, “We’re doing a lot better than some of the other people.” She had been tempted by anger after experiencing Laura’s devastation and three weeks without electricity, before yet another storm blew in. She held onto her sense of optimism, but still, she was frustrated. “I’m done,” she said. “I’m never going to stay for a hurricane again.” Michael Cormier, her partner, walked up. It had taken a lot of work to clean up after Laura, and now he faced a good deal more. “After every storm, you have to start at the bottom and work your way back to the top,” he said. “One day at a time, that’s all you can do.” In Lake Arthur, a waterfront town of some 2,000 people between Lake Charles and Lafayette, Ms. Palermo, 64, was trying to pick up trash that the gusts had scattered. Shingles were missing from both her hotel and her home, and the electricity was out. “I’m tired, but I’ll make it,” said Ms. Palermo, who is also a registered nurse who works night shifts. “It has not been a fun year.” Rick Rojas reported from Bell City, La., and Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio from New York.
