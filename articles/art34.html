Trump compares officers who shoot people to golfers who ‘choke’ and floats baseless ‘dark shadows’ theory about Biden. Biden will visit Kenosha ‘soon,’ the D.N.C. chairman says. Trump’s claim that ‘thugs’ in ‘black uniforms’ were planning attack echoes far-right social media posts. Biden is expected to shatter records with more than $300 million raised in August. Democratic primaries in Massachusetts pit progressives against congressional veterans. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in a departure, endorses 23 first-term House Democrats. As Republicans and Democrats wage war over voting rules, three states take bold steps. President Trump traveled to Wisconsin Tuesday on a trip with the potential to roil the delicate local conditions on the ground in Kenosha and to rattle his own re-election campaign, a day after he declined to denounce a 17-year-old white gunman who is charged with killing two people during a night of unrest in the city last week. Kenosha braced for his visit, with helicopters buzzing overhead and a heavy presence of armored vehicles in the city throughout the morning. Streets were closed and commuter trains to Chicago were halted. The family of Jacob Blake, who was shot by a police officer more than a week ago, organized a community gathering in the place he was shot. A crowd of Black Lives Matter activists mixed with Trump supporters gathered in downtown Kenosha to await the president’s arrival, occasionally chanting in each other’s faces and hurling insults. “This is just ridiculous,” said John Crisman, who drove in from nearby Paddock Lake, Wis. “I was just standing here with my sign and some old lady started telling me that Black lives don’t matter, all lives matter. It’s just disheartening to see all this.” Several dozen of Mr. Trump’s fans, wearing red caps and waving American flags,  cheered as the president drove by, then immediately headed back to their cars. “How often do you get to see a president?” asked Dan Dowd of Long Grove, Ill., as he and his wife, Diane, left the gathering. Mr. Trump’s comments about the teenage gunman, made in the White House briefing room on Monday, came amid a series of developments that undercut his law-and-order campaign message and left his aides straining to defend the president’s public behavior. His apparent sympathy for a teenager charged with murder, who spoke openly about seeing himself as a kind of vigilante, may upend a national debate over criminal justice and safety that Republicans hope will work to their advantage in the presidential race. The president’s remarks came hours after his Democratic challenger, Joseph R. Biden Jr., had challenged Mr. Trump to condemn acts of violence coming from the political right. Mr. Trump did not do so. In addition to making forgiving comments about the teenager, Kyle Rittenhouse,  who attended a Trump rally earlier this year, Mr. Trump defended supporters of his who fired paintball pellets and pepper spray into a crowd in Portland, Ore. On Monday, Mr. Biden denounced social disorder in his strongest language yet — “It’s lawlessness, plain and simple, and those who do it should be prosecuted,” he said — and accused Mr. Trump of fomenting violence for political purposes. “Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is re-elected?” Mr. Biden asked, trying to turn Mr. Trump’s public safety-themed arguments against him. Any traditional president would be expected to play a calming and consoling role while visiting an American city that is still reeling from a police shooting and ensuing civil disorder. There is little expectation that Mr. Trump’s presence will act as a balm on the situation. On the contrary, the president has indicated at every turn that he intends to turn the events in Kenosha into a weapon of political division. Even before his comments in the briefing room, Mr. Trump was criticizing local Democratic leaders in Wisconsin and other places where some protests have turned violent, maintaining a drumbeat of ominous and misleading messaging that defined the Republican convention last week. He attacked “radical left mayors and governors” on Twitter, blaming them for unruly demonstrations and incidences of rioting. Representative Mark Pocan, a Democrat and Kenosha native, stood outside a library in downtown Kenosha on Tuesday and said he hoped that when Mr. Trump arrived he would bring with him a message of unity. “It would be great to find his inner spirit, hopefully,” Mr. Pocan said. “Donald Trump takes care of Donald Trump all too often. It would be nice if Donald Trump took care of Kenosha for a change.” Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, a Democrat, had asked Mr. Trump to put off his visit, but the president proceeded anyway. Mr. Evers announced a measure to help the city recover from last week’s unrest: businesses that were damaged by fires or other vandalism will be eligible to apply for $20,000 interest-free loans for rebuilding. The governor called a special session in the state capital of Madison on Monday to address police reform, but Republican legislators, who hold a majority, chose not to participate. No votes or debates took place. Kejuan Goldsmith, an activist, said that a large crowd of demonstrators would gather outside the Kenosha County courthouse beginning at 3:30 p.m., with a presence that he hoped would prevail over Mr. Trump’s message. “We don’t want any of the negativity,” Mr. Goldsmith said. “I know he’s going to try to turn all this positivity into negativity. But we’re out here fighting. We’re doing this because we demand justice.” While it remains to be seen what exactly Mr. Trump might do and say in Kenosha, one omission from his itinerary is clear enough: He is not expected to meet with members of the Blake family.  — Julie Bosman and Alexander Burns President Trump compared instances of the police shooting people to golfers who “choke” when trying to sink “a three-foot putt” when speaking about the shooting of Jacob Blake during an unrestrained interview on Fox News late Monday — a day before heading to Kenosha, Wis., to show his support for law enforcement. The president also floated a vague, baseless conspiracy theory that powerful people in the “dark shadows” were behind Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign as well as protests in Kenosha and other cities, echoing themes struck by his supporters in the QAnon movement.   Mr. Trump’s remarks — which seemed to alarm even his sympathetic interviewer, Laura Ingraham — came as Wisconsin officials implored him to scrap or postpone his visit to Kenosha today, out of concern his presence could provoke violence and stoke unrest. In comparable times of crisis, presidents have attempted to ease tensions, and Mr. Biden has asked protesters on both sides to eschew violence. Mr. Trump, who has expressed his appreciation for conservative counterprotesters —  many of whom have been waving Trump-Pence flags — has not taken that approach. At one point in their interview, when Ms. Ingraham asked Mr. Trump who was behind Mr. Biden’s campaign, he replied, “People that you’ve never heard of, people that are in the dark shadows.” She responded, “That sounds like a conspiracy theory.” “There are people that are on the streets, there are people that are controlling the streets,” Mr. Trump said. “We had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend. And in the plane, it was almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that.” There were “a lot of the people were on the plane to do big damage,” Mr. Trump said. He provided no evidence for his claims. When Ms. Ingraham asked for more detail, he said the matter was still under investigation, adding, “I’ll tell you sometime.” Asked about his comments before boarding Air Force One bound for Kenosha on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump was hardly any clearer about who told him that. “I could tell you that I can probably refer you to the person and they could do it,” he told reporters. “I would like to ask that person if it was OK. The person on the plane said there were about six people like that person or more or less and what happened is the entire plane filled up with the looters, the anarchists, rioters, people looking for trouble. The person felt very uncomfortable on the plane. It is a person you know. I’ll see whether or not I can get that person to speak to you.” When Ms. Ingraham asked Mr. Trump about violence toward the police, the president said that officers in the U.S. were under siege because they occasionally “choke” and make mistakes. “They can do 10,000 great acts, which is what they do, and one bad apple, or a choker, you know, a choker, they choke,” the president said. “Shooting the guy in the back many times,” he continued, referencing what happened to Mr. Blake, “I mean, couldn’t you have done something different, couldn’t you have wrestled him? You know, I mean, in the meantime he might’ve been going for a weapon. You know there’s a whole big thing there, but they choke. Just like in a golf tournament, they miss a three-foot putt.” Ms. Ingraham, who repeatedly interrupted Mr. Trump during their interview to give him a chance to tone down his comments, tried to stop him as he was saying the word “putt.” “You’re not comparing it to golf? Because of course that’s what the media will say,” she said. “I’m saying people choke,” Mr. Trump said. “You’ve got a quarter of a second to make a decision. If you don’t make the decision and you’re wrong, you’re dead.” That Mr. Trump would choose to use a golf metaphor is not surprising. The president, who owns luxury courses around the globe, has played more than 275 rounds since taking office, a far greater rate than his predecessor, President Barack Obama. — Glenn Thrush Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said on Tuesday that Joseph R. Biden Jr. planned to visit Kenosha “as soon as possible” to help calm the roiled Wisconsin city — and slammed President Trump’s trip there as an attempt to fuel “hate.” Mr. Perez, speaking on a conference call with reporters, said Mr. Biden’s team was working on plans for a visit, “but he wants to make sure he gets to talk to everyone,” including the families of two protesters killed in a confrontation last week. Mr. Perez, who headed the Justice Department’s civil rights division under former President Barack Obama, cited Mr. Trump’s defense of the teenager accused of killing the protesters as evidence that “hate has become mainstream with President Trump’s blessing,” Local officials, including Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, had called for Mr. Trump to cancel or delay his visit, as Mr. Biden has done. Earlier in the day, Symone Sanders, a top Biden aide, said in a CNN interview that he would travel to Wisconsin “very soon,” but that he “doesn’t want to do anything that would create a tussle, if you will, on the ground.” Janet Napolitano, a former Homeland Security secretary under Mr. Obama who was on the call, said that Mr. Biden “won’t be there to incite violence, he won’t be there to bigfoot a governor and a mayor” and he is not going there “to save a campaign.” Mr. Perez also called out Mr. Trump’s assertion, during an interview on Fox News Monday, that police officers who shoot people were comparable to golfers who “choke” when trying to sink a “three-foot putt.” “When he isn’t lining up his own putt, he is sowing division,” Mr. Perez said of the president.    — Glenn Thrush and Thomas Kaplan President Trump made a startling claim during his eventful interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News Wednesday night: Leftist “thugs” decked out in black combat gear had plans to incite violence during the Republican National Convention and other events. “We had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend,” Mr. Trump told Ms. Ingraham — who said it sounded like a conspiracy theory to her. “And in the plane, it was almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that.” Mr. Trump gave no evidence for the claim when pressed for more information, saying only “I’ll tell you sometime.” But the charge made by Mr. Trump bears a striking resemblance to a slew of unsubstantiated claims, which went viral on social media earlier this year, that roving, black-clad gangs of Antifa members were planning to violently disrupt events and everyday life in communities around the country. On Tuesday, NBC reported on a June 1 Facebook post, written by a man in Emmett, Idaho, and shared almost 3,000 times, that tracked nearly word for word with the president’s claim: “At least a dozen males got off the plane in Boise from Seattle, dressed head to toe in black,” the post read. “Be ready for attacks downtown and residential areas.” The president also floated the baseless conspiracy theory that powerful people in the “dark shadows” were behind Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign. The White House later released a statement pointing to a new federal investigation of the financing of protesters, an inquiry confirmed on Monday night by Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of homeland security. “The president is referring to questions that need answers such as who may be funding travel and lodging for organized rioters,” Sarah Matthews, a White House spokeswoman, said in the statement. The president’s interview prompted a wave of social media mockery from Mr. Biden’s supporters, some of whom floated their own unsubstantiated theories about Mr. Trump. “Is he A. physically unwell (stroke)? B. nuts (full-scale paranoia)?” asked Robert Reich, the former labor secretary under President Bill Clinton, on Twitter. “Either way, this is a serious problem. He still controls the nuclear codes.” The rumor that Antifa was coming to town gained so much traction in the Boise area in early June, during the apex of national protests prompted by the killing of George Floyd, that the Payette County Sheriff’s department issued a statement labeling a series of Facebook posts promoting the rumor as “false information,” according to the Idaho Statesman. False claims about Antifa spread widely on social media in the wake of Floyd killing. In Klamath Falls, Ore., a group of conservative activists, carrying hammers, guns and baseball bats, showed up to a peaceful protest after being told that Antifa members, bankrolled by billionaire philanthropist George Soros, were being bused in to burn down the town. — Glenn Thrush Joseph R. Biden Jr. is expected to report a record-breaking haul of donations for August, raising more than $300 million between his campaign and his shared committees with the Democratic Party, according to two people familiar with the matter. The sum would shatter past monthly records as small donors have poured money into Mr. Biden’s coffers, especially since the selection of Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, and big contributors have given checks that can be as large as $620,000. In a sign of the financial momentum behind Democrats, ActBlue, the main site that processes donations to the party, reported the second-biggest fund-raising day in its history on Monday, with more than $35 million donated. A majority of Mr. Biden’s August total came from online grass-roots donors, according to a campaign official. The people familiar with Mr. Biden’s fund-raising did not know the exact final figure for the month of August, or how much higher than $300 million it would be. The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Any amount above $300 million would surpass previous monthly hauls by candidates of both parties. It is more, for instance, than what Donald J. Trump ($90 million) and Hillary Clinton ($143 million) raised in August 2016 — combined. In July, President Trump and the Republican National Committee out-raised Mr. Biden and the Democrats, $165 million to $140 million. The Trump campaign has not announced its August fund-raising total but has said it raised $76 million over its four-day convention last week, slightly more than the $70 million the Biden campaign said it collected during its convention a week earlier. — Shane Goldmacher President Trump has seized on the response in the streets to police brutality against Black men and women to bolster his re-election campaign, employing provocative and sometimes incendiary language and images to incite his followers, demonize his opponents or both. He has sought to conflate all protesters with the small minority of people who have looted stores, started fires and engaged in violence against police officers. He has blamed street unrest on Democratic mayors and governors and even Joseph R. Biden Jr. He has also repeatedly threatened to deploy federal forces. And especially since a man affiliated with a right-wing group was shot and killed in Portland, Ore., on Saturday night, he has seemed to encourage freelance action by his own supporters who have showed up as well in places like Kenosha, Wis., eager to counter the protesters and sometimes engaging in violence themselves. Mr. Trump’s approach, intended to divert attention from the human and economic costs of the pandemic, is consistent with a career of combative politics that play to racial animosities, going back to his time in business. Since becoming president, he has seemed to equate white supremacists marching to preserve a Confederate statue in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 with the people who demonstrated against them. And in 2018, during the midterm congressional campaign, he repeatedly warned that caravans of would-be immigrants heading to the southern border posed a national threat, a topic he quickly dropped after the elections. — Peter Baker The incumbent Senator Edward J. Markey and his challenger, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, are headlining the Massachusetts primary vote on Tuesday, but their bitter head-to-head battle is not the only race on the ballot. Voters also will weigh in on a set of House primaries that have pitted some of the party’s more moderate politicians against a lineup of more progressive upstarts. In deep-blue Massachusetts — where both of the state’s senators and all nine of its representatives are Democrats — the results of Tuesday’s votes could be a bellwether for the future of the party, and serve as a test of strength for the Democratic Party’s more progressive wing in Massachusetts and elsewhere. Polls opened at 7 a.m. Eastern time and close at 8 p.m. Seven candidates are running for the seat representing the Fourth District, the one Mr. Kennedy is vacating. The progressives on the ballot — including Jesse Mermell, a front-runner who has been endorsed by Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Ihssane Leckey, who has been endorsed by Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota — might split the vote, which could present an opportunity for Jake Auchincloss, 32, a Marine veteran endorsed by The Boston Globe. In the Eighth Congressional District, which includes part of Boston, Robbie Goldstein, 36, an infectious disease specialist, has mounted a progressive challenge to the longtime incumbent Stephen Lynch, 65. And in the First Congressional District in western Massachusetts, the 16-term congressman Richard E. Neal — who, as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is one of the most powerful Democrats in the House — is facing a challenge from Alex B. Morse, the 31-year-old mayor of Holyoke. Mr. Neal, 71, has been in Congress since 1989, the year Mr. Morse was born. Mr. Morse has been endorsed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York; Mr. Neal has been endorsed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It has been a tumultuous race for Mr. Morse, who considered dropping out several weeks ago after he was accused of inappropriate advances toward students at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where he was once a guest lecturer. He opted to remain in the race after The Intercept published messages from some of the students who had lodged accusations, revealing that they had discussed how they might damage his campaign. But none of these races have drawn as much attention as the Senate contest between Mr. Markey, 74, and Mr. Kennedy, 39, who now is trailing in the polls. The two represent different generations of Democratic and state politics but are running on similar platforms, with each campaigning as the bold, progressive insurgent. — Jacey Fortin The United States Chamber of Commerce, the influential and heavily Republican-leaning pro-business lobby, plans to break with past practice and endorse 23 first-term House Democrats in the coming weeks, according to a person familiar with its plans, giving a boost to vulnerable Democratic incumbents and rankling conservatives. Among the Democrats the chamber intends to support are Representatives Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria of Virginia, Antonio Delgado of New York, Kendra Horn of Oklahoma, Abby Finkenauer of Iowa and Xochitl Torres Small of New Mexico. Each faces a difficult re-election fight this fall in a district that has traditionally voted Republican. The imprimatur of the powerful group would help burnish their claims of bipartisanship in races where Republican opponents say the Democrats are socialists in the thrall of party radicals. The chamber also voted to endorse 29 freshman House Republicans. The endorsements are likely to be rolled out publicly in the coming weeks. A spokesman declined to comment on the internal deliberations, which were first reported by The Hill. As arguably the country’s most powerful business organization, the chamber has disproportionately supported Republican candidates, pumping tens of millions of dollars into their campaigns. While the group has endorsed a smattering of Democrats in recent years, they have represented a tiny fraction of the candidates it has supported. But since President Trump took office — frequently clashing with Republican orthodoxy on trade and other economic issues — the chamber has made a concerted effort to reimagine the way it evaluates candidates to try to spur bipartisanship on Capitol Hill, on the theory that doing so would better serve businesses. Conservatives have balked at the shift, trying to derail the endorsement of the Democrats and criticizing the move once it became public. Brad Todd, a prominent Republican strategist working on congressional campaigns this fall, said in an interview that the chamber was putting at risk the most significant pro-business measure in recent memory: the corporate tax cut passed by Republicans in 2017, which Democrats opposed. “It is the most hard-fought victory for free enterprise in the last 15 years, and the chamber is an active and willing ally in giving it up,” Mr. Todd said. “By endorsing the most vulnerable members of the House Caucus, they are endorsing the continued majority of Nancy Pelosi.” — Nicholas Fandos Republicans and Democrats are waging a legal trench war over the rules for casting a ballot in November that may have decisive consequences in some states. Republicans say they want to tighten voting requirements to prevent fraud, though experts say fraud is a minuscule election problem. Democrats favor rules that make it easier to vote. Monday saw three developments in that legal war, all in states that could be competitive in the presidential election. In Texas, the Republican attorney general filed suit to stop the chief election official in heavily Democratic Harris County — Houston, to most people — from sending applications to vote by mail to two million voters. The filing said the mailing would create confusion and encourage fraud. Texas is mired in a deeply partisan battle over who should be able to cast an absentee ballot in a pandemic, with Republicans largely managing to defend restrictive state rules. Texas is one of just six states that prohibit voters worried about getting Covid-19 from casting ballots by mail instead of in person. But no law bars county officials from sending applications to voters. The attorney general nevertheless argued that the mass mailing exceeds the authority “implied” under state law. In Iowa, national Democrats sued to overturn an order by the Republican secretary of state that bars county clerks from sending voters absentee ballot applications that have been pre-completed with details like voters’ names and addresses. Paul Pate, Iowa’s secretary of state, has said that only blank applications are valid; Republicans argue that making voters fill in those missing details is an important security measure. The issue has consequences: Last week, local judges in two Iowa counties invalidated some 64,000 pre-completed ballot requests that voters had already submitted, effectively making those voters repeat the process. Thousands of additional ballot applications that had been sent out but had not been returned also would be negated. The Democratic lawsuit argues that county officials have sent similarly completed ballot applications in past years without objection. And in Georgia, a federal district judge sided with national Democrats and ordered an extension of the deadline by which absentee ballots must be received to be considered valid. Current rules invalidate any mail ballot received after the 7 p.m. closing of the polls on Election Day. The ruling extends that deadline to 7 p.m. on the third day after Election Day for any ballot that is postmarked no later than Election Day. Citing the burdens of the pandemic — and noting that the state rejected 7,821 ballots as late in the state’s June primary election — the judge said the risk that valid votes would go uncounted was considerable. — Michael Wines The 2020 presidential race will be decided by voters in a dozen competitive states, where Joseph R.

But since President Trump entered office, books about his campaign, his administration, his family, his business, his policies, even his golf game have poured out of publishing houses big and small. And many of these titles have sold extraordinarily well. “No matter what your political position, there’s really no doubt that the strong feelings around the Trump administration have pushed book sales in a way we’ve never seen before in the political arena,” said Kristen McLean, the executive director of business development at NPD Books, a market research firm. “The volume of best-selling titles is really remarkable.” Early on in Mr. Trump’s presidency came the first big journalistic exposés, starting with Michael Wolff’s “Fire and Fury” and then Bob Woodward’s “Fear,” which sold more than two million copies. Next came the insider accounts of the tumult within the White House from the many officials who resigned or were fired and sought to revive their reputations and fortunes with breathless, often news-making memoirs. Those included works by Anthony Scaramucci, who served for 11 days as the White House director of communications; Cliff Sims, another former White House communications aide; Omarosa Manigault Newman, former assistant to the president; James Comey, former F.B.I. director; John Bolton, former national security adviser; and Anonymous, a senior figure in the Trump administration. If there was any concern that readers would grow tired of tell-alls, it has been relieved by sales figures. Trump book sales are still soaring: This summer, Mr. Bolton’s book sold more than a million copies, while Ms. Trump’s book has gone into its 20th printing. “Political books broadly have worked more or less in proportion to how polarizing the figure that they orbit is, and you don’t get more polarizing than Donald J. Trump,” said Eamon Dolan, an executive editor at Simon & Schuster who edited Ms. Trump’s book. “However you feel about the president in political terms or existential terms for what he might do for or to the country, he makes great copy.” — Elizabeth A. Harris and Alexandra Alter President Trump on Tuesday won another delay in the long-running legal battle over whether he must turn over eight years of tax returns to the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which subpoenaed them last year in a criminal investigation focused on Mr. Trump, his business and his associates. In a brief order, a federal appeals court in New York said it would temporarily block a grand jury subpoena issued by the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a Democrat, while it considers Mr. Trump’s arguments that the request was “wildly overbroad” and politically motivated. The ruling is the latest development in the president’s aggressive effort to keep his tax returns and other financial records out of the hands of prosecutors, Congress and others — a dispute that has reached the United States Supreme Court once and is almost certain to return there. With an election looming, the ruling means that, as a practical matter, prosecutors will not receive Mr. Trump’s records for at least another month, and perhaps longer if the president seeks a review in the Supreme Court. — Benjamin Weiser and William K.
