Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Wednesday. Weather: Sunny and warmer. High in the low 60s. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Nov. 11 (Veterans Day). Election Day is over, but the ballot counting isn’t. Joseph R. Biden Jr. easily won New York’s 29 electoral votes on Tuesday night, but final tallies in races across the state, and the country, might not be known for days — or perhaps weeks. You can find the latest results from New York State here. As of 5 this morning, Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican endorsed by President Trump, was comfortably leading Representative Max Rose, the Democratic incumbent in a congressional district that includes Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was declared the winner in her congressional district, in the Bronx and Queens, as expected. Ritchie Torres, a Democratic city councilman representing the Bronx, won his House race, and Mondaire Jones, a Hudson Valley lawyer, was expected to win over the Republican candidate in his district. The men would become the first two openly gay Black members of Congress. Mr. Torres would also be the first openly gay Afro-Latino member of Congress. On Long Island, Representative Lee Zeldin, a conservative incumbent, was ahead of his Democratic rival, Nancy Goroff. And Andrew Garbarino, a Republican state assemblyman, was leading Jackie Gordon, a Democrat, for the former seat of Representative Peter T. King, but only 15 percent of the estimated vote total was in. Upstate, Representative John Katko, a Republican, was holding off his Democratic challenger, Dana Balter, in a Syracuse-based district that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. And Representative Elise Stefanik, whom Mr. Trump has called a “Republican star,” was re-elected to a fourth term. [What’s at stake in the elections in New York.] This year, there was an influx of people who voted by mail, and local boards of elections won’t begin accounting for every ballot cast until at least Friday. That’s when the state Board of Elections anticipates it will complete a review required under law to ensure that no one attempted to vote more than once. When that process is complete, counties can begin opening mail-in ballot envelopes. New York City was planning to start counting these ballots on Monday. The counting process may also face legal disputes from candidates. In June, for instance, it took six weeks to finalize results in some key primaries. [How long will the counting drag on in New York?] Local elections boards also have until next Tuesday to receive domestic absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day, and until Nov. 16 for overseas and military ballots. The boards must report results to the state by Nov. 28. The state then has until Dec. 8 to send certified results to the Electoral College. Reporting was contributed by Luis Ferré-Sadurní, Jesse McKinley, Dana Rubinstein and Daniel E. Slotnik. Recreational Marijuana Legalized by New Jersey Voters 2,258 N.J.

More homeless people than usual have reportedly sought shelter deep in subway tunnels as the weather has grown colder. [Daily News] Here are 12 new art installations to see around the city, including a message of hope at the Prospect Park Bandshell. [Untapped New York] The group Village Preservation created an interactive map that lets users explore the history of the area just south of Union Square. [amNewYork] Laura Collins-Hughes writes: Wrapping around a corner in Times Square, the storefront had been hidden in plain sight since the tail end of winter, when so much of the city’s creative life shut down. The playwright, director and puppet designer Robin Frohardt had been putting the finishing touches on a new show inside. Part art installation, part immersive puppet play, “The Plastic Bag Store” was meant to open in March, its space tricked out to look like an eco-warrior parody of a well-stocked grocery. Audiences would have been welcome to touch the faux merchandise (brightly colored replicas of fruit and vegetables, bakery items and more, all made from plastic waste), and invited to help arrange the seating at performance time. Puppeteers would have crowded close together to enact Ms. Frohardt’s wry dreamscape of a comedy, with shadow puppets to tell the bit that takes place in the ancient past, and bunraku puppets for the parts set in the contemporary world and the far-off future. [Read more about the show.] When the show finally did open, in late October, the installation was still the size of a roomy bodega, complete with deli counter and cigarette rack. But the live puppet play had become a beautifully filmed puppet play, and what would have been audiences of 50 had been whittled to a maximum of 12. Developed over four years and timed to coincide with the city’s new plastic bag ban — its enforcement was postponed in March and only implemented in October — “The Plastic Bag Store” is an emphatic work of activism that is also a wistful work of art. Timed tickets are free. It’s Wednesday — waste not, want not. Dear Diary: I grew up in a tiny town in Michigan, and every summer my mother would take my sisters and me on a trip to Long Island. We always spent one day in New York City, and we loved it. It was so busy. We rode the subway, walked Fifth Avenue, explored Central Park and Greenwich Village and, sometimes, stopped at F.A.O. Schwartz. One day on one of our trips to the city, we were on a busy street that was swarming with people. At one point, a woman walking toward us paused and looked directly at my mother. “My God, lady,” she said, “couldn’t you at least put your hair in a French twist?” Every once in a while after that, one of us would just come out and repeat the phrase, and we’d all laugh. I think my mother always found it particularly hilarious. We had to look up French twist to see what it even looked like. — Sidni Sobolik New York Today is published weekdays around 6 a.m. Sign up here to get it by email.
