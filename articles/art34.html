A representative for Mr. Bridges did not immediately return a request for comment on Tuesday. Lymphoma, according to the Mayo Clinic, is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which helps the body fight germs. Mr. Bridges did not specify what his treatment entailed, but options vary based on the type and severity of the cancer, the clinic said. Those options can include chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiation therapy. Hodgkin’s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma are the two main subtypes of lymphoma. There will be more than 77,000 new cases of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2020, according to the National Cancer Institute, accounting for 4.3 percent of all new cancer cases. Approximately 2.1 percent of people will receive a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma during their lifetime, the institute said, based on data from 2015 to 2017. In 2017 alone, more than 719,000 people were estimated to be living with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in the United States. Mr. Bridges hails from a family of actors, including his father, Lloyd, who died in 1998, and his brother, Beau. He began his acting career in the late 1950s and has appeared in more than 90 projects, according to IMDb. He’s earned seven Academy Award nominations and won the Oscar in 2010 for best performance by an actor in a leading role for “Crazy Heart.” But his role as Jeff Lebowski — a.k.a. “The Dude” — in “The Big Lebowski” (1998) earned him a cult following. In a 2017 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Bridges said he wasn’t sure if he related most to The Dude out of all of his characters. The different roles he plays, Mr. Bridges said, start with himself and he sees what lines up with the character. “You might magnify those aspects of yourself that work with the character, or keep those parts of you that don’t match to the curve,” he said. When asked what makes people adore The Dude, Mr. Bridges said: “He is who he is and doesn’t mess around with trying to be something else. It’s kind of a mystery to me.” According to IMDb, Mr. Bridges was recently filming “The Old Man,” an FX series that is set to debut on Hulu next year. “Our thoughts go out to Jeff and his family during this challenging time, and they have our love and support,” FX, Touchstone Television, Hulu and FXP said in a joint statement. “We wish him a safe and full recovery. And, as Jeff always says, ‘We are all in this together.’ Jeff, we are all in this together with you.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
