By Christina Goldbaum Small, gray rectangles show trains moving through subway tunnels in real time. Brightly colored strokes depicting each of New York City’s 26 subway lines fade when those lines go out of service. When trains are running in only one direction, those solid lines become dashes and black dots representing stations turn into triangles. Ride the New York subway, and there is a good chance it is using equipment dating to World War II. But open up the system’s new map on a phone and you will be whipped into the 21st century. The new map, which transit officials unveiled this week and say is the first of its kind in North America, is designed to show how service is running in real time and help riders navigate often complicated service disruptions caused by construction projects, train break downs and other unplanned interruptions. The map also seeks to alleviate another rider frustration by showing elevators and escalators that are out of service.
