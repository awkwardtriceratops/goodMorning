Here’s how the pros do it. By Tim McKeough There’s no way around it: When you rarely leave home, things get dirty faster. Windows are left open longer, kitchens and bathrooms are used more frequently, and bits of pencil shavings and cereal crumbs somehow manage to elude the trash bin. Keeping up with the mess can be a challenge — especially when you have only a couple of minutes to give the floors a once-over before jumping onto your next Zoom call. You may as well admit it. Your home is in need of deep cleaning. “With the house getting so much use, it really does need more attention,” said Sabrina Fierman, the vice president of the cleaning company New York’s Little Elves. We asked her and other cleaning pros for advice on what to do. Most cleaning jobs around the home can be completed with a few key items: a vacuum, a mop, microfiber or cotton terry-cloth rags (or paper towels, but they create more waste) and an all-purpose cleaner. It’s possible to make your own all-purpose cleaner, Ms. Fierman said: “Add half a cup of white vinegar, one pint of rubbing alcohol, one teaspoon of dish soap and enough water to make a gallon.” Then pour the mixture into an empty spray bottle. “This is a really good cleaning product for the whole house,” she said. “It’s eco-friendly, it’s hypoallergenic, and it’s really effective.” If you don’t have rubbing alcohol, try mixing equal parts white vinegar and water, and adding a couple of drops of dish soap, she suggested.
