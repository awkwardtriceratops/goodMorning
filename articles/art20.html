The experience made Comey sick to his stomach. “I remember the word ‘nauseous,’” Daniels recalled. The two men — Comey, a former F.B.I. director, and Daniels, an Emmy-winning actor — met in Toronto on the set of “The Comey Rule,” a two-part series debuting Sunday on Showtime, based on Comey’s 2018 memoir, “A Higher Loyalty.” Daniels plays Comey. Until then, the real Comey had made himself available by phone and email but stayed otherwise uninvolved. Eventually, though, he found time to spend a day on set. That day’s schedule, by chance, included a recreation of the now-infamous private dinner at which Comey has said that President Trump told him: “I need loyalty. I expect loyalty.” (Trump has disputed this version of events.)
