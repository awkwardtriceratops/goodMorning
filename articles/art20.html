By Megan Thee Stallion Megan Thee Stallion is an entertainer, philanthropist and entrepreneur. TRANSCRIPT What does it mean to be a woman of color? [INTERPOSING VOICES] She’s got to be strong, because that’s just the expectation. Loving herself, but not too much, because then she’s conceited. Being his lady in the street, but his freak in the sheets. Inheriting her grandmother’s love, but always loving the wrong one. Twerking for her man, but not with her friends? Being constantly told she’s too much or not enough. “The most disrespected person is the black woman.” Constantly having to prove she’s a victim, because society sides with a man. Not being able to express her traumas, because she can’t show no weakness. Is constantly told that she’s too dark, too thin, too thick, too much of a bitch. Being murdered, beaten, abused, then questioned if she evoked all of it. Is left out on the street, but becomes the flower that grows from the concrete. “Who taught you to hate yourself from the top of your head to the soles of your feet?” She marches for everyone else, riots for everyone else, dies for everyone else. She loves for everyone else, lives for everyone else, but when it comes down to her, it ain’t a [BLEEP] in sight. “The system as a whole has failed her. You’ve never been shot. You don’t know her panic. Say her name. 18. Women of color.”
