By Billy Witz As soon as the final whistle blew, signaling that last-gasp laterals would not prevent the Notre Dame football team from its biggest win in a generation — a 47-40 double-overtime defeat of top-ranked Clemson on Saturday night — a can’t-look-away scene unfolded at Notre Dame Stadium. Thousands of students leapt over brick walls, dashed past overwhelmed security guards and stormed the field, gleefully mobbing the Notre Dame players and one another. They reveled for more than 15 minutes, ignoring announcements to retreat. In normal times, a scene like this is a rite of college football. But these are not normal times. In this stripped-down pandemic football season, devoid of pageantry and sold-out stadiums, and with nearly 50 games postponed or canceled as universities struggle with the virus, the sight of thousands of mostly masked marauders creating a mosh pit at midfield was jarring enough that the NBC broadcaster Mike Tirico observed: “In the midst of the pandemic, there is pandemonium in South Bend.” To which his analyst, Tony Dungy, laughed, adding, “And not quite social distancing.” Saturday was a historic day, of course, not just for those who follow Notre Dame football, but also because the most rancorous and drawn-out presidential election of a lifetime was decided.
