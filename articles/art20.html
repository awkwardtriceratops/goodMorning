By Christopher Mele Margaret Nolan, a stage and screen actress whose gold-painted body was used as a canvas to project the opening credits of the James Bond film “Goldfinger” and who played the character Dink in the movie, died on Oct. 5 at her home in Belsize Park, London. She was 76. The cause was cancer, said her son Oscar Deeks. In a career that was predominantly in the 1960s and ’70s, Ms. Nolan appeared in numerous BBC television productions and in films, including “No Sex Please, We’re British” (1973) and “Carry On Girls” (1973). She also appeared in “A Hard Day’s Night” (1964), the musical comedy featuring the Beatles, playing an uncredited role as “Grandfather’s Girl at Casino,” according to IMDb, the entertainment database. But it was the opening title sequence of “Goldfinger” (1964), which was projected onto Ms. Nolan’s body as if it were a screen, that brought her fame. “Squeezed into a gold leather bikini, her skin painted the same shimmering hue, the statuesque starlet Margaret Nolan (41-23-37) stood still while scenes from the just-finished James Bond movie ‘Goldfinger’ were projected onto her curves,” The New York Times reported in 2005 of the film shoot, which it also described as “long and meticulous.” The movie’s title sequence went on to be a featured exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 2012-13. In an archived version of her official website, Ms. Nolan described how she was “quite unexpectedly shot into the limelight” by the movie when she was only 20. The filmmakers wanted her to be the body for the title sequence but she agreed to do it only if she were given a role in the movie. She ended up playing a masseuse named Dink who appears briefly with James Bond, played by Sean Connery. Ms. Nolan’s character in “Goldfinger” was not to be confused with the character who is completely painted in gold and dies of “skin suffocation.” That character, Jill Masterson, was played by Shirley Eaton. (That scene also prompted false accounts that the actress had died during the filming as a result of the paint.) Ms. Nolan turned down a two-year contract to publicize the film because she said she would find it difficult to live down such attention and wanted to be taken seriously as an actress. “As it transpired, I couldn’t ‘live it down’ anyway and to this day get regular fan mail from Bond fans!” she wrote.
