Race<br></h1><p id="artcont">Representative Elise Stefanik’s strenuous defense of the president has enabled her Democratic opponent to raise $5 million. Ms. Stefanik has raised even more. By Jesse McKinley During the House presidential impeachment hearings last year, a political transformation took hold: Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican known to voice her displeasure with party leadership, suddenly emerged as a powerful, outspoken proxy for President Trump. She dressed down reporters, witnesses and Democratic leaders. Her fervent defense made her into a Republican star, a chair of the president’s re-election campaign in New York and a featured speaker at the Republican National Convention in August. It also made her a target of Democratic ire, turning her re-election bid in New York’s North Country into an unusually expensive and combative race. Over the last year, Ms. Stefanik’s Democratic opponent, Tedra Cobb, has raised more than $5 million, about five times what she accumulated in 2018, when she was defeated handily by Ms. Stefanik. Much of Ms. Cobb’s money came late last year during the impeachment hearings. That windfall allowed Ms. Cobb, a former county legislator and consultant, to purchase a raft of advertisements in the 21st Congressional District, a largely rural region that stretches from Lake Ontario to Lake Champlain, bordering Canada and Vermont. The ads target Ms. Stefanik and the president on health care and the military, a major issue in a district which includes Fort Drum, particularly after reports of Russian bounties being placed on American troops. “That’s cowardice,” one veteran says in a Cobb ad that accuses Ms. Stefanik and Mr. Trump of doing nothing in reaction to the reports of the bounties. But as much as Ms. Cobb’s fortunes have been boosted by Ms. Stefanik’s notoriety among Democratic supporters, Ms. Stefanik, 36, has benefited more. She has pulled in more than $11 million in donations, twice Ms. Cobb’s war chest, and remains a prohibitive favorite. The Cook Political Report lists the district as “solid Republican,” and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee does not list her race as a possible “red-to-blue” pickup. Unlike many parts of New York, there are more Republicans than Democrats in the 21st, though a sizable chunk of the electorate are independents. Mr. Trump won all but one of the district’s 12 counties in 2016 and is expected to easily carry the district next week as well. Indeed, while Mr. Trump’s standing in his former home state is putrid — polls show that New Yorkers deeply dislike him — Ms. Stefanik said his standing among her constituents remains high. “He’s going to win this district,” she said. Ms. Stefanik has also been able to sidestep perhaps the Democrats’ most potent campaign issue — the federal handling of the coronavirus — because of the relatively low rates of infections and death in the North Country, though rates have risen in recent weeks. “I think the president has had a strong response to Covid,” the congresswoman said, noting, again, that she’s “looking at it through the lens of my district.” Ms. Cobb, however, sees things very differently, saying the pandemic has “shown us the fragility of our health care system.” “I’ve said from the beginning that I’m running against Elise Stefanik because of her record,” Ms. Cobb said, in an interview from her home in Canton, near the Canadian border. “But she chose to tie herself to this president. And the president has lied to us. Millions of people have been infected. The economy is in shambles. And she’s not held him accountable.” Some of Ms. Cobb’s most pointed critiques are focused on Ms. Stefanik’s repeated votes to overturn the Affordable Care Act, a record that she said inspired her to run in 2018, after her daughter had a health scare several years earlier. “Unfortunately, Elise Stefanik has tried to take away our health care,” she said. Ms. Stefanik first won here in 2014, making history by becoming the youngest woman ever elected to Congress at the time. (She was 30, a record since eclipsed by another congressional star, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Queens Democrat who was 29 when elected in 2018.) In doing so, she flipped a seat previously held by a Democrat, Bill Owens, who retired. Her victory in 2016 was even more impressive; she crushed her Democratic opponent, Mike Derrick, capitalizing on Mr. Trump’s fiery populist message, which resonated with voters in a district that has some of the poorest counties in the state. “Trump gave them someone to blame, and Stefanik has harnessed that,” said Alexander Cohen, an assistant professor of political science at Clarkson University in Potsdam. He added that while the district had some small cities and college towns, where more liberal voters congregate, it was still a conservative region. “No matter what the national politics is, this is a very white, very rural population,” Professor Cohen said, predicting another Stefanik victory. “And it’s all Trump banners.” Ms. Stefanik has also adopted some of Mr. Trump’s tactics, using nicknames like “Taxin’ Tedra” to describe Ms. Cobb, a practice she defended during a recent debate. That campaign strategy turned off the editorial board of The Post-Star of Glens Falls, N.Y., a prominent newspaper in the district. The paper endorsed Ms. Cobb on Sunday, after backing Ms. Stefanik four years ago. “She has allowed her substance to be subsumed by President Trump’s style, which she emulates,” the board wrote of the congresswoman. “She has compromised her character by defending his.” Ms. Stefanik has, of late, tried to create a sliver of daylight between herself and the president, stressing her bipartisanship and willingness to work across the aisle even as Mr. Trump offered her a hearty endorsement on Twitter, praising Ms. Stefanik for doing “a terrific job” and for exposing “the Radical Left’s lies!” The balancing act hints at the challenge for Ms. Stefanik, who insisted that she has criticized the president — “Some of the tweets, some of the rhetoric toward women I’ve spoken out against that,” she said — and notes she has voted against him more frequently than many of her fellow Republicans in the House. She also says that she could work with a Democratic president, noting that when she was first elected, President Barack Obama was still in office. She said she worked for him — and Mr. Trump — “very effectively.” “I think that’s what sets me apart,” she said. On Monday, Ms. Stefanik unveiled a new advertisement, entitled “Bipartisan,” featuring her wandering through a barn packed with cattle while touting her ability to work across the aisle. “Because if they can get along, so should the folks in Washington,” Ms. Stefanik says, looking at one of her bovine backers. “Right?” The cow moos. That said, there’s little doubt which president she prefers. A half-hour after her cow ad debuted, Ms. Stefanik’s campaign put out another news release, praising Mr. Trump for his support of the military and noting that Ms. Stefanik brought the president to Fort Drum for the signing of a bill that increased military pay. The release included a photograph of Ms. Stefanik, standing against a wall of uniformed troops. And standing behind her, beaming, is President Trump. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
