By Amelia Nierenberg and Adam Pasick This is the Coronavirus Schools Briefing, a guide to the seismic changes in U.S. education that are taking place during the pandemic.

Davidson College and The Chronicle of Higher Education are tracking the reopening plans of nearly 3,000 institutions: 6 percent will be online-only 27 percent will be primarily online 15 percent will be a hybrid of online and in-person 20 percent will be primarily in-person 2.5 percent will be solely in-person 6 percent are doing something else entirely 24 percent of schools have still not yet finalized their plans Struggling to salvage some normalcy — and revenue — during the pandemic, many colleges and universities are inviting students into dorms and classrooms. But that comes with strict rules: No parties. Regular coronavirus tests. Wellness pledges to self-report symptoms. And some mandatory quarantines — with some suspect meals — before students can enter the dorms. “Colleges are very risk adverse, but at the same time, they’re consumer-oriented,” said our colleague Anemona Hartocollis, who covers higher education. “They’re torn between the desire to make the students happy and the desire to preserve their own reputations.” There’s one problem with that plan: It requires students to self-police their own social distancing. At the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and Notre Dame, dozens of coronavirus cases popped up almost immediately, many of which were linked to large parties. Those schools shut down in-person education and switched to online-only classes. “If you look at the pictures, kids seem oblivious,” Anemona said. “But when you’re that age, it’s easy to just get lost in the excitement and forget.” Some schools, including Purdue University and the University of Connecticut, have begun imposing tough penalties on social distancing violations. Syracuse University, which began classes on Monday, suspended 23 people after a large outdoor gathering last week. An official warned that revelers “may have done damage enough to shut down campus, including residence halls and in-person learning, before the academic semester even begins.” The professors Julia Marcus and Jessica Gold predicted this more than a month ago in The Atlantic: “Students will get infected, and universities will rebuke them for it; campuses will close, and students will be blamed for it.” Day-to-day enforcement often falls to teaching assistants and residential advisers, who have been organizing at schools including Cornell University and the University of Utah for better protections and recognition. University officials are also relying on students to report one another. In a popular TikTok video, two students say they would rather “snitch” on their irresponsible classmates than be sent home. “If I receive word of any partying going on in the campus I attend, I’m telling,” one said (with more than a few expletives). “I spend too much money going to this school to stay in this dorm to get sent home months early because you can’t follow the rules.” College, for most students, is not just the few hours a week spent in class. Instead, it’s the thrill of friendships made over late nights in the library together, or an all-consuming commitment to an extracurricular activity. Online, this semester is a faint shadow of what a typical fall looks like. “There’s the education certification and then there’s the experience part of college,” Scott Galloway, a professor at N.Y.U., told New York Magazine in May. “The experience part of it is down to zero, and the education part has been dramatically reduced.”
