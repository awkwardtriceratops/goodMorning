By Steven Raichlen Watermelon ham. Radish prosciutto. Jerky sticks made from burdock root. It would be easy to view these recent inventions simply as fresh evidence of the veganizing of the American diet. But each is the work of a chef with a decidedly carnivorous bent. The first two were created by Will Horowitz, the omnivorously curious chef and co-owner of Ducks Eatery, in Manhattan — better known these days for the smoked goat neck and St. Louis-style pork ribs served at its outdoor taco stand. The burdock-root jerky comes from the master meat curer Jeremy Umansky, a chef and co-owner of Larder, in Cleveland, where it shares the menu (now just takeout) with house-cured pancetta, pastrami and coppa ham. Like those traditional salumi, these new foods are cured, smoked and served as charcuterie — yet they’re made without meat. Plant-based charcuterie may sound like an oxymoron. After all, “charcuterie” derives from the French words chair, which translates as flesh, and cuite, which means cooked. Here, though, the flesh arrives from the garden, not from the butcher. And fruit and vegetable charcuterie offers the allure of bright colors, intriguing textures, and flavors that are simultaneously familiar and delectably different. “We use the same ancient techniques of meat charcuterie — salting, curing, drying, fermenting and smoking,” Mr. Horowitz said. “The trick is finding the right cocktail for each vegetable.” Before the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Horowitz supplied the fast-food vegan restaurant chain By Chloe with smoked carrot “hot dogs.” (“They bite, snap, and taste like a hot dog,” Mr. Horowitz said. “We’ve sold more than 20,000 to date.”) These join a sustainable kelp jerky his company, Cured, developed for Akua Sea Greens in New York City, and a plant jerky he is working on for Country Archer Provisions, a grass-fed beef snack company in San Bernardino, Calif. Mr. Umansky is in talks with a Japanese koji manufacturer to form an American-based company that would sell his signature brand of koji-cured vegetable charcuterie. That’s not to say that carnivores have a monopoly on these new smoked and cured foods. When the chef Rich Landau and his wife, the pastry chef Kate Jacoby, opened the upscale vegan restaurant Fancy Radish in Washington, D.C., in 2018, they made a painterly vegetable charcuterie board one of their signature dishes. Waiters would bear handsome trenchers piled with crispy smoked shiitakes, pastrami-spiced carrots, deviled kohlrabi and fire-charred Chioggia beets through the dining room — back when people sat in dining rooms. “They don’t look so appetizing piled in a to-go box,” Mr. Landau said ruefully, so he now uses the individual components on the toasts and salads served on the newly pared-down menus at Fancy Radish and its sister restaurant, Vedge, in Philadelphia. Mr. Landau dislikes meat-evoking names like mushroom “bacon” and tofu “ham,” but his shiitakes certainly crunch like crisp bacon, releasing rich flavors of fat and wood smoke. He serves them with heirloom tomatoes on toast — a vegan BLT. The tofu goes on roasted-beet toasts, the ensemble perfumed with the haunting scent of wood smoke. “Our goal is not to replicate meat, but to give vegetables some of the flavors that carnivores love,” Mr. Landau said. “Our menus may be vegan, but 95 percent of our clientele are omnivores.” One of the challenges of making fruit and vegetable charcuterie is how profoundly it differs from the meat-based version. Meat consists largely of protein, which provides texture, flavor and a sense of satiation, and fat, which contributes richness and a luxurious mouthfeel. As a result, you don’t need to do much to it. Prosciutto calls for only pork and salt — as well as the time and air circulation needed to dry and cure it. (The same goes for Italian bresaola and the Swiss cured dried beef known as bündnerfleisch.) Tennessee country ham, Tyrolean speck and German Black Forest ham require only pork, salt and wood smoke.
