Vice Media, the owner of Refinery29, announced Wednesday that Ms. Oliver, who previously worked at The New York Times and Condé Nast, will start Sept. 30. She will oversee Refinery29's articles, videos, audience engagement efforts and partnerships with clothing companies and other brands. The “global” in her title is a nod to the site’s offices in New York, London and Berlin. Ms. Oliver, 38, will succeed Christene Barberich, a Refinery29 co-founder who stepped down after several former employees went public with accounts of workplace discrimination. In a social media post, one former Refinery29 staff member described “a toxic company culture where white women’s egos ruled.” At the time of the complaints, Ms. Barberich, who is white, acknowledged “the raw and personal accounts of Black women and women of color regarding their experiences inside our company,” and said, “We have to do better.” Ms. Oliver, who is Black, was the digital director of the Condé Nast beauty magazine Allure before her three-year stint at Facebook and its sibling site Instagram. At The Times, she was an editor and producer who led several early digital initiatives. In 2011, as the digital editor of Styles, she started @newyorktimesfashion, the paper’s first Instagram account. “At the time, the philosophy was Instagram didn’t bring value because it didn’t garner clicks,” Ms. Oliver said. “My philosophy was that we need to go where readers are.”
