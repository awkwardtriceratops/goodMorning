By Ben Hubbard and Hwaida Saad BEIRUT — A large fire erupted in Beirut’s port on Thursday, sending up orange flames and a huge plume of black smoke that terrified residents still recovering from the horrific port explosion that devastated entire neighborhoods last month. The fire appeared to have started in a warehouse belonging to a private company that imported cooking oil; it then spread to a stock of rubber tires, the port’s interim general manager, Bassem El-Kaissi, said in a telephone interview. “That is why you see the big black clouds,” Mr. El-Kaissi said, adding that it was too early to speculate about how the fire had begun.
