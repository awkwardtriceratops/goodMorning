By Mark Leibovich WASHINGTON — No one ever asks “What happened to Rudy Giuliani?” as he hobnobs his way through the lobby of the Trump International Hotel, a few blocks from the White House. Here, in the preferred Trump World epicenter of Washington, Rudolph W. Giuliani has full run of the place — table-hopping, touching bases, stepping outside for a cigar. “Wow! Oh, my goodness, it’s an honor sir!” said Madison Cawthorn, a Republican congressional candidate from North Carolina, upon meeting Mr. Giuliani in the lobby last month. They were introduced by the president himself, who was trailed by an entourage of usual suspects that included Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff; Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina; and of course Mr. Giuliani, for whom the hotel represents a kind of ultimate safe space, office and playground. He has been ubiquitous as ever here this week during the Republican National Convention. Mr. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, is hosting his radio show from the hotel, situated a short walk from the Andrew W. Mellon auditorium, where many of the week’s speeches take place. He is approached, photographed and thanked at all hours, as if none of his erratic and possibly illegal conduct in recent years had ever occurred. No one in this gilded lobby derides Mr. Giuliani as the loosest of President Trump’s cannons, mocks his latest televised misadventures or blames him for getting the president impeached. None of the former friends and associates he has alienated — the ones asking, “What happened to Rudy?” — cast aspersions. Here, he remains fully revered as America’s Mayor. Mr. Trump’s presidency has produced a hodgepodge of characters whose allegiance to him has gained them entree to stations they might never have known otherwise — from White House jobs, to best seller lists, to, in some cases, jail. If nothing else, Mr. Trump has given them that most potent of political drugs: relevance. No one has seized this chance with more gusto than Mr. Giuliani, whose epic career of ups and downs, feuds and outrages, has made him in some ways the quintessential creature of this sweaty habitat. On Thursday night, Mr. Giuliani will speak in a prime slot — the culminating evening of the convention. If precedent holds, he will accuse former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. of all manner of corruption and mental decline, blame China for the coronavirus crisis (if he mentions the pandemic at all), spin grim scenarios of burning cities and socialist anarchy if Mr. Biden prevails and heap flamboyant praise upon his unlikely late-career meal ticket, Mr. Trump.
