And once again, poison appears to be the culprit. By Melissa Eddy and Andrew E. Kramer BERLIN — Aleksei A. Navalny, the outspoken Russian dissident who fell into a coma last week, was a victim of poisoning, German doctors said Monday, adding him to the ranks of Russians stricken by mystery illness after drawing the wrath of Moscow. Mr. Navalny, who became ill on a domestic flight in Russia, was under round-the-clock guard at the Berlin hospital where his family transferred him Saturday after what now appears to be yet another attack signaling Russia’s status as an outlaw nation. While not able to pinpoint the exact poison, German doctors said tests showed it came from a group of chemicals known as cholinesterase inhibitors, which interfere with the nervous system. While they are used medically to treat Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia, in some forms they are also found in chemical weapons and pesticides. A Russian health ministry issued a statement challenging the German findings, saying Mr. Navalny’s symptoms were not consistent with cholinesterase inhibitors. But a doctor at the Siberian hospital where the dissident was initially taken said after the German announcement that the patient had been given an antidote often used against nerve agents. A state news agency, RIA, carried a statement from a pro-Kremlin group that took the opportunity to invoke World War II. The group, Strong Russia, criticized the German government for providing treatment for Mr. Navalny but not for elderly Russians who suffered as children during the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. “Of course, as with any sick person, we wish Navalny a quick recovery,” the statement said. “Has Berlin ever sent an air ambulance for a former detainee in the concentration camps?” German doctors said that they expected Mr. Navalny to survive. but that it was too early to gauge the long-term effects of the attack. Mr. Navalny, who has challenged President Vladimir V. Putin politically for nearly a decade, and has waged a long battle to publicize rampant official corruption, has been attacked at least twice before. One assault left him mostly blind in one eye. This time, he fell ill while returning from a trip to Siberia, where he was organizing opposition candidates and strategy for regional and local elections. His plane made an emergency landing in the Siberian city of Omsk, where he was taken to a local hospital. Mr. Navalny's family and supporters organized an air ambulance to take him to Germany, but Russian doctors delayed for nearly 48 hours, saying his medical condition was too unstable for him to be moved. That drew bitter criticism from the Navalny camp, which accused the doctors of stalling to give the toxins enough time to drain from his system. Mr. Navalny was flown to Germany at the invitation of Chancellor Angela Merkel. Though Germany enjoys strong economic and cultural ties to Russia, it has not shied from criticizing Mr. Putin’s policies, and even before Mr. Navalny arrived in Berlin, the German government appeared to be taking extra precautions to ensure his safety.
