But he knew he had to tell this “charismatic acquaintance,” for what they had was flirtatious and unstoppable; it was, as Malcolm put it, physics. As it turned out, his crush had something to share too. She was originally from India, and her parents forbade her from dating anyone who was not Indian. They dated anyway — quietly, both knowing that each day of sweetness together was drawing them closer toward the last. An excerpt from Cecilia’s Tiny Love Story: “We met on a train from Paris to Barcelona. Sitting next to one another, we argued over who could use the power outlet. (‘Sorry, I think it’s mine.’).”  An excerpt from Cecilia’s Tiny Love Story: “We met on a train from Paris to Barcelona. Sitting next to one another, we argued over who could use the power outlet. (‘Sorry, I think it’s mine.’).”  Cecilia’s train ticket — the gateway to a journey that was “a perfect, flirtatious, six hours.”  As Malcolm revealed in the episode, he and his college girlfriend are no longer together. This wasn’t much of a surprise, given that they had always been “preparing for the end.” “Every additional day felt like we had succeeded in sort of stealing it from the universe,” Malcolm said. We also got the chance to speak with Malcolm’s ex-girlfriend. In the excerpt below, she describes her last encounter with Malcolm, after their college graduation ceremony in 2018: I saw him and his family leaving, and I excused myself from the friends that I was talking to. I essentially went after him in heels. And I was running. And I was trying not to fall because they were walking fast and I was not keeping up, but I got to a point where there weren’t too many people in sight so I kind of just screamed his name. And I was like, “Malcolm!” And he turned around and he came back. We met halfway and we kind of just talked to each other really quickly. It was like, less, than a five-minute conversation because I didn’t want to keep him. He was with his family. But it was really nice. It was really nice to see him and to see him in his graduation attire. And it just felt like a reunion after four months of me not being in his presence. It was bittersweet, for sure it was bittersweet. This excerpt has been condensed and edited for clarity.
