By Mihir Zaveri and Ashley Southall Dozens of New York City police officers charged into a group of people standing near an intersection in the West Village on Saturday evening and arrested several of them, in a chaotic scene that stunned outdoor diners and other onlookers. Members of the group said they were walking toward a nearby police precinct to complain and stage a protest after officers had broken up an earlier demonstration at Washington Square Park. As the group neared the precinct, officers confronted them at Hudson Street and West 10th Street. Videos of the police action circulated widely on Sunday, prompting sharp criticism from elected officials and activists and on social media that the officers had used unnecessary force. The videos show a large group of police officers, including several on bikes, lining up across the street from a small group of people who appear to be standing on a median between the street and the sidewalk. Several people are dining outdoors at nearby restaurants. Several members of the group appear to be filming the officers. An amplified voice can be heard saying that people cannot lawfully walk in the street or obstruct the sidewalk, before several officers suddenly rush across the street and begin arresting people in the group as other people scramble to get away from the area. A spokeswoman for the Police Department said that officers were responding to a “large disorderly group obstructing vehicular traffic.” She said that 12 people were taken into custody and eight were given tickets for disorderly conduct. The spokeswoman confirmed that officers had initially responded to the park after receiving noise complaints about loud music. Four others were arrested and face charges including resisting arrest and being pedestrians on the roadway. Three of the people face charges of “obstructing governmental administration,” the spokeswoman said, after they tried to prevent officers from conducting arrests. The arrests came in a period during which the Police Department has drawn criticism over the way it has responded to protests against police aggression and systemic racism following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The city cut the police budget and shifted funds away from the department, but many activists have been pushing for deeper reductions. Corey Johnson, the New York City Council speaker, said on Sunday that the police officers’ actions in the West Village were “unacceptable.” “The right to protest is sacrosanct,” he wrote on Twitter. “Or at least it should be. We keep seeing incidents that show this right being disregarded.” At the protest at Washington Square Park on Saturday, which featured arts and crafts, music and dancing, organizers said they were trying to bring awareness to efforts to get justice for Breonna Taylor, who was fatally shot by Louisville police officers in March. Organizers were also trying to build support for universal basic education, income and health care. David Ortiz, 28, one of the organizers, said the event had been going for about three hours when a huge group of police officers arrived and seized the D.J.’s equipment. A police spokeswoman confirmed the equipment had been seized. “It looked like a raid,” said Les Flagler, a co-organizer of the event. The group decided to march toward the Sixth Precinct station house a few blocks away, stopping at restaurants to tell patrons and owners what occurred and to ask for their help. When they reached the corner of Hudson Street and West 10th Street, police officers had surrounded the intersection, organizers said. Then the officers rushed in, they said. Both Mr. Ortiz and Mr. Flagler were among those arrested. Organizers planned to hold another rally in the park on Sunday to call attention to the episode. Molly Dillon, who was passing the intersection after attending a wedding near the Hudson River Park, said the police did not appear to be provoked before they rushed into the group. Ms. Dillon, a policy adviser to State Senator Alessandra Biaggi, said the group did not appear to be part of a protest and she did not see anyone standing in the street. She said people were tripping and falling as they scrambled to get away from the area. “In addition to the disproportionate response, it was totally unprovoked,” she said. Ms. Biaggi, who represents parts of the Bronx and Westchester, said early Sunday morning that there “must be consequences for this” and said that she would be following up with Mayor Bill de Blasio. Mr. de Blasio’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. State Senator Brad Hoylman, whose district includes the area where the arrests took place, said his office had contacted the Police Department about the officers’ actions, which he called “unacceptable.” “The bottom line is that on a beautiful Saturday evening, bystanders and peaceful protesters in the Village were charged at by police and thrown to the ground in a really disturbing escalation of force by law enforcement,” he said. He said that diners and bystanders were shaken, and that a restaurant was forced to end dinner service early. He said the police “seem not to understand that there’s such a fragile trust in law enforcement that is weakening right before our eyes.” He noted that many of the officers in the video were not wearing masks. “It’s bad modeling for New Yorkers, and I think most people wouldn’t approach an officer for help if they weren’t wearing a mask,” he said. “It’s really sending a poor message.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
