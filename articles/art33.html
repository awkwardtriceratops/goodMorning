RIGHT NOW Hurricane Zeta, the fifth named storm to strike Louisiana this year, has left more than 350,000 people without power. Hurricane Zeta, a powerful Category 2 storm, made landfall on Wednesday afternoon in southeastern Louisiana, bringing heavy rains and damaging winds to a state that has been repeatedly clobbered by hurricanes this season. The storm made landfall near the fishing village of Cocodrie, La., then quickly moved northeast through New Orleans and along the Mississippi coast. “It’s going to be quick, but it’s going to be brutal,” said Collin Arnold, director of the New Orleans Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. Zeta made landfall about 65 miles south-southwest of New Orleans at 4 p.m. Central time, making it the fifth named storm to strike the state this year, with about a month left in the hurricane season. The previous record of four was set in 2002, said Philip Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State University. Hurricane Zeta is expected to make landfall in the United States Wednesday. By 7 p.m. Central time, the storm had left more than 350,000 people without power in southeastern Louisiana, according to poweroutage.us, and caused significant damage to some structures. According to local news reports, power lines have been toppled across the region, and high winds ripped the roofs completely off some homes. Mayor LaToya Cantrell of New Orleans told WDSU-TV that one person received minor injuries after a building collapsed on Washington Avenue. Kevin Gilmore, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Louisiana, said at 7:30 p.m. that the northern eyewall of the storm was north of New Orleans, but that the city “is not out of the woods just yet.” Winds from the rear of the hurricane could pick up as the storm moves further north. The Mississippi coast is expected to receive strong winds and heavy rain for several more hours, with a continued risk of tornadoes. The National Weather Service has heard “many reports” of tree damage and structural damage, Mr. Gilmore said, though the extent of the impact remains unclear. The Lafourche Parish Sheriff’s Office reported on Twitter that property damage, including downed power lines and trees, were reported by residents just minutes after the storm touched land. A video posted by the Sheriff’s Office showed ripping winds and sheets of rain blowing across the road in the town of Cut Off. The office implored residents to stay inside until the storm passed. A hurricane warning was in effect Wednesday for a stretch of coast from Morgan City, La., to the Mississippi-Alabama border and the metropolitan New Orleans area. Storm surges along the Mississippi coast could reach as high as 11 feet. The storm was expected to make a second landfall along the Mississippi coast on Wednesday evening, then move across the Southeastern and Eastern United States on Thursday, dumping up to six inches of rain in some locations. The city of New Orleans sent regular warnings to residents via text message on Wednesday. And officials took a variety of precautions in anticipation of a deluge. The Lower Mississippi River closed to vessels at 2 a.m. Wednesday; the Port of New Orleans was also closed. Flood-protection crews were closing the gates that prevent storm surge from entering the city’s network of drainage canals. City buses stopped running at noon. Many offices and stores also shut down at noon. As a result, grocery store checkout lines were lengthy on Wednesday morning as people bought bread, canned goods and meat to put on a gas grill. Shoppers also stocked up on bottled water. Many residents who live near the Gulf of Mexico in areas unprotected by levees headed to higher ground on Wednesday; other stalwarts who live in raised houses planned to weather the storm within their homes, knowing that the storm surge likely will push several feet of water into their streets and communities before the water recedes. On Wednesday morning, as a light rain fell, Zé da Luz, 65, stood outside her neighbor’s house in New Orleans’ Ninth Ward discussing what was expected with this fast-moving storm and the city’s drainage system. “We’re supposed to get about four to six inches of rain, but within a few hours, so we know that will overwhelm the pumps. We’ll have street flooding for sure,” Ms. da Luz said. She planned to make a big batch of stewed okra and shrimp on her gas stove, which will work even if power fails. As Hurricane Zeta took aim at parts of Louisiana and Florida’s Panhandle on Wednesday, election officials in Florida planned to close some early voting centers to prepare for the storm. Louisiana, meanwhile, ended its 10 days of early voting on Tuesday, just ahead of the storm’s arrival, with total early voting numbers much higher than in the 2016 election, said John Couvillon, a pollster in Baton Rouge who studies voter turnout. More than 960,000 people voted early in Louisiana, up from more than 530,000 in 2016. Officials in New Orleans are now discussing alternative polling locations if expected power outages continue into next week, the city’s mayor, LaToya Cantrell, said. More than 90,000 people in the city voted early. “We want to keep those lines and the accessibility right there for our folks to exercise their right and, of course, let their voices be heard,” Ms. Cantrell said at a news conference Wednesday. In a news conference on Wednesday, Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said power restoration efforts will be prioritized where there are polling locations. The U.S. Postal Service said Wednesday that there have been some temporary closures of post office locations and suspensions of operations in Louisiana. Other mail collection boxes in the Gulf Coast area may also be temporarily inaccessible, including in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Early voting sites for thousands in staunchly Republican areas in Florida’s Panhandle — Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa Counties — will close early Wednesday. Officials intend to reopen Thursday morning to secure the sites and assess any damage. Florida is a key battleground state that is diverse but leans conservative. In Santa Rosa County alone, more than 73 percent of the county’s almost 90,000 ballots were cast were for President Trump in 2016. Elections officials in Santa Rosa and Okaloosa Counties said that they had already exceeded the state’s expectations for early voting, including extra days and hours than the minimum required by state laws. “We’ve offered above and beyond what the statute requires,” said Tappie Villane, the supervisor of elections of Santa Rosa County. “Voters have had ample opportunity if they want to early vote.” Alabama, too, is expected to feel some of the impact from the storm — but officials do not expect effects on voting. Although the state does not offer early voting at precincts, it does offer absentee ballots that can be mailed or dropped off to county absentee election managers, said John Merrill, the secretary of state. More than 240,000 absentee ballots have been returned, beating the previous record of 89,000 ballots, Mr. Merrill said. Officials in Alabama will not begin opening ballots to tabulate results until Election Day, so tabulation delays from the storm are unlikely. “We want to be prepared, but in our preparation, we’re going to make sure we follow the law,” Mr. Merrill said. The strength of Zeta as it headed toward the Gulf Coast is unusual: During this time of year, only three other Category 2 storms are known to have made landfall in the continental United States — in 1899, 1935 and 1985 — according to Philip Klotzbach, a research scientist at the department of atmospheric science at Colorado State University. This storm, with its predicted storm surge of six to nine feet, is “going to be pretty serious,” Dr. Klotzbach said. And since it appears to be headed toward densely populated areas, “its impacts are going to be felt by a lot more people” than the storms this year that struck farther west. This storm is also breaking records because of where it is happening. Zeta, according to Matt Lanza, a meteorologist and managing editor of Space City Weather, is the strongest storm so far west in the Gulf this late in the season. By this point in the year, the Gulf west of New Orleans has generally calmed down, he said. “I’ve been kind of flabbergasted watching this today,” he said. Climate change, along with its tendency to make hurricanes more prone to cause intense flooding, may contribute to rapid intensification of storms, Dr. Klotzbach said, and “we do expect to see more of those in the future.” Hurricane Michael, for example, which in 2018 hit the Florida Panhandle with devastating force after a surprising intensification, fed on unusually warm waters in the Gulf. But Zeta is intensifying largely because nothing is stopping it; the wind shear that can tear up storms, and which is often fairly pronounced by this time of year, is weak at the moment, Dr. Klotzbach said. Haiyan Jiang, an associate professor in the department of earth and environment at Florida International University, said, “This was a very rapid intensification, especially during the past six hours,” which she found “kind of surprising since the storm is making landfall.” Mr. Lanza noted that Hurricanes Laura and Sally went through rapid intensification before hitting the Louisiana coast this year. “Nothing we’ve seen in the last couple of years goes against that,” he said. Climate change may not always reveal itself in an obvious way, he said, but “it’s going to be these little nudges, things that add up incrementally over time.” In the past 15 years, at least three hurricanes that hit in October were destructive, according to the National Hurricane Center. Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Sandy in 2012 and Michael in 2018 resulted in many deaths and billions of dollars in damage. Most hurricanes that form in October and November have their origins in the Caribbean, as Hurricane Zeta did, said Dan Kottlowski, a lead hurricane and tropical storm expert at AccuWeather. “The later you get into the season, the more likely these storms stay south of the U.S.,” Mr. Kottlowski said in a statement. “But this year has featured a stronger than normal Bermuda Azores High pressure area that has forced more storms into the Gulf of Mexico. That has lingered through October.” Water temperatures begin to cool during the latter half of October, which causes storms aiming for the United States later in the season to be weaker, Mr. Kottlowski said. But they can still be destructive. Hurricane Wilma was once one of the costliest hurricanes in U.S. history, causing an estimated $21 billion in damage when it made landfall in southwestern Florida, according to a tropical cyclone report from the Hurricane Center. Hurricane Sandy caused at least 147 deaths, including 72 in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States. Hurricane Michael caused 16 deaths — seven in Florida — and $25 billion in damage. Because Louisiana sits at a crucial junction within the Mississippi Flyway, which stretches from the Arctic to South America, late-season hurricanes can delay or cause detours for birds heading to warmer climes. In other words, Zeta may be bad news for wildlife. As the hurricane blows through the Gulf of Mexico, it could slam into flocks of small warblers, vireos and indigo buntings, all of which are poised to cross the water at this time of year, said Erik Johnson, director of bird conservation with Audubon Louisiana. “A storm could be devastating for a migratory songbird that fuels up just enough to make it across the Gulf,” Mr. Johnson said, noting that some flocks might also delay takeoff by a few more days in places like Louisiana’s Barataria Preserve, where migratory birds stop to eat hackberries and seeds before they take off for South America. There are other wildlife concerns, too. In some national park wildlife areas, storm surge waters can temporarily push alligators closer to pathways and buildings. “Once the alligators go back home, we open back up,” noted Dave Barak, a National Park Service park ranger. Zeta brought torrential rains when it slammed into the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico on Monday night. It was a Category 1 hurricane at the time, and downgraded to a tropical storm on Tuesday morning. The storm had caused some power outages in at least two Mexican states and pushed sand onto roadways. The storm’s surf were so great that destroyed turtle eggs were found on Playa Ballenas. The devastation this year has been attributed in part to a changing climate, which has made hurricanes wetter and slower. But climate scientists said the series of storms in Louisiana could also be blamed on simple bad luck. “It’s kind of like flipping a coin and getting heads five times in a row — it happens,” said James P. Kossin, a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, adding that “it’s not that surprising” given the size of the Gulf and the randomness of weather factors. Along the Gulf Coast, veterans of hurricanes tend to take Category 1 storms in stride. There was also the added advantage that late-season storms, like Zeta, typically move a lot faster than an early-season storm that can stall for 10 to 12 hours, overwhelming areas with winds and rain. And in New Orleans, there is concern that low-level hurricanes can be more damaging than predicted. Even the weakest hurricanes can cause hardship or at least discomfort, as the wind and rain knock out electricity and damage buildings. Any significant rainfall in the city is worrisome because of the city’s drainage system, a series of pumps that lift water out of the bowl-shaped city through power supplied partly by century-old turbines. On Sunday, the city’s Sewerage and Water Board announced that Turbine 4, one of the system’s largest, “unexpectedly went offline,” prompting concerns that water in low-lying areas of the city would be pumped out more slowly.
