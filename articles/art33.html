Dr. Anthony Fauci and other top U.S. health officials testified before a Senate panel. RIGHT NOW Dr. Robert Redfield, the C.D.C. director, said that it could take until July to get the entire American public vaccinated. There should be 700 million doses available by April, he said — enough to vaccinate all Americans if two doses are required. Buoyed by positive results in its earlier studies, Johnson & Johnson has begun the final stage of clinical trials for its coronavirus vaccine. Although they started a couple of months behind the other so-called Phase 3 trials in the United States, Johnson & Johnson’s trials, which began on Monday, will be the largest, with plans to enroll 60,000 participants. And this experimental vaccine may have considerable advantages over some of its competitors, experts said. It does not need to be stored in subzero temperatures, and may require just one dose instead of two. “It would be fabulous if we had something at a single dose,” said Dr. Judith Feinberg, the vice chairwoman for research in medicine at West Virginia University, who was not involved in the study. Only Phase 3 trials, which compare the effects of a vaccine with those of a placebo, can determine if a single dose is indeed effective, Dr.  Feinberg said. If it works, that could greatly speed efforts to curb the pandemic. “The real issue here is time,” she said. “We’ve got to vaccinate a lot of people really quickly.” At a news conference on Tuesday, Dr. Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer of Johnson & Johnson, said the company might be able to determine by the end of the year if the vaccine is safe and effective. The company will soon be posting a manuscript online with data from the earlier phases of its trials, he said. “Big news. Numerous great companies are seeing fantastic results. @FDA must move quickly!” President Trump said in a Twitter post Wednesday morning. Mr. Trump’s enthusiasm and push for a vaccine has raised concerns among health experts that he will try to interfere with a testing and review process that was designed to be thorough to ensure a potential vaccine is both effective and safe. Johnson & Johnson’s experimental vaccine uses an adenovirus to carry a gene from the coronavirus into human cells. The cell then produces coronavirus proteins, which can potentially prime the immune system to fight off a later infection by the virus. Adenovirus vaccines must be kept refrigerated but not frozen, unlike the two front-runner vaccines, by Moderna and Pfizer, which depend on bits of genetic material known as mRNA. The freezing requirement could make the distribution of those vaccines difficult, especially to places without advanced medical facilities. Moderna and Pfizer’s vaccines also require two jabs given a few weeks apart, a significant logistical hurdle. “I mean, just think about yourself — how much easier would it be for you to go to your local doctor or your local drugstore, and be once and done?” said Dr. Daniel Barouch, a virologist at  Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who helped develop the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Amid growing questions about the Trump administration’s efforts to bend scientific decision-making to the president’s advantage — and just a day after the U.S. surpassed 200,000 virus-related deaths — four of the top doctors leading the government’s pandemic response testified in the Senate. Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said that science would guide decisions by staff members about granting  emergency approval to any Covid-19 vaccine, and that the F.D.A. “will not permit any pressure from anyone to change that.” His agency, he added, will seek guidance from a panel of outside experts and the process “will be transparent and independent.” His remarks came as the F.D.A. planned to issue stricter guidelines for the emergency authorization of any new coronavirus vaccine, which would add a new layer of caution to the vetting process, even as Mr. Trump has insisted a vaccine will be ready as early as next month. The guidelines may be formally released as early as this week if approved by the White House, and would recommend that clinical trial data be vetted by a committee of independent experts before the F.D.A. takes action, according to several people familiar with the draft. Dr. Hahn and the other three doctors testifying Wednesday —  Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s leading infectious disease expert; Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and Adm. Brett P. Giroir, the testing czar — told the Senate panel, that if the F.D.A. gave emergency approval to a vaccine, they would take it and recommend that their families do so as well. It was an echo of an earlier era when Jonas Salk, the inventor of the polio vaccine, tested it on himself and his children before giving it to patients. “If a vaccine is shown to be and proven to be and authorized by the F.D.A. to be safe and effective, I certainly would take that vaccine. I would recommend to my family that they take that vaccine,” Dr. Fauci said. Dr. Redfield also faced questions on his agency’s guidelines for testing, issued last month, that suggested certain people exposed to the virus did not need to be screened. Internal documents show the guidance had been posted on the C.D.C.’s website despite serious objections from agency scientists, and the agency reversed it last week after widespread criticism. On Wednesday, Dr. Redfield said, however, that the intent of the agency’s guidance “was never to limit testing of asymptomatic individuals.” And while he said the “original guidance was produced with “full engagement of individuals at C.D.C.,” he did not dispute that it had not undergone the agency’s scientific review, and said the final guidance was “a cooperative document” produced with participation from Adm. Brett Giroir and the coronavirus task force. Dr. Redfield also said that preliminary results from a study on the prevalence of Covid-19 “show that more than 90 percent of population remains susceptible” to the disease. Looming over the hearing is the threat of a public scolding by Mr. Trump if he hears testimony he doesn’t like. Last week the president rebuked Dr. Redfield after he told a Senate committee that a vaccine would not be widely available until the middle of next year and that masks were so vital in fighting the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, that they may be even more important than a vaccine. Senator Lamar Alexander, chairman of the committee, urged Congress to start planning for the next pandemic, warning that experts say one could come as soon as next year. “We must act now to stop the cycle of panic, neglect, panic,” he said. Dr. Fauci told the committee that federal scientists are beginning to study so-called “long-haulers” — people who suffer long-term side effects of coronavirus infection, including fatigue, fever, neurological problems and cognitive abnormalities. In addition, scientists have found “a disturbing number of individuals” who appeared to have recovered have inflammation of the heart, he said. Senator Elizabeth Warren raised questions about whether Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the former drug company executive overseeing the federal vaccine project, has a conflict of interest, noting that as a private contractor he is not required to disclose whether he has investments in drug companies. Dr. Hahn told Ms. Warren that he did not know about Dr. Slaoui’s conflicts, but that he has drawn a “very bright line” between the vaccine project and the F.D.A. The Senate hearing  follows upheaval within the federal Department of Heath and Human Services, whose top spokesman, Michael R. Caputo, took medical leave last week after delivering an outlandish rant on Facebook Live in which he accused C.D.C. scientists of sedition, promoted conspiracy theories and warned of armed revolt. Mr. Caputo’s Facebook appearance came after the revelation that he and his science adviser, Dr. Paul Alexander, had tried to pressure the agency to revise or delay its weekly scientific reports. Dr. Alexander has since left the department.   The split-screen scenes of the hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and a ceremony at the Supreme Court honoring the life of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg — just blocks away from each other — formed a striking Washington image.  The Metropolitan Opera announced Wednesday that the still-untamed pandemic has forced it to cancel its entire 2020-21 season, prolonging one of the gravest crises in its 137-year history and keeping the nation’s largest performing arts organization dark until next September. The decision is likely to send ripples of concern through New York and the rest of the country as arts institutions grapple with the question of when it will be safe again to perform indoors. Far from being a gilded outlier, the Met may well prove to be a bellwether. The outbreak has kept the 3,800-seat opera house closed since mid-March, sapping it of more than $150 million in revenue and leaving roughly 1,000 full-time employees, including its world-class orchestra and chorus, furloughed without pay since April. Now, with the virus still too much of a threat to allow for a reopening on New Year’s Eve, as planned, Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, is making plans to adapt to a world transformed by the pandemic, including by trying to curb the company’s high labor costs. “The future of the Met relies upon it being artistically as powerful as ever, if not more so,” Mr. Gelb said in an interview. “The artistic experiences have to be better than ever before to attract audiences back. Where we need to cut back is costs.” The Met plans to return to its gilded stage next September with Terence Blanchard’s “Fire Shut Up in My Bones,” the first time that it will mount an opera by a Black composer — a long-overdue milestone, and part of a new focus on contemporary works alongside the ornate productions of canonical pieces for which the company is famous. The Met will also experiment with earlier curtain times, shortening some operas and offering more family fare as it tries to lure back post-pandemic audiences. But one of its most difficult hurdles may play out offstage, as the Met goes to its powerful labor unions to seek concessions it says will be necessary to its survival. New York City will furlough more than 9,000 employees this year as it grapples with substantial budget deficits wrought by the pandemic. Mayor Bill de Blasio made the announcement on Wednesday, a week after he revealed he would furlough much of his City Hall staff, himself included. Today’s action will save the city about $21 million, on top of the roughly $860,000 to be saved with the City Hall furlough. The furloughs will last five workdays, and employees will have to take them between October and March 2021. These actions will not move the budgetary needle much. This year the city closed its $88 billion budget with an unspecified $1 billion in labor savings. The mayor’s office has since been negotiating with labor unions to find those savings, and the furloughs indicate the kinds of measures the city will have to consider if it wants to avoid 22,000 layoffs. “No one wants to see layoffs, but unfortunately they’re still on the table,” Mr. de Blasio said Wednesday. “This at least gives us a little more relief while we continue those conversations and try and find a larger solution.” Andrew Rein, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group, said the city still had a lot of work to do. GLOBAL ROUNDUP Plastic face shields do little to contain the spread of microscopic airborne particles created by such activities as talking, singing or sneezing, according to recent research from Japan that modeled the diffusion of respiratory aerosols on the world’s fastest supercomputer. The shields, which have been marketed as an alternative to face masks to guard against the coronavirus, do almost nothing to stop the spread of microscopic airborne droplets that are increasingly understood to be a major vector for spreading the disease, according to a recent study by researchers at the Riken Center for Computational Science, a research institute based in Kobe, Japan. Face shields may be useful for protecting the wearer from the droplets generated by others, but are almost completely ineffective at protecting others from the wearer’s own droplets, according to Makoto Tsubokura, a professor at Kobe University and the lead researcher on a team that is using Japan’s world-beating supercomputer to better understand how to defend against the coronavirus. While the face shields can block the spread of some large droplets, they are essentially incapable of capturing droplets five microns or smaller, according to simulations run by researchers on Fugaku, the Japanese supercomputer currently considered the world’s fastest. Japan was one of the first countries to understand that tiny airborne particles were one of the most likely methods of transmission for the virus, which has killed nearly one million people worldwide, according to a New York Times database. The country promoted face masks as the first line of defense against the virus. Since the pandemic’s early days, health experts in Japan have cautioned people to avoid conditions known as the three C’s — closed spaces, crowded places and close contact — thought to increase the risk of exposure to an airborne dose of the disease. The simulation conducted by researchers at Riken demonstrated that face masks — whether manufactured or handmade — are far more effective at blocking the diffusion of airborne droplets than face shields. In other news around the world: The regional government of Madrid said on Wednesday that it would request “urgent military and logistics” support from the central government to help contain the spread of the virus. Spain is in the midst of a spike in cases centered in the capital, parts of which were again put under lockdown this week. Also Wednesday, the deputy head of the Madrid region, Ignacio Aguado, told a news conference that about 220 additional police officers would need to be deployed to help ensure residents respect the latest quarantine and lockdown rules. Foreigners with valid residence permits for work, personal matters and family reunions in China will be allowed to enter the country again without having to apply for new visas starting next week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. Such foreign nationals have been barred since March. Saudi Arabia said it would allow up to 6,000 Saudi citizens and residents a day to visit Mecca’s Grand Mosque beginning Oct. 4, according to The Associated Press. The quota is set to rise later in the month.  The government said that Muslim travelers from outside the country could be allowed to visit the holy city starting in November. About 600 pubs that serve only drinks can reopen in Northern Ireland on Wednesday for the first time in six months. Pubs that serve food were allowed to reopen in July. But they may face new restrictions after Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain announced this week that pubs, bars and restaurants in England would be required to close by 10 p.m. starting Thursday. The same measure will be applied in Scotland starting Friday. Northern Ireland will decide whether to implement a curfew on drinks and hospitality venues on Thursday. U.S. ROUNDUP In March, New York City became the epicenter of the virus in the United States. Months of hardship and numbness followed: Nearly 24,000 people in the city have died as the pandemic preyed on its vulnerabilities. But six months later, as the infection rate has dropped to only 1 percent, small transformations and vibrant signs of renewal have revealed the grit and gifts of those who stayed as others scurried to second homes. The prospect of a second wave is frightening. And already, attempts at returning to offices, schools and sports have been problematic. Signs of real progress have been slow. And yes, many have left. But in Central Park, weddings and birthday parties, once tucked away in rented halls, have spilled out into the open — the celebrations jubilant though everyone is wearing masks. A struggling Greek restaurateur in Queens has added ambience to curbside tables with lanterns and bouquets. Top designers like Christian Siriano and Naeem Khan have included mask-making in their repertoire. In Brooklyn, a trio of D.J.s throw digital parties to raise money for the owners of dance lounges, while a coffee shop in Bedford-Stuyvesant stocks four community refrigerators with fresh fruits and vegetables for the hungry. And industrious entrepreneurs and street vendors have redesigned business plans to stay afloat. “There are still these beautiful moments that you don’t have in any other place in the world, like walking in Prospect Park and stumbling upon a jazz concert or a brass band,” said Dominique Nisperos, 37, a comedian and sociologist from Bedford-Stuyvesant who spent two months recovering from Covid-19. “The lows of the pandemic have been really low, but what’s been my saving grace has been the people of New York.” The sense of renewal comes as New York City’s Health Department warned on Tuesday that Covid-19 was spreading at increasing levels in several neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens, a worrisome indicator after a couple of months of declining or flat transmission. City health officials said that they were especially concerned about a clear uptick in transmission among some of the city’s Hasidic communities, which were devastated by Covid-19 in the spring but had seen few cases in the summer. “This is something that requires urgent action,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday, adding that the city health department had closed two yeshivas in connection with the uptick and that police officers would step up enforcement of public health rules. In other news from around the United States: Students in Miami-Dade County, the fourth-largest school district in the country and the largest in Florida, will be able to choose to return to their classrooms next month under a plan approved by the school board after a marathon two-day meeting. New guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that traditional trick-or-treating this Halloween would carry more risk than other ways of celebrating the holiday. The agency listed activities in three categories: higher risk, moderate risk and lower risk. Pumpkin carving with members of the same household and virtual costume contests were classified as lower risk, while trick-or-treating door to door and attending a crowded indoor haunted house were listed as higher risk. On the list of moderate risks was “trick-or-treating where individually wrapped goodie bags are lined up for families to grab and go while continuing to social distance.” Mexico, Brazil, Peru and other Latin American countries — hobbled by weak health systems, severe inequality and government indifference — have some of the most deaths per capita from the virus in the world. In the Iztapalapa neighborhood of Mexico City, The Times’s Azam Ahmed witnessed some of the devastation by visiting the Central de Abasto, the largest produce market in the Western Hemisphere. This is part of what he wrote: The man in the vegetable stall next to Christopher Arriaga’s died first. A longtime customer was next, then another. A few days later, an elderly carrot vendor got sick and died within the week. Soon, the virus was storming the vast, gridded passages of the Central de Abasto, and Mr. Arriaga’s father fell ill, too. Dozens in the market died, perhaps hundreds. Not even the government knows for sure. “There is this moment when you start to see people dying, and the stress begins to destroy you,” Arriaga, 30 said. “It made me realize what a trapped animal feels like.” The market became the epicenter of the epicenter, the teeming heart of a neighborhood that has registered more Covid deaths than any other part of the capital, which is itself the center of the national crisis. In Iztapalapa, it was clear from the start that the virus would strike hard. Of all the districts in the Mexican capital, it is the most densely populated, with some two million people packed into 45 square miles of heaving commerce and virtually uninterrupted construction. Poverty circumscribes life, with chronic water shortages. Hundreds of thousands live, day by day, far more fearful of hunger than any virus. Over the months, a deep-seated skepticism among people like Mr. Arriaga turned to shock, and eventually to resignation, as their neighbors, friends and loved ones died and their neighborhood became ground zero for the outbreak. The virus left few lives untouched in Iztapalapa, if not by illness then by economic distress. Starvation haunted people who had never considered themselves poor, and rituals that had bound the community for generations were scrapped, including one of the biggest Christian celebrations in Latin America, which was canceled for the first time in more than 150 years. A new reality set in for many: A prolonged economic shutdown was clearly impossible. People could wear masks, and distance as much as possible, but almost no one could afford to stay home. They had to keep working. Mr. Arriaga’s own attempts to stay away from the market lasted only a month before he blew through his life savings and trudged back to work in fear. “I’ve got nothing left,” he said on a recent weekend, bracing himself for another long night in the market. “It’s either go out there and face the virus, or sit here and starve.” Every day, New York Times journalists are chronicling and debunking false and misleading information that is going viral online. Today, Adam Satariano, a tech reporter, looks at a new study that found that young people are more likely to believe misinformation about the coronavirus: As public health officials raise alarms about surging coronavirus cases among young people, new research suggests that Americans under 25 are most likely to believe virus-related misinformation about the severity of the disease and how it originated. In a survey of 21,196 people in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, researchers identified a clear generational divide. Respondents 18 to 25 had an 18 percent probability of believing a false claim, compared with 9 percent for those over 65, according to the study, conducted by researchers from Harvard University, Rutgers University, Northeastern University and Northwestern University. The results diverge from past research that said older people were more likely to share false news articles on social media. Last year, a paper published in Science found that people over the age of 65 were seven times as likely as those ages 30 to 44, the youngest group included in that survey, to share articles from websites that spread false information during the 2016 presidential campaign. In the virus study, people were questioned to gauge their acceptance of 11 false claims. Those included false claims that the virus originated in people who ate bats, that taking antibiotics protects against the disease and that only people 60 or older are at risk of being infected. “Across the 11 false claims,” the report said, “we find a clear pattern: The older the age group, the lower the average level of belief in false claims.” The death of Jamain Stephens, the college senior and football player who died from a blood clot after being hospitalized with Covid-19 and pneumonia, devastated his community and rippled through the sports landscape as he is believed to be the first college football player whose death can be traced to the virus. Most colleges around the country, including California University, a small college in southwestern Pennsylvania that plays at the N.C.A.A. Division II level and that Mr. Stephens attended, have canceled or postponed fall sports because of the coronavirus pandemic. But some schools have forged ahead, hoping to salvage billions in TV revenue, and perhaps some ticket sales. The Big Ten Conference said last week that it would play football in October, reversing an earlier decision to wait until at least next year. The Pac-12 is considering a similar pivot. Part of the rationale for playing is that young athletes, even if they carry and spread the virus, are highly unlikely to die from it. While that is largely true, the virus can have other serious effects, and the risks have been shown to be more severe for Black people and those with large body mass indexes, like many linemen. So as cases among college football players persist — Louisiana State Coach Ed Orgeron said last week that “most” of his players had contracted the virus — Stephens’s death may not be the last. More than 10,000 players are expected to suit up this fall.
