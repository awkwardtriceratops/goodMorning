C.E.O.s of Facebook and Twitter get questioned by lawmakers on election misinformation. A website funded by right-wing groups gains followers with debunked voting fraud claims. Trump has amplified voting falsehoods in over 300 tweets since election night. The New York Times A catchphrase winking at an unfounded voter fraud conspiracy in the presidential election trended on Twitter on Tuesday morning as President Trump’s allies continued to contest the outcome of the election, which has been called for Joseph R. Biden Jr. The phrase, “Release the Kraken,” appeared on Twitter’s trending topics list on Tuesday, collecting nearly 100,000 tweets, pushed mostly by conservatives and far-right internet personalities. The conspiracy stems from a Fox Business Network appearance last Friday by Sidney Powell, a lawyer for the former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn. During an interview with the host Lou Dobbs, Ms. Powell claimed that the president’s team had voluminous evidence that it planned to release to overturn election results in key states. “We are talking about hundreds of thousands of votes,” Ms. Powell said in the interview. “President Trump won this election in a landslide.” Ms. Powell has not yet provided any evidence and did not respond to a request for comment. The New York Times has called election officials in every U.S. state and found no evidence of voter fraud. At a later point in the interview, Ms. Powell asserted that the voter fraud had been “organized and conducted with the help of Silicon Valley people, the big tech companies, the social media companies and even the media companies.” “I’m going to release the Kraken,” Ms. Powell said. She did not respond to a request for comment. The video gathered steam over the weekend and began to trend on Twitter by Tuesday morning. One video of the television appearance, which was posted to YouTube on Saturday, gained 1.3 million views in four days. The views were driven by over 160,000 likes and shares on Facebook, 81 percent of which happened in private Facebook groups and on users’ private feeds according to data from CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned social media analytics tool. Twitter, Facebook and YouTube did not immediately comment. The false narrative has also been promoted by far right personalities with track records of spreading misinformation, such as David J. Harris Jr., who has shared false conspiracies about the coronavirus, and Austen Fletcher, a right-wing internet personality who spread false rumors of voter fraud in Michigan that in reality could be attributed to run-of-the-mill clerical errors. Mr. Harris did not respond. When asked for comment, Mr. Fletcher said: “Sidney Powell is a brilliant woman… When ‘the kraken’ is released America will remember who sought the truth and who asked no questions.” By Stephanie Saul and Richard Fausset As Georgia election officials work to complete a recount of nearly five million ballots by Wednesday, President Trump is trying to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the process — a hand recount that his own campaign demanded. In a series of tweets in recent days, Mr. Trump has alleged that vote counters have not been permitted to match signatures included with absentee ballots and has falsely claimed that this renders the recount meaningless. He has also claimed incorrectly that the inability to match the signatures is the result of a consent decree signed by the state. Here are the facts: In Georgia, where the initial count showed that Mr. Trump lost to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. by several thousand votes, the recount process does not include the reverification of signatures included with absentee ballots. When absentee ballots are received by Georgia’s election officials, the signature on the envelope is matched to other signatures that are part of the voter’s record. Once that is verified, the envelope containing the signature is separated from the ballot to protect the secrecy of the voter’s choice. Voters whose signatures do not match those on record are notified and asked for clarification. The envelopes and ballots are retained for two years. But because they have been separated to protect voters’ privacy, there is no longer a way to match ballots to envelopes. As such, rechecking signatures in a recount would be meaningless. A similar procedure is followed in other states, and Georgia’s process of separating ballots from signature envelopes has nothing to do with any consent decree. Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has said that the state trained election officials on signature matching. More than 1.3 million people voted by absentee ballot in Georgia in the general election. Mr. Raffensperger also has accused fellow Republicans of trying to undermine the legitimacy of the state’s election in an effort to swing the results to Mr. Trump. In an interview with The Washington Post on Monday, Mr. Raffensperger said that Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina had asked him about possible ways that ballots could be disqualified, including whether the secretary of state could reject all absentee ballots in counties that had a high number of signature mismatches. Mr. Graham, speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill on Monday, denied that he had suggested to Mr. Raffensperger that he find a way to throw out legally cast ballots. He said that his conversation with the secretary of state covered questions about Georgia’s system of verifying signatures with absentee ballots. Election officials in Georgia also announced Monday evening that they had discovered 2,600 ballots in Floyd County that had not been previously reported to the state, an error they attributed to “gross incompetence” on the part of the county’s elections director. The newly discovered ballots will reduce Mr. Biden’s margin by a few hundred votes, they said — not enough to put his victory in jeopardy. By Mike Isaac and Kate Conger Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Jack Dorsey of Twitter are testifying on Tuesday about their platforms, misinformation and the 2020 election. Mr. Zuckerberg said that while many people on the social network disliked the presence of misinformation, he also strongly believed that Facebook should not be the arbiter of what content is or isn’t true. Mr. Dorsey said he wanted to give users more control over the algorithms that moderate content on Twitter. Follow along with us live here. By Dan Bilefsky A prominent electoral map on the website of Everylegalvote.com, a self-described fraud-buster, conveyed an alternate reality on Monday. Despite the latest election results showing Joseph R. Biden Jr. winning a decisive 306 votes in the Electoral College compared with 232 for President Trump, the site’s map showed Mr. Trump as the winner of the election. Mr. Trump had received 232 votes compared with 214 for Mr. Biden, according to the site’s map, which was flecked with orange to connote states where it claimed that voter fraud had been detected. Click on a tab saying “without voter fraud,” and Mr. Trump’s vote suddenly leapt to 318 against Mr. Biden’s 220. As President Trump refuses to concede the election, a lot of internet traffic is being directed to this slickly produced website channeling the president’s mix of falsehoods, conspiracy theories and baseless accusations of voter fraud. The website has promoted the false narrative that mail-in ballots were used to steal the election from Mr. Trump. It has posited that thousands of dead people voted in Michigan when they did not. It has also posted content from a source with links to QAnon, the elaborate conspiracy movement that falsely claims the existence of a Satan-worshipping pedophile cabal run by senior Democrats, who are plotting against Mr. Trump. QAnon believers had predicted that Mr. Trump would easily win the election. “They are attempting to install Joe Biden as president without due process of law and order,” the site says, citing the media, “certain elected officials” and people in positions of power, both in the United States and in other countries. A review of Everylegalvote.com shows an attempt to delegitimize the election under a veneer of empiricism by drawing on murky and debunked theories. The site did not respond to a request for comment. Everylegalvote.com lists its sponsors and financial backers as a coalition of right-wing groups including Allied Security Operations Group, the Economic War Room, and Liberty Center for God and Country. An office manager at Allied Security Operations Group, who declined to give her name, said by phone that the group was a private Dallas-based cybersecurity firm. She said the issue of voter fraud was an area of specialty of the company’s chief financial officer, Russell Ramsland, a businessman who ran for Congress in Texas as a Republican in 2016 and was defeated in the primary. According to Mr. Ramsland’s LinkedIn profile, he has an M.B.A. from Harvard. The Economic War Room listed on Everylegalvote.com’s website appears to refer to the “Economic War Room With Kevin Freeman,” a weekly television financial news show. Mr. Freeman was not immediately available for comment. Mr. Freeman is described on Economic War Room’s website as “one of the world’s leading experts on the issues of economic warfare and financial terrorism.” He is also listed as a senior fellow at the Center for Security Policy, a Washington-based think tank that has been designated as a hate group with anti-Muslim ideology by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Last year, Mar-a-Lago, President Trump’s private club in Palm Beach, Fla., came under criticism after agreeing to host an event by the group. In a broadcast in the days after the election, which was posted on Economic War Room’s website, Mr. Freeman called the election “one of the most contested elections in history.” “The left is out for blood and total victory,” he said. He predicted a violent insurrection by the “far left” and said it wanted to tear down God and family and install a nanny state. As evidence, he cited attempts in states like California to curtail family gatherings during Thanksgiving and make people wear masks in between bites of turkey. Liberty Center for God and Country, the site’s other backer, said it aimed to “promote and protect our God-given, unalienable Constitutional rights and liberties” and to “support legal efforts that protect these liberties.” It recently posted on its website a request by President Trump for every registered voter to send him a handwritten letter, demanding “a full election audit of all 50 states.” The group was not immediately available for comment. Everylegalvote.com has not shied away from promoting misinformation from dubious sources. After President Trump made baseless claims that Dominion Voting Systems, which makes software that local governments use to help run their elections, had software glitches that changed voting tallies in key states, the site posted a Twitter thread on the software maker by Ron Watkins, who has been part of QAnon’s inner circle. In his thread, Mr. Watkins posited that local information technology “guys” could have hacked into the system to alter election results. A group of federal, state and local election officials have said “there is no evidence” any voting systems were compromised. By Linda Qiu President Trump has posted over 300 tweets attacking the integrity of the 2020 election since election night, unleashing a cascade of false and misleading claims. Here’s a review. Just hours after polls closed on Nov. 3, Mr. Trump began sowing mistrust in the vote counting process, as he tweeted ominously about “surprise ballot dumps,” “finding Biden votes” and “miraculously” disappearing leads. What he was describing was simply vote counting. Election officials warned for months that counting ballots might take days or even weeks to complete, given the prevalence of absentee ballots this year. Studies and experts predicted that Mr. Trump could lead on election night in key states, but that lead could be slowly eroded as officials continued to count mail-in ballots. The president has objected to counting votes past Election Day, claiming at least twice that late-arriving ballots are “illegal.” But 23 states and Washington, D.C., accept mail-in ballots after Election Day if they are postmarked by a certain day. Mr. Trump has repeatedly and falsely claimed to have “won” the election or predicted that he will win after recounts in Georgia and Arizona and lawsuit verdicts. In reality, he has virtually no chance of winning, given the large margins held by President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. in those states. Mr. Biden leads by 14,000 votes in Georgia and about 10,000 votes in Arizona — far more than even the largest margin to be recently overturned, several hundred votes in a 2008 Senate election in Minnesota. Conversely, Mr. Trump has objected to news outlets and others declaring Mr. Biden the victor, asking, “Since when does the Lamestream Media call who our next president will be?” A media call is not the same thing as certified results or the final Electoral College vote, but it’s worth noting that The Associated Press has called presidential elections since 1848, by combining reported vote tallies and “research including demographic data, voting history and statistics about advance voting.” About two dozen of Mr. Trump’s tweets included broad allegations of “widespread voter fraud,” “illegal votes” and “a stolen election.” Election officials across the country told The New York Times that there was no evidence that irregularities affected the outcome of the election. In a few instances, the president gave specific examples of what he suggested amounted to fraud, but those claims lacked context, were disputed or were flat-out wrong. He claimed that military ballots in Georgia were “missing.” They were not, according to election officials in the state. He posted a video of election officials gathering ballots and asked “is this what our Country has come to?” But the footage simply showed officials abiding by the legal process: collecting ballots from a drop box that had been locked by 8 p.m. on Election Day. He has cited Richard Hopkins, a Postal Service worker in Erie, Pa., who claimed that ballots were backdated. But the postmaster of the facility denied that this happened, and the Postal Service’s inspector general told Congress that Mr. Hopkins disavowed his claims. This weekend, he tweeted, “10,000 dead people voted in Michigan,” alleging a rigged election — though the claim had been debunked by Michigan officials and news outlets days earlier. In over a dozen tweets, Mr. Trump has complained about poll observers being denied access to watch ballot counting. But that’s not true, according to his own legal filings. A lawyer for Mr. Trump admitted that there were “a nonzero number” of campaign observers allowed in the counting room in Philadelphia. At least four times, the president has falsely claimed that Georgia was prohibited from verifying signatures by a consent decree. Under a March settlement, officials must notify voters whose signatures were rejected within three business days and give them the chance to correct issues. It did not bar officials from verifying signatures. Georgia’s secretary of state, a Republican, noted that the state trained election officials on signature matching, required a confirmed match and created a portal that checked and confirmed voters’ drivers licenses. (Signatures are not verified again during the recount process, as ballots are separated from the signed envelopes during the initial counting process.) Dominion Voting Systems has become a particular target of presidential ire. False conspiracy theories that the “glitches” in the company’s software changed vote tallies have flourished on social media. But Mr. Trump has escalated those inaccurate claims into baseless allegations that Dominion purposefully “rigged” the election and is a “Radical Left” company. He also tweeted a seven-second video in which a Dominion executive, John Poulos, says, “Components in our products that come from China.” The company, on a website debunking rumors, says that it “works with all political parties; our customer base and our government outreach practices reflect this nonpartisan approach.” Dominion operates in 28 states, including Republican strongholds such as Utah, Kansas and Tennessee as well as battleground states that Mr. Trump won, including Florida and Ohio. The seven-second clip was taken from a January congressional hearing about election security. Mr. Poulos also said that “our tabulated products have always been manufactured in the United States.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
