In the 1970s, Anya Phillips left Taiwan to forge a fashion career in New York City, showing up in a burgeoning downtown punk scene in what would become her signature dress, an eye-catching piece made of electric blue spandex that laced up the front. When she paired it with stilettos and a full-length fur coat, she exuded a slinky glamour that would make her the “It girl” of Lower Manhattan’s night clubs. New York at the time was on the brink of bankruptcy, overwhelmed with neglect and crime. But rent was cheap and amid the decay, designers, artists, musicians and filmmakers formed collaborations, making art and meeting up at rock venues. “Arriving there and finding this incredible creativity happening in this kind of grimy downtown scene — she instantly got it,” said Sylvia Reed, a close friend and the former wife and manager of the Velvet Underground’s Lou Reed, in a phone interview. Phillips mingled with artists like the Ramones and Iggy Pop and styled musicians in garments that suited their sensibilities and colored their rock personas. She designed the pink dress that the singer Debbie Harry wore on the cover of Blondie’s “Plastic Letters” (1978) and dressed James Chance and the Contortions in 1950s-era suits and ties that helped define the aesthetic of no wave, a nihilistic subgenre of punk rock. Phillips’s plans were always bigger than the punk scene. She talked with Reed about wanting to translate her designs into her own fashion label, but expressed concerns that conventional avenues to fame might be challenging for her, particularly as an Asian immigrant. Before she could realize her ambitions, Phillips died of cancer on June 19, 1981. She was 26. “She was always up to something, designing clothes, drawing sketches,” said James Chance in an interview with the website Vacant. “I really think if she was still alive, she would have become a designer. Many other people have been using her ideas.”
