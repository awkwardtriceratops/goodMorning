Isvett welcomes Chuck Rocha, a senior campaign adviser to Bernie Sanders, and Linda Chavez, director of the Becoming American Institute and a senior fellow at the Niskanen Center. Together, they debunk the myth of a monolithic “Latino voting bloc,” explain Latino support for President Trump and discuss the role of Latinos in the future of both parties. Linda describes going from being one of the highest-ranking women in the Reagan White House to not recognizing her party in the Trump era. And Chuck explains how Sanders was able to excite Latino voters like no other candidate. Background Reading: Isvett on Walter Mercado’s optimism, and a Cuban expat’s reaction to the death of Fidel Castro Chuck on the work of people of color on political campaigns and why Latinos are Joe Biden’s secret untapped weapon Linda’s analysis of the Republican convention, on immigration reform for the Republican Party and on the American dreams of Latino Americans How to listen to “The Argument”: Press play or read the transcript (found by midday Thursday above the center teal eye) at the top of this page, or tune in on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, Stitcher or your preferred podcast listening app. Tell us what you think at argument@nytimes.com. “The Argument” is a production of The New York Times Opinion section.
