In this special feature, Times Opinion writers pick the winner and then rank the victory on a scale of 1 to 10: 1 means a very narrow win; 10 means a blowout. Here’s what our columnists and contributors thought of the debate. Jamelle Bouie To some degree Biden’s win is automatic because he didn’t fail or slip up. In the absence of anything that could move the race in a major way, Biden — who leads by an average of around eight points — is the winner. But Biden’s win is also a function of a solid performance focused on real issues, in contrast with the president’s decision to spend most of the debate on the deep lore of the Fox Cinematic Universe. Elizabeth Bruenig A tie. Supposing we ever return to some kind of civic equilibrium, this debate should be used to teach school children about legitimation (the act of providing legitimacy) crises. Neither Biden nor Trump spent much time asserting the good of their respective philosophies, because persuasion isn’t really on the table. Instead, they disputed assertions of fact. Since the right and left no longer agree on what institutions or figures should be seen as authorities on any given issue, there’s no debate there, just an aggressive presentation of two different worlds. Christopher Buskirk Trump won this debate hands down and he did it by upsetting expectations. In the last debate, Trump was criticized for being too aggressive. Biden gave a solid, if uninspiring performance and didn’t make a gaffe or look old or tired as his supporters feared. This time it was Trump’s turn to do the unexpected, which meant showing a much tamer, more reasonable side of himself while remaining firm and focused on his message. Linda Chavez A draw — neither candidate lost points; Trump may have stopped the hemorrhaging. Trump was more disciplined than in the previous debate and managed not to dig himself into a deeper hole over his handling of the pandemic. Biden was at his best when he got emotional over the 545 children separated from their parents at the border that remain in U.S. custody, because the Trump administration has lost track of their parents. Gail Collins Biden won. He was strong when he spoke directly to the audience. Trump was terrible when he talked about race. How many times has he said he’s been the best president for Black Americans since Abraham Lincoln? That was always a stunner, but he topped it when he announced that he was the “least racist person in the room.” Matthew Continetti President Trump entered the debate with his campaign on the ropes. A poor performance would have ended any chance for a comeback. But Trump’s performance was not poor. He refrained from interrupting, contrasted his policies with Joe Biden’s proposals and defined Biden as a career politician whose almost half-century in public life has produced few tangible accomplishments. Trump didn’t convince Democratic voters or independents. But his campaign believes that a come-from-behind Electoral College victory rests not on persuading voters but on turning out wavering Republicans and low-propensity white voters without college degrees. This debate gave Trump and his team reason to hope that, despite everything, lightning might strike twice. Michelle Cottle Biden won. For Trump to win, he needed a breakout moment, preferably one knocking Biden off balance. He failed — even when he dug in on the topic of Hunter Biden and started slinging mud at the extended Biden clan. The basic trajectory of the race remains the same, which is not good for the president. Ross Douthat Call it Biden by a hair. The threat of the mute button made Trump seem measured, Biden was sharper than last time overall but faded more at the end, and they seemed about equal in their lies and flubs. Trump is too deep in very-online right-wing narratives and doesn’t have a good answer on health care; Biden falls back to the emptier sort of liberal talking points when he gets pressed on policy. By merely being cogent Trump probably shored up his eroding base; by merely sounding like the kind of normal politician Trump kept attacking him for being, Biden probably kept his lead, and that’s what counts. Michelle Goldberg Joe Biden won. Trump’s willingness to lie shamelessly and prodigiously is a serious advantage, and in the first part of the debate he got away with baselessly accusing Biden of corruption. But Biden, crisper than usual, was able to position himself as the economic populist in the race, speaking urgently about the need to bail out small businesses and getting Trump to come out against both the Affordable Care Act and a higher minimum wage. Nicholas Kristof Biden won, because Trump needed to change the dynamic and instead reinforced it. Trump again seemed to lack all empathy, to have no strategy for Covid-19, to be indifferent to suffering at the border, to be in over his head, to have no answers for Americans struggling from a pandemic of both disease and unemployment. Yes, Trump improved his behavior, but he didn’t show any sign that he has a realistic plan to deal with America’s problems. Matt Labash Biden. This debate, unlike the last, was long on substance and specifics, short — or shorter — on interruptions and shots to the gooloos. Even Donald Trump only mocked Biden’s family 10 or 12 times, a new personal best, self-restraint-wise. In a word, boring. There was no joy or transcendence, no real kill shots or knockout punches. The needle didn’t move. But because the only laugh-out-loud lines were Trump’s, for all the wrong reasons (on Covid: “We’re rounding the turn … it’s going away”), slight advantage, Biden. Liz Mair Trump. The debate rules worked in his favor, he was more disciplined, and even though he lied through his teeth for much of the debate, he did it and often does it in a way that is convincing for anyone who doesn’t believe he is always lying. For better or for worse, that remains a decent chunk of the electorate. Daniel McCarthy President Trump won because he was back in top form, the Trump of 2016: bold and combative. But he also took a page from Mike Pence’s playbook in the vice-presidential debate about the effectiveness of blending firmness with politeness. He put Biden on the defensive. Melanye Price Biden narrowly won because he seems sincere and competent. Bret Stephens Donald Trump was less appalling than usual, probably thanks to the mute function on his microphone. But Biden had the better part of the night, for two reasons: He was mentally sharp and ideologically non-scary. Héctor Tobar Biden won. For all Trump’s bullying of the moderator, and his insults and false attacks, he did not make a case for his re-election. Even a slightly more respectful Trump — tamed by the threat of a muted microphone — was exhausting to watch. He’s still running as a character in a reality show, but this time during an existential crisis of public health and the economy. Charlie Warzel It is legitimately difficult for me to imagine the undecided voter who would learn much from this evening. Both candidates were better than the last run, but this election is ultimately a referendum on Donald Trump, which means he needed a decisive victory for people outside the base. Biden won. Peter Wehner Biden won because for the first hour he did better than he did at any previous debate, either presidential or in the primaries. He was energetic, strong, showed empathy and was in command. He prosecuted his case effectively and got in some excellent lines. Biden stumbled during the last part, but he didn’t lose ground, and may have marginally gained ground, in a race he’s winning. Will Wilkinson Biden won. Character is on the ballot, Biden said, repeating a theme of his campaign. He’s right, and the contrast was evident all night. When Trump again scurrilously smeared Biden’s son, Biden honorably refused to take a shot at Trump’s kids. It can be tempting to think he missed a ripe opportunity to hit back, but the basic decency of Biden’s restraint did not go unnoticed and made the case for his candidacy in a way that Trump is completely helpless to rebut. Jamelle Bouie Voters care about nothing more than Covid, and the Covid moment at the beginning was the most important one. Biden could speak to the challenge of the pandemic, while Trump dismissed it. Once that happened, the debate was functionally over. Elizabeth Bruenig When Biden decided to bring up the allegations swirling around his son Hunter before the moderator could touch the subject, it seemed to jolt Trump out of his practiced irenity. From there on, the real Trump emerged, tossing out catty barbs and bitchy insults. (The cut-mic rule seemed to effectively discourage him from interruption sprees, probably because he knows mouthing ripostes silently looks impotent.) Christopher Buskirk Early in the debate I thought the pivotal moment for Biden was when he refused to deny unequivocally the legitimacy of Hunter’s emails and texts, saying only that nothing unethical or illegal was done. Though that may come back to haunt him, it was late in the debate when he said he would legalize millions of people in the country illegally and that he would put the oil industry out of business over time, which seems more likely to cause serious electoral damage in places like Arizona and Pennsylvania. Linda Chavez The debate’s new microphone-muting policy saved Trump from himself. Gail Collins Trump on children being separated from their parents at the border was just chillingly cold. And, on the same subject, announcing that the people who come back for their court hearings had “the lowest IQ.” Matthew Continetti The contrast on the coronavirus was stark. Trump said he was for resuming in-person schooling and opening the economy as much as possible, while Biden left open the possibility of future lockdowns. The many parents who have grown frustrated with remote schooling may be receptive to Trump’s approach. Michelle Cottle Repeatedly, Biden stressed that he doesn’t look at challenges and policies in terms of red states and blue states. He promised to be the president of all Americans and to make sure that even those who don’t vote for him feel represented. This message has been central to Biden’s campaign and his brand. It will sound hokey to many political obsessives, but it is a compelling one for a nation exhausted by the past three years of division, rage and chaos. Ross Douthat Biden managed to somewhat pre-empt Trump’s attacks on his son’s alleged buckraking by bringing up the president’s taxes, which bogged Trump down in a long self-justifying ramble. If this was the president going for the jugular, his thrust was too easily blunted to define the night or change the race. Michelle Goldberg Mocking Biden’s concern for struggling families sitting around their kitchen table, Trump tried to position himself as being above political clichés, but he just came off like a callous schmuck. Nicholas Kristof Whenever Covid-19 comes up, Trump inevitably flounders. He blames China, he says that even more people would have died without him, he says that Democrats are blocking an economic stimulus package, he blames Dr. Anthony Fauci — but none of it is credible. When the United States has 4 percent of the world’s population and roughly 20 percent of the world’s Covid-19 deaths, there is just nothing Trump can say. He had no defense for his failure to respond adequately to Covid-19. Matt Labash I would rather eat a live puppy with baby-seal sprinkles than moderate one of these things. It’s that thankless a task. And NBC’s Kristen Welker generally did a bang-up job. But when Trump asked Biden “what’s that all about?” on the most pressing news item of the night — Biden being implicated by his son’s former business partner as potentially profiteering on a China contract — she rescued Biden by cutting Trump off. Why? Let ‘em scrap. Liz Mair It’s possible that Trump’s assaults on Biden as “bought and paid for” by foreign governments, companies and people will prove more effective than detractors expect because normal people don’t have time to read news stories debunking these kinds of claims, and they generally believe all politicians are crooks who are lining their pockets whenever they can. Daniel McCarthy Trump was effective in calling attention to two Biden weaknesses: members of his party are more favorable to socialized medicine than Biden is, setting up a conflict — or betrayal — if he becomes president, and the failure of Biden to deliver on his current promises when he was part of the Obama administration, and in his nearly five decades in government. Melanye Price Best moment was when Biden called Trump Abraham Lincoln. The humor of it only highlighted how ridiculous Trump was for making the comparison. Bret Stephens Did I catch Biden saying, in an echo of Reagan in his debate with Jimmy Carter, “There you go again”? As Borat might say: “It’s a very nice!” Héctor Tobar Trump succeeded in taking over big sections of the debate. But Biden fought back with moments of pointed anger. When Trump went after “blue state” governors over Covid, Biden said he’d be president for all Americans. Biden rightly called the separation of immigrant children a national disgrace — and looked truly outraged as he did so. Charlie Warzel The president’s response to reports that his administration cannot find the parents of 500-plus children separated at the border was that the facilities are very clean and the children are “so well taken care of.” There were plenty of low points this evening, but this one stood out. Peter Wehner Biden spoke with authentic passion about Trump’s policy of separating children from their parents. Trump not only showed no remorse; he argued that those kids were being “so well taken care of.” Biden showed compassion toward parentless children while Trump showed callousness. So it turned out to be more than a moment in a debate; it was a window into the soul of both men. Will Wilkinson Shortly after raising false hope that a Covid-19 vaccine will soon be available, Trump backpedaled. “I didn’t say over soon,” the president said, adding that “we’re learning to live with it.” Learning to live with it? Biden retorted, people are “learning to die with it.” Biden effectively blamed America’s atrocious death toll on Trump’s vain ineptitude and made a strong case that he’d do better. By itself, that’s enough to win the debate and, probably, the election. Jamelle Bouie President Trump has said many monstrous things during his time in office, but responding to a question on separated children with a brag about the conditions in which they suffer (“They are so well-taken care of”) is grotesque. Elizabeth Bruenig When Biden, exasperated with Trump’s attacks on the specter of universal health care, declared “he is running against someone else,” he was right. The suggestion that Biden is a far-left radical is transparently absurd; as Biden pointed out, he ran to beat the left, and he won. People who need more than modest, smartly negotiated incremental help will have to wait a little longer. Christopher Buskirk During the discussion of Covid-19 early in the debate, Biden described the pillars of his plan as including the deployment of rapid testing and keeping customers at restaurants socially distanced, including the use of plexiglass between tables. Both measures have been widely implemented for months. Here in Arizona, where I live, rapid tests are plentiful and my friends and family have gotten results in less than hour. Likewise restaurants have been open using the protocols he described. This suggests that he’s unaware of how many states have successfully implemented such plans. Linda Chavez When Biden looked at his watch to check how much time remained in the debate, it was reminiscent of a moment in the 1992 town hall debate when George H.W. Bush also checked his watch. Biden appeared to be gauging how much time he had left to close the sale. Unlike Bush, he delivered when in his closing statement he promised to be a president for all Americans. Gail Collins OK, not a good moment when Biden checked his watch. Matthew Continetti Biden didn’t deny his goal of “transitioning” from the oil industry. That admission is guaranteed to show up in attack ads soon. Michelle Cottle In response to Biden’s outrage over this administration’s inhumane policy of separating migrant children from their families at the border, Trump probably should have skipped bragging about cleanliness of the facilities where the kids were held and how perfectly they were treated. He could also have skipped the part where he snarked that the only migrants who bother to show up for their court dates under the “catch and release” system are those with “the lowest IQ.” Ross Douthat Biden really, really doesn’t want to admit his son did anything wrong with his alleged influence-peddling, to the point of denying that he or anyone else made money in China. The election isn’t likely to turn on that point, but it does seem like a lie. Michelle Goldberg Kristen Welker asked about people, especially people of color, who live near oil refineries and chemical plants that are making them sick. Trump had no idea what she was talking about. Biden gave a detailed and humane answer about “fence-line communities,” suggesting real familiarity with the language of environmental justice. Nicholas Kristof When the issue of the U.S. government separating migrant children from parents and then being unable to locate some children’s parents came up, any normal person would feel compassion. But Trump showed not a hint of empathy and simply lashed out at smugglers, at Biden, at everyone. He cemented the unappealing sense that he has the capacity to feel compassion only for himself. Matt Labash Trump was allegedly cleared as being COVID-negative by his doctor. Which doctor, we can’t say. (Dr. Sebastian Gorka?) But Biden might have made a huge boo-boo tonight by letting the debate commission remove the plexiglass partition. He is, by all accounts, sitting on a big, fat polling lead, even in swing states that Trump won in 2016. And now that even Texas is reportedly tied up, Trump’s best bet might have been to hock a Covid loogie on Biden, infect him with viral load, and let the fates take their course before Election Day. Take extra zinc, Uncle Joe. Liz Mair Biden seemed to redefine his own health care plan to mean automatic Medicaid enrollment in certain states and not a true “public option,” which a Senate packed with a fresh block of moderate Democrats would never pass given the price tag and cost problems in states like Washington anyway. Daniel McCarthy Something big but revealing is the overemphasis on Covid-19 during these debates — no president can deliver a miracle cure, and no plan amounts to more than waiting for a vaccine. Topics where a president can do more were shortchanged for an emotional media narrative. The virus is a big concern, but that doesn’t mean there’s a political answer. Melanye Price A little noticed but important moment was when Biden seemingly broke with Barack Obama on immigration. It may be his Sister Souljah moment, an appeal to Latinos by criticizing Obama’s deportation policies. Bret Stephens The moment Biden slyly made fun of Trump by calling him “Lincoln.” He punctured the president’s pomposity like a needle popping a helium balloon. Héctor Tobar In the section about racial justice, Trump repeated his risible claim that he has done more for the African-American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln. Silly, ridiculous — and perhaps a fittingly stupid end to his political career. Charlie Warzel The moment I was watching for was how Trump would spin the Rudy Giuliani-led allegations about Hunter Biden’s laptop and emails. But the president’s attacks were nearly incoherent. I have closely followed the saga playing out online, and I barely understood the references. I think it’s an example that the Trump campaign is so deep in its own information universe that they don’t realize it’s actually quite hard for outsiders to follow. Peter Wehner Trump started out showing discipline and seemed nearly normal, but once again he showed he’s psychologically unable to stay there. About 25 minutes into the debate, the limbic system started to take charge. He was overwhelmed by his bottomless well of grievances and self-pity. Oh, and the greatest energy Trump demonstrated wasn’t on the pandemic, health care, racial injustice or the climate; it was on Hunter Biden laptop. QAnon and OANN world were pleased; the rest of America, not so much. Will Wilkinson Trump claiming that “I am the least racist person in this room” and then arguing that asylum seekers who show up for their hearings have “the lowest IQ” perfectly encapsulates the man’s signature combination of mendacity, bigotry and gall.
