She was 26. “She taught me stuff my own people, my own siblings, my own mother didn’t teach me,” Preonia Flakes, Ms. Taylor’s cousin, told Rukmini and Yoruba. Kenneth Walker, Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend, said: “She was just so kind and loving and caring.” The first of her family to graduate from high school, with an interest in medicine and health care, she emerged from the discussions as someone who, despite being dealt a tough hand in life, was determined to push beyond the limitations of her circumstance. At the beginning of 2020, Ms. Taylor posted on social media that it was going to be her year. After an apparent low point, her life was changing: She was planning a family with Mr. Walker, she had a new job and a new car. She had also blocked Jamarcus Glover, a convicted drug dealer with whom she had been romantically involved on and off since 2016, from her phone. But forces were already in motion. The Louisville Police Department was preparing raids on locations it had linked to Mr. Glover — and Ms. Taylor’s address was on the target list. Today, in the first of two parts, we explore Ms. Taylor’s life and how law enforcement ended up at her door. On today’s episode: Rukmini Callimachi, a correspondent for The Times, and Yoruba Richen, a filmmaker, talk to Ms. Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer; her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker; and her cousin, Preonia Flakes. Background reading: The story of what happened the night Breonna Taylor was killed remains largely untold. A Times Investigation explores the path to the shooting, and its consequences.
