Test<br></h1><p id="artcont">The Mets’ second baseman will miss the entire 2021 season after a positive test for a synthetic steroid — his second doping violation. By Benjamin Hoffman Robinson Cano, a veteran second baseman for the Mets, will miss the entire 2021 season after receiving a 162-game suspension for his second violation of Major League Baseball’s drug prevention and treatment program. Cano, an eight-time All-Star who had shown some decline in recent years, had something of a resurgence this year in baseball’s pandemic-shortened, 60-game season. That resurgence will now be scrutinized following the announcement of the suspension, in which the commissioner’s office said Cano had tested positive for Stanozolol, a synthetic steroid. “We were extremely disappointed to be informed about Robinson’s suspension for violating Major League Baseball’s Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program,” Sandy Alderson, the president of the Mets, said in a statement. “The violation is very unfortunate for him, the organization, our fans, and the sport. The Mets fully support M.L.B.’s efforts toward eliminating performance enhancing substances from the game.” In 2018 while he was a member of the Seattle Mariners, Cano received an 80-game suspension after testing positive for furosemide, a diuretic better known as Lasix, which is frequently used as a masking agent for performance-enhancing drugs. Under the terms of the league’s testing program, a second positive test carries a mandatory 162-game suspension. Cano turned 38 last month and is coming off a season in which he hit .316 with 10 home runs in 49 games. He is three seasons removed from his last All-Star game and while he will be suspended without pay for the 2021 season, he will still have two years remaining on the 10-year, $240 million contract he originally signed with Seattle before the 2014 season. He will be 39 and 40 in those seasons. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
