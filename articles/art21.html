By Eliza Shapiro, Dana Rubinstein and Emma G. Fitzsimmons New York City is delaying the start of its school year by 10 days, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Tuesday, as part of a deal to avert a teachers’ strike and calm principals and parents anxious about the start of in-person classes. The city’s 1.1 million public schoolchildren will not have any in-person or remote classes until Sept. 21. The deal, which was hammered out during an overnight bargaining session between City Hall and the unions representing the city’s teachers and principals, is intended to give educators more time to prepare for the most closely watched reopening effort in the country. It is also meant to give the mayor a longer runway to pull off one of the most ambitious, and riskiest, city initiatives in decades. The mayor announced the new date about a week before the scheduled first day of school, leaving working families little time to rearrange their schedules. The announcement followed weeks of escalating pressure from union leaders, elected officials, teachers and principals who said they would not be ready to reopen as planned on Sept. 10. The city’s powerful teachers’ union was poised this week to authorize an illegal strike for its 75,000 members. Fulfilling a major union demand, Mr. de Blasio said the city would require random testing every month in all city schools starting in October. Teachers will report to their schools as scheduled next week, and will spend the next few weeks physically preparing classrooms for children, ensuring that their children have devices for remote learning, and meeting their students virtually.
