The evening’s speakers will also include Kellyanne Conway, who is leaving the White House. Her legacy will include coining the phrase “alternative facts” two days after Mr. Trump took office to describe the administration’s spin. A team of New York Times reporters are following all the developments and fact-checking the speakers, providing context and explanation.   By Jeanna Smialek — Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law It is true that women’s unemployment hit the lowest level since roughly World World II before the pandemic, and it is also true that women took more than 70 percent of jobs added to the economy last year. But it is not clear how Ms. Trump is coming up with the 4.3 million new jobs for women — Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that between February 2017 and February 2020, women gained 3.5 million jobs. Even counting from the election, it’s only 3.7 million. Thanks to the pandemic, those gains have been erased, and women are now employed at 2013 levels. By Linda Qiu — Vice President Mike Pence The Veterans Choice Program was created in 2014 after the scandal of hidden waiting lists at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. Under the program, veterans who do not live within 40 miles of a department hospital or face wait times of more than 30 days for care could seek private health care funded by the government. In 2018, Mr. Trump signed a law that overhauled and consolidated Veterans Choice and other existing programs into a single Veterans Community Care Program. Under new rules, veterans who must drive for at least 30 minutes to one of the department’s facilities will be able to opt for private care, a less stringent requirement for many veterans. By Lara Jakes — Richard Grenell, former acting director of national intelligence The day that an accord went into effect in 2016 to limit Iran’s nuclear program, as brokered by the United States and other world powers, the Obama administration loaded a plane with $400 million in several currencies as a first installment of money long owed to Tehran. The money was part of $1.7 billion in assets, including interest, that the United States froze after Iran’s revolution in 1979 and that had been intended to pay for military hardware that the former shah in Tehran had purchased but that was never delivered. By Edward Wong — Richard Grenell, the former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell is trying to assert that President Trump always shows support for protests against authoritarian governments. Mr. Trump, who often praises dictators, has failed to express support for some of the most prominent such protests of the last three years. The most notable example is that of the pro-democracy protests that began in June 2019 in Hong Kong. Mr. Trump told Xi Jinping, the leader of China, on a telephone call that June that he and his aides would refrain from commenting on the protests if the Chinese government agreed to continue with trade talks, according to administration officials. John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, wrote in his new book that he heard Mr. Trump say of the Hong Kong protests that month: “I don’t want to get involved,” and, “We have human-rights problems too.” Mr. Bolton also wrote that Mr. Trump refused to issue a White House statement on the 30th anniversary of the Chinese military’s massacre of pro-democracy protesters around Tiananmen Square. “Who cares about it?” Mr. Trump said. “I’m trying to make a deal.” Mr. Trump has made a few comments on the protests in Belarus, where demonstrators say Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, the authoritarian leader, subverted a presidential election this month. But Mr. Trump did express support on Twitter in January for anti-government protests in Iran. The message appeared on his account in English and Farsi. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg — Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law While some progressive Democrats do want to “defund the police,” Mr. Biden is not among them. Since the police killing of George Floyd on Memorial Day, Mr. Biden has made calls for systemic changes to the country’s criminal justice system and proposed changes to police tactics. But he has said he opposes cutting resources for law enforcement — rather, he has proposed new funding for community policing, which a spokesman said would be conditioned on departments implementing reforms. He reinforced this sentiment on the opening night of the Democratic National Convention, taking pains to set himself apart from the left wing of his party. “Most cops are good,” Mr. Biden said then, “but the fact is, the bad ones need to be identified and prosecuted.” By Charlie Savage — Richard Grenell, former acting director of national intelligence Mr. Trump and his supporters — like Mr. Grenell, who Mr. Trump installed as the nation’s top intelligence official from February to May without Senate confirmation to be in that role — have sought to portray him as a victim of the counterintelligence investigation the F.B.I. opened in July 2016 into Russia’s covert operation to tilt the election in his favor. The investigation included an attempt to figure out whether anyone associated with the Trump campaign cooperated with that effort, wittingly or otherwise. In the course of that inquiry, the F.B.I. used several confidential human informants to approach Trump campaign associates to see what they would say about any advance knowledge of Russia’s hacking and release of Democratic emails. It also wiretapped Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser with many ties to Russian intelligence officials; by the time the F.B.I. applied for that warrant, the election was nearly over and Mr. Page had already left the Trump campaign, although wiretap orders permit the F.B.I. to look at any older emails in a target’s account. The purpose of this investigation was to understand the scope and nature of an effort by a foreign adversary to manipulate an American election. Calling it a “surveillance operation on the Trump campaign” connotes trying to gain an electoral advantage, but there is no evidence that any information gathered by the inquiry was provided to the Clinton campaign or leaked to affect the vote. Moreover, saying it was launched by the Obama-Biden administration suggests political appointees launched it, but the investigation was opened by career law enforcement officials and continued under the Trump administration. By Linda Qiu — Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law Lincoln did not famously say that. He didn’t say it at all. Fact checkers at PolitiFact and Snopes have noted that the quote comes from a viral image that circulated on Facebook. Here’s what Lincoln actually said, according to historians: “At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.” By Ana Swanson — Richard Grenell, former acting director of national intelligence. A bipartisan consensus has emerged in Washington that China poses a significant security and technological threat. And the Trump administration was able to garner bipartisan support for the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, a trade deal that replaced and updated the North American Free Trade Agreement. After undergoing some significant revisions by Democrats, the trade deal was approved in the Democratic-led House in December by a vote of 385 to 41. But Democrats would likely argue with the idea that Mr. Trump “led” them to these viewpoints. Some congressional Democrats, like Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have long been vocal critics of China. And some of Mr. Trump’s populist views on trade are more similar to ideas long held by labor unions and Democrats than the Republican Party. By Jonathan Weisman — Madison Cawthorn, Republican House candidate. Actually, James Madison did not sign the Declaration of Independence, nor did George Washington, John Jay, or Alexander Hamilton. By Katherine J. Wu — Representative Lee Zeldin of New York Testing for the coronavirus in the United States has been widely disparaged by experts across fields as inconsistent, insufficient and in some ways disastrous — sentiments that Mr. Zeldin’s comments don’t reflect. Turnaround times for results continue to stretch past a week in many parts of the country; supply shortages have hamstrung laboratories trying to process thousands of patient samples each day. Many diagnostic tests for the coronavirus are now approved for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration. But many of the companies that manufacture them are limited by production lines that were built for much more modest demand, and are struggling to ramp up. What’s more, guidance from the government on testing priorities has fluctuated and even reversed. Just this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed its recommendations on testing for people without symptoms, even those who have recently been exposed to known coronavirus cases. Federal officials said pressure to make the change came from higher-ups in Washington at the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services. By Jeanna Smialek — Burgess Owens, former N.F.L. player It’s true that Black and Hispanic workers did see record-low unemployment during the Trump administration before the pandemic hit, but women did not — they had lower unemployment in the 1950s. It is also difficult to judge whether the groups have seen “unprecedented prosperity.” Poverty has come down in recent years, and wages have risen. But inequality has also risen, and economic outcomes have often been uneven. For instance, participation rates — the share of adults who are actually in jobs or looking — has fallen across demographic groups. It is also worth noting that the same groups who made recent labor market gains have in many cases been the hardest hit economically during the pandemic, although that was the result of the shock that hit the economy rather than the administration’s labor-related policies. Minority workers, women and those with lower education levels faced heavy job losses as service industries shut down across much of the country. By Nick Corasaniti — Lou Holtz, former football coach Like most Democrats, Mr. Biden supports abortion rights and has said he would codify Roe v. Wade into federal law and restore federal funding to reproductive-care facilities like Planned Parenthood. But he only reversed his support for the Hyde Amendment, which bars using federal money for most abortions, last year. And he has grappled for years over the issue of abortion.  There is no evidence that his campaign is more radical about abortion rights than most recent Democratic candidates. While there is plenty of room for subjective judgments about religious tenets and there are deep divisions between left and right about how politics should intersect with faith, Mr. Biden is a practicing Catholic. His wife, Dr. Jill Biden, said in her speech at the Democratic National Convention that her husband’s “faith is in the providence of God.” John Kasich, the former Republican governor of Ohio, called Mr. Biden “a man of faith.” And one of Mr. Biden’s close friends, Senator Chris Coons, offered a lengthy testimony to Mr. Biden’s faith, saying Mr. Biden would be “a president for Americans of all faiths, as well as people of conscience who practice no particular faith.” By Coral Davenport — Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa. Earlier this year, the Trump administration did roll back the Obama-era Waters of the United States rule, which had restored and extended the federal government’s authority to limit pollution in the nation’s rivers, lakes, streams and wetlands. President Trump echoed farm-state Republicans’ claims that the Obama-era water rule would have aggressively expanded the government’s authority to regulate on farmland. And the Iowa Farm Bureau suggested that, once fully enforced, the rule could be interpreted in such a way as to allow the federal government to regulate as much as 97 percent of the state’s land. But legal experts in federal water law say there is no basis for that claim. In fact, the Obama rule explicitly exempted from regulation many bodies of water found on farms, including puddles, ditches, artificial ponds for livestock watering, and certain farming irrigation systems. A 2016 study found that the E.P.A.’s jurisdiction over farms was slightly diminished under the new rule. By Katherine J. Wu  — Representative Lee M. Zeldin of New York In April, the Trump administration sent a trove of personal protective equipment, or P.P.E., to Suffolk County, where health workers had blown through stockpiles while battling an overwhelming surge in coronavirus cases. However, in many other parts of the country, shortages of P.P.E. persisted — some lasting even through present day. Across the country, doctors, nurses, and other health workers took to social media, pleading for masks. When they arrived, many were forced to ration their stocks, wearing single-use face coverings for days and sometimes weeks, all the while treating patients stricken with the coronavirus. By Rebecca R. Ruiz — Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa Ms. Ernst was referring to devastating wind storms that whipped through Iowa this month, and it’s true that Mr. Trump acted fast in granting part of the state’s request for help. He visited in the wake of the storms, and he promptly signed a disaster relief order. That order provided roughly $45 million for public utilities and buildings, but the president did not approve money that the state had requested for individual homeowners and farmers. By Reed Abelson — Kayleigh McEnany, White House press secretary While President Trump has paid lip service to protecting people who would have pre-existing medical conditions and may have provided support to Ms. McEnany during her recovery from a preventive mastectomy, he is currently trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. The federal law requires health insurers to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions and not charge them more when they have an expensive medical condition. He has also allowed the sale of short-term health insurance plans and association health plans that do not require pre-existing conditions to be covered. Some 54 million Americans are estimated to have pre-existing conditions that would likely disqualify them from coverage without the protections from the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Trump’s first legislative priority was to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act. Although those efforts failed, his Justice Department is now actively trying to overturn the entire law. The administration has also taken several steps to weaken the law by encouraging the sale of health plans that do not meet the standards of Obamacare. While Mr. Trump has repeatedly promised to introduce his own plan that would protect people with pre-existing conditions, he has not yet done so. By Ana Swanson — Scott Dane, executive director of the Associated Contract Loggers and Truckers of Minnesota The Minnesota logging industry struggled deeply during the Obama administration, but that was partly because former President Barack Obama’s entry into the White House coincided with the onset of the Great Recession and a historic crash in the housing market. In the early 2000s, a booming housing market led to record lumber consumption, according to the Western Wood Products Association. But in 2009, housing starts fell to a 50-year low, sharply decreasing demand for wood and wood products. The lumber industry had been automating and consolidating, and small mills in Minnesota that operated on slim profit margins were exceptionally hard hit. By Linda Qiu — Michael McHale, president of the National Association of Police Organizations  Across 25 large American cities, violent crime has risen by about 0.4 percent compared to the same period last year, according to the latest available data assembled by crime analysts at the consulting firm AH Datalytics. That’s a small uptick, not quite the lawless chaos Mr. McHale portrayed. He is correct, however, that murders have increased 26 percent. In Portland, New York and Chicago, violent crime has actually decreased by 7 percent, 3.3 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively. In Minneapolis, it has increased 13 percent. By Lara Jakes — Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee Speaker Nancy Pelosi was referring to an American intelligence report released earlier this month that concluded that China prefers that President Trump be defeated in November. “The Chinese, they said, prefer Biden over — we don’t know that, but that’s what they’re saying, but they’re not really getting involved in the presidential election,” Ms. Pelosi said during an Aug. 9 interview with “Fox News Sunday.” The “they” she was referring to was the intelligence officials who wrote the report, as is clear in this clip of the interview. As our colleague Julian Barnes has reported, the intelligence report also concluded that Russia is the far graver, and more immediate, threat in the election. In her interview on Fox, Ms. Pelosi objected to any suggestion that China posed as much of a threat as Russia does. “I’ve been a critic of China for over 30 years; I take second place to no one on my criticism of China,” Ms. Pelosi said. But for intelligence officials to compare China’s interest in the election to Russia’s “is not right, it doesn’t really tell the story,” she said. While China seeks to gain influence in American politics, its leaders have not yet decided to wade directly into the presidential contest, however much they may dislike Mr. Trump, intelligence officials said. By Rebecca R. Ruiz — Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee President Trump’s relationship with law enforcement is complicated and certainly not all positive. He has was won endorsements from police unions, like the powerful Fraternal Order of Police, and he has readily expressed support for police officers while emphasizing a law-and-order agenda. But Mr. Trump has also made sharp, public attacks on the nation’s top law enforcement officers — including on his own former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, as well as the former deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein. His pointed criticism of institutions like the Justice Department and F.B.I. — especially in the context of the special counsel inquiry focused on Russia’s interference in the election — has prompted Democrats and Republicans alike to express concern that he has eroded public confidence in law enforcement. And he has mercilessly mocked F.B.I. agents who investigated his campaign’s contacts with Russia, accusing them repeatedly of law breaking, even treason.
