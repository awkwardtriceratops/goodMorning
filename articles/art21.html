Will the uproar over President Trump’s reported remarks on the military shake things up? By Astead W. Herndon and Annie Karni Welcome to our weekly analysis of the state of the 2020 campaign. A batch of national polls released in the wake of the Democratic and Republican conventions showed Joe Biden leading President Trump by anywhere from seven to 10 percentage points. A variety of swing-state polls also out this week broadly showed Mr. Biden retaining his advantage, though not always by much. Fox News polls showed Mr. Biden with a nine-point lead in Arizona, an eight-point margin in Wisconsin and a narrower four-point edge in North Carolina. Monmouth University surveys showed North Carolina even closer, with Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump separated by just two points, and Mr. Biden up by four points in Pennsylvania. (Both of those differences were within the polls’ margins of error.)
