Kennedy. In his new book, he tells the story of not one person but a million. “The Last Million” is about Eastern Europeans stranded in Germany after the spring of 1945. These displaced persons included Jewish concentration camp survivors; Polish forced laborers; and Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian Nazi collaborators. “It was a shock to me, and is still infinitely distressing, to learn that the United States Congress did nothing to resettle, to offer refuge, to the victims of the Holocaust,” Nasaw says. “On the contrary, Truman, understanding that he could not get a majority in Congress to support the resettlement of the Jewish D.P.s, he pushed and pushed and pushed the British, who had the mandate over Palestine, to open Palestine to the quarter million Jewish survivors who were left in Germany. The British refused.” Carlos Lozada visits the podcast to discuss his new book, “What Were We Thinking: A Brief Intellectual History of the Trump Era.” Lozada, the nonfiction book critic for The Washington Post, read many, many books for the project, starting with those by Trump and directly about him but then moving outward from there.
