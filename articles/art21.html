Protest<br></h1><p id="artcont">Some demonstrators in New York have taken on informal but crucial roles over a summer of marches. Here’s how to spot them. By Juliana Kim Photographs by Simbarashe Cha Only a few weeks after the first of what would become near-daily Black Lives Matter protests in New York City, Justina Heckard found herself on her bicycle in Brooklyn, leading a march in loose formation with other cyclists. An altercation with a driver left a protester injured, and Ms. Heckard and her fellow demonstrators decided they would need to sharpen their tactics. As protest organizers learned to handle everything from physical confrontations to dehydration, they developed strategies and clearly defined roles designed to keep marches on track and participants safe. Some of these tactics, however, can put protesters in direct confrontation with both the police and bystanders. Here’s a breakdown of some of the most common roles. At a demonstration last month, Larry Malcolm Smith Jr., noticed a female protester quarreling with a photographer. She had told the man that she didn’t want to be photographed, Mr. Smith recalled. Although he had a right to photograph in public, the photographer seemed to be unusually aggressive. As a marshal, Mr. Smith, 21, was there to make sure that the demonstration ran smoothly. He intervened in the argument and told the photographer to move away from the woman. Mr. Smith said he tries to pay attention the needs of Black women. “There needs to be more Black men that come out and show up for Black women,” he said. Marshals tend to be scattered throughout a march — often equipped with bullhorns — and are there to answer questions and keep the energy alive in the middle and back end of a protest. Born in Jamaica, Queens, Mr. Smith began protesting at age 8, after Sean Bell, an unarmed Black man, was shot by plainclothes officers in Mr. Smith’s neighborhood. “I don’t feel like I chose activism,” he said. “Activism chose me.”
