By Mary M. Chapman and Campbell Robertson DETROIT — The idea that the Nov. 3 election in this city was so flawed and corrupt that it could simply be overruled by state officials was “outrageous,” according to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. “Very dangerous for our democracy,” said Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah. To Dale Rich, a 72-year-old genealogist and photographer in Detroit, it was even worse than that: unsurprising. “It’s just an extension of what’s been going on for many, many years to Blacks and Black communities,” he said. “They wouldn’t have pulled this stunt with a white community, but they’ve gotten away with so much with us for so long.” The decentralized nature of American elections means that any efforts to overturn a national vote, as President Trump is trying to do, would come down to a handful of states, then to a few counties and cities within those states. For now, one of the states in the president’s sights is Michigan, which is apparently why he summoned a delegation of Republican lawmakers from the state to the White House on Friday. Within Michigan, the place in the bull’s-eye is Wayne County, home of Detroit. “It changes the result of the election in Michigan,” said Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s lawyer, speaking at a news conference on Thursday, “if you take out Wayne County.” This is true. And to many residents of Detroit, which is around 80 percent Black, the largest share of any major U.S. city, it is a familiar sort of math. “This is not broken history, this is consistent,” said Lawrence Hightower, 69, a retired accountant who has been active in Detroit municipal politics for years. He acknowledged that some figures in Detroit, like the scandal-plagued former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, had not done the city’s reputation any favors. But he talked of a long line of attempts by white state leaders to take control of various city assets by citing mismanagement and abuse. He saw the latest election fraud allegations as all but predictable. “In this super-polarized environment in an all-Black city, when you know doggone well that Republicans have been intimidated by Trump’s 70 million votes, not surprising in the least,” Mr. Hightower said.
