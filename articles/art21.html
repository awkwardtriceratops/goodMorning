We miss theater, and we’re guessing many of you do, too. We’re putting together a free online event, scheduled for Oct. 1, where we’ll talk about theater’s meaning, its absence and its future. We’ll start with a conversation with Hillary Clinton, a lifelong theater-lover who, in the years since the 2016 election, has seen 39 plays and musicals in New York City (plus “Hamilton” in Puerto Rico). Then we’ll talk with the actors Audra McDonald, Neil Patrick Harris, Jessie Mueller and Danielle Brooks about their own lives in the theater, as fans and performers, and about their concerns during this protracted shutdown. McDonald is a six-time Tony Award-winning actress and a co-founder of Black Theater United; Harris is a Tony winner for “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” Mueller is a winner for “Beautiful,” and Brooks is a nominee for “The Color Purple.” You can R.S.V.P. here. And, if you’re game, please send us a photo from your theater life — maybe an image of a performance you were in, of your favorite show souvenir, or a scene from a stage door — and we’ll feature some of the photos as part of the event or in our coverage. You can submit an image by filling out this form (sorry!):  The event is the third episode of our streaming series, Offstage. You can watch (or rewatch!) the previous episodes below: A century ago, women won the right to vote in the United States. But that victory came only after a long-fought battle, and that battle is the subject of a new musical, “Suffragist,” now being developed by the songwriter Shaina Taub. On Aug. 13, Taub, accompanied by members of the show’s creative team and cast talked with New York Times journalists about the show’s pandemic-interrupted journey, and shared songs from the work in progress. You can watch the event here: The first episode of Offstage, which streamed on June 11, began with a conversation about racial justice, moderated by Times critic-at-large Wesley Morris, with four Black artists who worked on Broadway last season: the director Kenny Leon (“A Soldier’s Play”); the actress Celia Rose Gooding (“Jagged Little Pill”); and co-stars Adrienne Warren and Daniel J. Watts (“Tina: The Tina Turner Musical”). The second part of the episode, introduced by Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick and moderated by a team of Times culture journalists, featured performances by Mary-Louise Parker (“The Sound Inside”), Elizabeth Stanley (“Jagged Little Pill”), Mare Winningham (“Girl From the North Country”) and the casts of “Company” and “Six,” as well as interviews with Sonya Tayeh, who choreographed “Moulin Rouge!,” and Jeremy O. Harris, the author of “Slave Play.” You can watch it here: [Join the conversation on Twitter using #NYToffstage. |Sign up for The New York Times Events newsletter and Theater Update newsletter. | Subscribe to Times Events on YouTube.] </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
