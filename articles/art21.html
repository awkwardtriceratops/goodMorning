But long after it became clear that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. was the winner of this year’s election, there has been no sign from President Trump that he will concede. The transition is at a standstill. Far from encouraging Mr. Trump to acknowledge defeat, leading Republicans are bolstering his position, indulging the false narrative that it was stolen from him and steering clear of acknowledging Mr. Biden’s victory. It’s a delay that could have implications for national security, as well as for faith in democracy. Maggie Haberman, a White House correspondent for The Times. Days after President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. was declared the winner of the election, President Trump has still refused to concede. Advisers to the president say Mr. Trump is seeing how far he can push his case and ensure the continued support of his Republican base. A number of leading Republicans have rallied around the president, declining to challenge the false narrative that it was stolen from him. Instead, senators have tiptoed around the reality of Mr. Trump’s loss, and the lack of evidence to suggest widespread election fraud or improprieties that could reverse that result.
