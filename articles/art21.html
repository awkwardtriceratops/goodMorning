Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Thursday. Weather: The rain will gradually taper, but the temperature will sink to the mid-50s by midafternoon. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Saturday (Diwali). New York City is at a critical juncture once again. The seven-day average rate of positive test results has been steadily rising. On Wednesday, that rate was 2.52 percent — a number last seen in early June. Hospitalizations and virus deaths have been ticking upward, too, city data shows. With numbers rising across the five boroughs, Mayor Bill de Blasio wrote on Twitter: “This is our LAST chance to stop a second wave.” Here are five takeaways from a regional rise in cases: On Wednesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo ordered a series of statewide restrictions to begin on Friday. The governor said that private indoor and outdoor gatherings would be limited to 10 people and that gyms, bars and restaurants must close daily at 10 p.m. The borough’s seven-day positive test rate is the highest in the city, and two Staten Island ZIP codes have risen above 5 percent. On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo declared most of the borough a “yellow zone,” meaning that among other limitations, places of worship could operate only at 50 percent capacity. Health officials have not said why specifically they are seeing more cases on Staten Island, where Republican leaders have fought restrictions by Democrats who control the city. Joseph Borelli, a Republican city councilman who represents Staten Island, suggested two factors: police officers and firefighters, many of whom live on the island, could get the virus at work and bring it home; and his borough’s closeness with New Jersey, which was seeing a huge rise in cases. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said that he would shutter schools if the city exceeds a 3 percent rate in positive tests over a seven-day rolling average. City Hall officials told my colleague Eliza Shapiro this week that the mayor would stick to his promise, and that plans for how to reopen schools after a shutdown were in the works. But not everyone is on board with the possibility of a school closure, which would affect both staff members and the approximately 300,000 students who receive some in-person instruction. Some parents have noted that the positivity rate in schools is very low — just 0.17 percent, according to the most recent data. [N.Y.C. schools may close again, a grim sign of a global dilemma.] There have been no signs of relief for New York City’s collapsing real estate sales market. The decline has already cost the city and state more than $1.4 billion in lost tax revenue, according to a report released on Thursday by the Real Estate Board of New York. The steepest declines in residential sales have been in Manhattan, which has also seen a drastic drop in average rental prices, down nearly 9 percent from this time last year, according to the brokerage Douglas Elliman. During the virus’s peak in New York, many of the borough’s wealthy residents fled to the suburbs and second homes. New Jersey reported 3,078 new cases on Wednesday and 15 virus-related deaths. The state has a seven-day average positivity rate of 7.95 percent. Starting today, restaurants and nightclubs must end indoor service at 10 p.m., and high school sports teams are barred from traveling to out-of-state tournaments. [The coronavirus outbreak accelerates in New Jersey’s largest city.] In Newark, the state’s largest city, 19 percent of people tested over three days last week were found to have the virus. The mayor, Ras J. Baraka, has implemented a 9 p.m. weekday curfew for residents in three ZIP codes, and indoor and outdoor gatherings are capped at 10 people until at least December. Team sports are canceled, and nursing homes are barred from accepting visitors for the next two weeks. “I know we are all tired,” Mr. Baraka said in a statement, “but the virus is not.” Matthew Haag contributed reporting.
