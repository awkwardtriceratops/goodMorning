Also: Pandemic and housing updates. By Jill Cowan Good morning. Recently, I spoke with Alex Lee, who was elected last month to represent his San Jose-area district in the State Assembly after Kansen Chu, the incumbent, said he wouldn’t run again. Mr. Lee, 25, beat out a crowded field in the Democratic primary for the seat and has made headlines as California’s first Generation Z lawmaker. He’ll also be the first openly bisexual person to become a state legislator. Here’s our conversation, edited and condensed for length and clarity: Congratulations, first of all. Tell me a little about yourself and your background — and also how you decided to run for State Assembly of all offices. State lawmakers in California of course have a lot of power, but I don’t think people always realize it. I’m 25 years old, the same number as my district right now, which is a fact I like. But when I started running this campaign in June 2019, I was still working for Assemblymember Evan Low in his field district office. And before that I had worked in the State Capitol for State Senator Henry Stern. And both were young record-breakers of their own. Henry was the first millennial in the State Senate, and Evan was the youngest Asian-American state legislator before me. I felt like we have a Democratic ultra, super majority, right? We have all the executive positions. And yet we can’t seem to do the things that are big and progressive. We haven’t gotten universal health care, or even close to it. We haven’t guaranteed housing for everyone. Wealth inequality is out of control. There’s something deeply wrong about that. And I think that frustration in the system drove me to run. What are your top priorities? The theme of what will hopefully be my first term is going to be housing security and affordability, and getting corporate money out of politics. On Dec. 7, which is swearing-in day, I’m going to introduce a bill to prohibit candidates in California from taking corporate money or business entity money and to build a publicly financed election system to incentivize people to opt out. What’s your approach to housing? The big picture is figured out: the three P’s. It’s the production of housing, the preservation of existing affordable housing, and protection of working families and renters. My ultimate goal is to lean on public social housing as a strong alternative means for the production of housing. Right now, the for-profit market has basically a monopoly on housing production. And cities and localities basically can only negotiate within those confines. I am also keen to get rid of Costa-Hawkins. You represent Santa Clara County, Silicon Valley — cities that have not historically been particularly friendly to even multifamily development. What do you say to constituents who are hesitant about denser development? I’ll be honest — it’s not the easiest conversation to have because everyone has some opinion about it. But every single person in my district does have the same wants. What they want is for housing to be affordable for their kids, for themselves, or their grandparents or families. [Hear more from Gen Z in their own words.] How has being Gen Z — and I’m talking specifically about growing up as a digital native, living through this era, not just being in your 20s — shaped the way you think about these issues? Look, I live at home and I am going to live at home, I think, for the foreseeable future. But it’s funny because I always see the comments saying you’re 25, you’re not Gen Z, and then there’s all these different questions about — Do you identify as Gen Z? Yes, yes I do. At the end of the day, it’s an arbitrary social construct, but it’s an important frame of mind. We are a generation that has grown up and understood that we are being screwed over. When we think about the millennial generation, I think there are a lot who cling onto that 1990s hope that you can work hard and it will all work out. And that is kind of changing. Not to be completely reductive. But I think there’s a different relationship once you understand the world is utterly screwed unless we do something about it. Why not go down swinging as hard as we can and go fight the big fight? (This article is part of the California Today newsletter. Sign up to get it delivered to your inbox.)
