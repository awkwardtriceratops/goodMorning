By Gail Collins and Bret Stephens Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every week. Gail Collins: Bret, when Joe Biden finally got to give his postelection speech on Saturday night, he reached out to Trump voters who were disappointed about the results. Very typical for Biden, and given the fact that his opponent was sulking in silence — except for a few angry tweets — it did set a heck of a new tone. Bret Stephens: Don’t tell anyone, Gail, but I was profoundly moved by his speech. Biden is so … normal. And I was also moved by the sight of the Biden and Harris families on the stage. It looked like the great American family, as opposed to the barbarian cyborgs of the opposing team. Gail: The minute Biden’s win was projected, people poured onto the corner of Broadway near my apartment and started cheering and waving to the passing drivers, who kept honking their horns. It reminded me of the films of Times Square when the end of World War II was announced. Was that the last time people were so happy about a public event? You know, if somebody traveled back through time and showed videos of the postelection celebrations to Americans in, say, 2015, I doubt any of them would believe this wild euphoria was in honor of Good Old Joe. Bret Stephens: The moment really requires a musical interlude. I’m thinking of the “Hallelujah” chorus from Handel’s “Messiah.” Trump lost! Our president-elect is a good and decent man through whom there courses the milk of human kindness! Our vice president-elect is an inspiration to my daughters! Our long national nightmare will soon be over.
