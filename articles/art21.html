TRANSCRIPT Your patience is commendable. We knew this was going to go long, but who knew we’re going to go into maybe tomorrow morning, maybe even longer? But look, we feel good about where we are. [cheering] We really do. [cheering and cars honking] I’m here to tell you tonight we believe we’re on track to win this election. [cheering and cars honking] We knew because of the unprecedented early vote and the mail-in vote that it’s going to take a while. We’re going to have to be patient until the hard work of tallying the votes is finished. And it ain’t over till every vote is counted, every ballot is counted. [cheering and cars honking] But we’re feeling good. We’re feeling good about where we are. Look, you know, we could know the results as early as tomorrow morning. But it may take a little longer. As I’ve said all along, it’s not my place or Donald Trump’s place to declare who’s won this election. That’s the decision of the American people. But I’m optimistic about this outcome, and I want to thank every one of you who came out and voted in this election. By Reid J. Epstein and Glenn Thrush Joseph R. Biden Jr. started election night with many paths to 270 electoral votes, but by Wednesday morning President Trump had won Florida, Ohio and Texas and was within striking distance of winning North Carolina. But while the number of winning scenarios for Mr. Biden had diminished, it was the former vice president, and not the current president, who went on offense Wednesday, gathering momentum in his effort to recapture Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, once-reliable “blue wall” states. Mr. Trump’s path as of late Wednesday was considerably narrower, and centered on his winning Pennsylvania’s 20 Electoral College votes — in conjunction with other scenarios that involve holding Georgia, erasing Mr. Biden’s lead in Arizona and flipping Nevada, the shakiest state in Mr. Biden’s map. By Wednesday afternoon, The Associated Press had declared Mr. Biden the winner in Wisconsin, and he took a lead in Michigan as Democratic areas of the state began reporting more results. If Mr. Biden were to flip both states — along with winning Nevada, a blue state where he had a narrow lead — that would leave him with two clear and plausible paths to victory: He could win Pennsylvania, a state that seemed to be swinging to his advantage as the count of early and mail-in balloting began. Or he could take Arizona — which has already been declared a Biden victory by several major news organizations even though hundreds of thousands of votes remain to be counted. Mr. Biden even has a third path, less likely than the other two, but still viable: Winning Georgia, as an influx of mail-in ballots from Atlanta and its suburbs cut into what seemed like an insurmountable Trump lead late Wednesday. If he were to pick up Arizona, Georgia and Nevada, winning Pennsylvania and Michigan would be unnecessary. In a call with reporters early Wednesday, Mr. Biden’s team expressed confidence that the former vice president would win by taking the “easy” path, along the old “blue wall” in the Midwest and Appalachia. That had seemed less plausible late Tuesday, when Mr. Trump jumped out to a 700,000-vote lead in Pennsylvania. But many ballots remained to be counted, and absentee voting in particular was expected to favor Mr. Biden because many Democratic voters made use of mail balloting during the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans are expressing confidence Mr. Trump will ultimately prevail in Arizona, but Mr. Biden retained a slim edge there, and the president’s aides privately conceded that a Biden win there would deal a devastating blow to their chances of winning nationwide. A Biden victory in Arizona, coupled with victories in Michigan and Nevada, would put him at precisely 270 electoral votes — sans Pennsylvania. “Joe Biden’s path is largely unchanged since he entered this race,” Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, a leading Democratic super PAC, said early Wednesday. “There are still at least five competitive states giving him multiple paths to 270. It may take a couple of days to count the votes, and we may need to fight the Trump campaign in court, but Joe Biden remains the favorite.” Mr. Trump’s victories in Florida, Ohio and Texas did not create a new path for him so much as close off new shortcuts by which Mr. Biden could have claimed victory on Election Day. His last chance for a flip is Nevada, another tight race, but one in which most of the uncounted votes are generally expected to favor Mr. Biden. Otherwise, Mr. Trump’s path to winning a second term depends on holding onto Pennsylvania and Michigan, two battlegrounds he won in 2016, and on retaining Georgia and North Carolina. “Trump’s path is exactly the same as it was in 2016,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who is a veteran of Senator Marco Rubio’s campaigns. “He needs to overperform in some traditionally blue states. Trump wins when the voters Democrats take for granted no longer reliably vote for Democrats.” In Nebraska — one of two states, along with Maine, that split their electoral votes by congressional district — Mr. Biden won the state’s Second Congressional District, which includes Omaha. The Nebraska Democratic Party chairwoman, Jane Kleeb, declared victory early Wednesday. “Omaha is now Joe-maha,” she said. Because Mr. Biden won that lone Nebraska electoral vote, it kept open the path that allows him to win Arizona, Michigan and Nevada and reach exactly 270 electoral votes. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
