But just six weeks after they got married, Liz hit a wall. She found herself in an airport, en route to Milan, tempted by a cold escape. “It felt like eating glass while I said it,” Liz told Miya, a host of the podcast, reflecting on the first time she told her wife, Sarah, about her problems with alcohol. But “to Sarah’s credit,” Liz said, “she gave me the room. She just said, OK, what might you want to do?” In today’s Tiny Love Story, E.J. writes that love is like “the workout where you squat and catch the medicine ball at the same time. It’s falling and lifting at once.” Hosted by: Daniel Jones and Miya Lee
