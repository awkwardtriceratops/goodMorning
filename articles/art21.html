On Tuesday night, a group of armed men, who claimed to be there to protect the community, arrived. Three protesters were shot, two of whom died. Kyle Rittenhouse, a white 17-year-old from Illinois, is suspected of being the gunman. We speak with Julie Bosman, a national correspondent for The Times, about what is happening in her hometown.
