What exactly are the consequences of voting twice? By Nick Corasaniti and Stephanie Saul First, President Trump suggested voters in North Carolina show up at the polls after casting an absentee ballot to test the integrity of the state’s electoral system. Then the secretary of state of Georgia said he would prosecute “to the fullest extent of the law” hundreds of cases where a voter cast an absentee ballot and also voted in person. Now one of the most fundamental pillars of voting in the country has been mired in confusion: What happens if you vote twice? The short answer: Intentionally “voting more than once” is federally prohibited in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and territories. But as most election law is defined at the state level, there are varying degrees of punishment, as well as safeguards, in place to prevent someone from voting twice. And there are some quirks in the law. New York, for example, encourages voting twice. (We’ll explain this later but it has nothing to do with Tammany Hall.) At least 28 states expressly classify voting twice in the same election as a felony in their election law statute, according to a database maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan research group. Several states make it an infraction or misdemeanor.
