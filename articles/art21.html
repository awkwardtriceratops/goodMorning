By Isabel Kershner JERUSALEM — Israeli forces struck Syria early Wednesday, a day after finding antipersonnel mines in Israeli-held territory along the boundary between the two countries and just hours before a visit by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his Bahraini counterpart to mark a new, U.S.-brokered normalization deal. Israel said the latest strikes were aimed at Syria and Iranian targets. They were part of a long-running campaign as Israel tries to thwart what it describes as a concerted effort by Iran to entrench itself on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau that overlooks northern Israel. The foreign minister of Bahrain, Abdul Latif bin Rashid al-Zayani, landed in Israel soon after the airstrikes for the first official visit since the two countries agreed in September to normalize relations. That deal followed a similar agreement between Israel and Bahrain’s Gulf neighbor, the United Arab Emirates. Mr. Pompeo arrived later on Wednesday and was expected to attend a trilateral meeting in Jerusalem of Israeli, Bahraini and American officials. Mr. al-Zayani and Israel’s foreign minister, Gabi Ashkenazi, said they had agreed to open embassies in each other’s countries as soon as possible. “We addressed the importance of regional stability, as well as the need to combat terrorism and extremism and to build in its place a culture of dialogue and understanding,” Mr. al-Zayani said at a joint news conference after their meeting. He added that he had invited Mr. Ashkenazi to attend next month’s Manama Dialogue, a meeting in Bahrain on regional and international security cooperation. “Developments like today’s visit, which would have appeared impossible only a few months ago, now seem to happen almost weekly,” Mr. al-Zayani added.
