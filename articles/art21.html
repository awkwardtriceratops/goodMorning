By Virginia Sole-Smith For Jeanelle Olsen, the anxiety began when it came time to change out of what she lovingly calls her “House Pants.” That would be a pair of “very comfortable, very stretchy, wide-legged pants,” that Olsen, mom to a 5-year-old and 10-month-old near Chicago, wore nonstop from March to May. Then the weather warmed up, her kids wanted to play outside, and Olsen wanted to chat with neighbors, from a safe social distance. “I realized, ‘oh, I think I have to get capital-D dressed, to walk out of the house and see other humans,’” Olsen said. “But I am postpartum, and mid-quarantine, and I have gained weight. My aversion to jeans is even higher than normal. And I noticed that my mind immediately went from ‘OK, so clothes aren’t fitting’ to ‘well, what should I be eating?’” It was a triggering thought for the mother of two, who had previously struggled with disordered eating as a teenager, and now described herself as “a self-affirmed fat person,” who does not diet. But the pressure of pandemic motherhood left her grasping for her usual coping strategies.

After the kids are in bed, I could have my Oreos and milk and feel like things are going to be OK.” Olsen stands by the Oreos, but adjusting to her weight gain has been tricky. “I’m trying hard not to restrict, not to go back to old patterns,” she said. During the pandemic, parents are navigating the confines of isolation along with the pressures to re-enter a changed world in a body that hasn’t gotten out of House Pants in five months, to say nothing of our looming school stress. And then there are our children who need another snack and another snack and what’s for lunch. “You have to nourish your kids’ bodies all day and you don’t get a break from that right now, and you also have to figure out how to nourish your own body,” said Rachel Millner, Psy. D., an eating disorder therapist in private practice in Doylestown, Pa. For many of us, that means cookies after the kids are in bed. For parents with a history of dieting or eating disorders, it may bring a return to more troubling habits, like skipping meals, binge eating and purging. The National Eating Disorder Association saw a 78 percent increase in messages sent to their helpline in March and April compared to that time period last year. And an Australian study of 5,469 people published last month, found that 64.5 percent of those with a history of eating disorders reported that they were restricting their food intake more since the pandemic, while 35.5 percent reported more binge eating. “At their core, disordered eating behaviors are coping strategies,” said Lisa Du Breuil, a psychotherapist who treats patients with eating disorders at Massachusetts General Hospital. “When we’re under stress, we fall back on what’s most familiar. We are all living with this ongoing existential threat. Of course that’s going to show up in your eating.” When stay-at-home orders were first put in place, therapists and dietitians who treat individuals with eating disorders immediately began to worry about the disruption to their clients’ daily routines. “Pre-Covid, you had lunch breaks, the school day, bedtimes, and all these other external cues that once provided a structure for basic self-care activities,” said Ayana Habtermariam, a nutrition therapist in private practice in Arlington, Va. “Parents are now having to recreate on their own.” The lack of social interaction was another risk. “Eating disorders thrive in isolation, because there’s already so much shame and stigma; a lot of the behaviors are done in secret,” Millner said. “When you are literally isolated all day and don’t have the same opportunities to sit down and eat with other people, the disorder will intensify.” As the pandemic has progressed, therapists say the toll of that isolation is only deepening, as people feel increasingly anxious, depressed and lonely. But reopening cities brings new stresses. After all, isolation offers one small reprieve from body dissatisfaction. “I have a lot of clients who have felt some relief from the focus on their body because they’re not seeing other people, and they are able to spend the day in comfortable clothes,” Millner said. Now, the comfort of that loungewear life is replaced by new fears around whether old clothes will fit, or if others will notice how our bodies have changed. “You may also be worrying about whether your kids’ bodies have changed, and will people judge you for that,” Millner said. This transition is heightened by social media memes about the “Quarantine 15,” many of which are directed at mothers. “The primary lesson diet culture teaches us is that we should beat ourselves up for every mistake we make,” said Irina Gonzalez, a mom in Fort Myers, Fla., who gave birth to her first child on March 30. Gonzalez said having a newborn during a pandemic has been difficult: “None of our friends were able to come over and offer that new-mom comfort of bringing meals; I don’t have that village of support that I had heard about.” But even more, Gonzalez is struggling with how much the usual new-mom pressures to diet are compounded by her isolation. “I’m breastfeeding and I’m home all the time, so I’m in my body even more,” she said. “I wear lots of little shorts and tank tops because I find that easier for breastfeeding. But I almost hate wearing them because I grew up overweight, and I was always told I don’t look good in shorts.”
