By Concepción de León The Milwaukee Bucks player Sterling Brown has reached a tentative agreement under which he would receive $750,000 to settle a lawsuit that he filed against the city in 2018, after the police used a Taser to subdue and arrest him in a confrontation over a parking violation. Details of the agreement, which requires the approval of the Milwaukee Common Council, are included in a letter of recommendation that the city attorney, Tearman Spencer, sent to the council on Wednesday. On Friday, Mr. Brown signed the agreement, which would include an admission of a constitutional violation by the city and a commitment to changes in operating procedures by the Police Department. Mr. Spencer’s office and the president of the Common Council did not immediately respond to phone calls or emails on Monday afternoon, and it was unclear when the Council would consider the recommendation. Mr. Brown’s lawyer, Mark Thomsen, declined to comment on the tentative agreement on Monday. In a statement on Monday, the Bucks said the team was “pleased that Sterling’s lawsuit has been mutually resolved.” “No one should ever have to go through the horrifying abuse and injustice that Sterling experienced,” the Bucks said. “We commend Sterling for his courageous response to this terrible situation by repeatedly sharing his story and working tirelessly with countless local groups and organizations to help make change in our community.” In 2019, Mr. Brown rejected a settlement offer by the city for $400,000 because it did not include an admission of guilt by the city, Mr. Thomsen said at the time. A Milwaukee police officer confronted Mr. Brown in January 2018, because his car was parked in a handicapped spot. The situation escalated quickly with multiple police vehicles being called to the scene. Video of the episode shows officers pushing Mr. Brown to the ground at one point and using a Taser on him after he did not immediately take his hands out of his pockets when ordered to do so. The police did not pursue criminal charges against Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown contended in his original complaint that the police officers used excessive force because he is Black. Speaking about the confrontation on “Good Morning America” in 2018, the Milwaukee Bucks guard said he was angered every time he watched the footage because he felt “defenseless.” Mr. Spencer, the Milwaukee city attorney, wrote in his letter to the council that he recommended the settlement “because of the unpredictability of a trial, and the city’s risk for exposure to compensatory and punitive damages, as well as additional attorney fees and costs.” The announcement came after months of protests against police brutality and calls for police reform across the country. Mr. Spencer’s letter expressed a commitment to changes in the Milwaukee Police Department’s operating procedures, though details were not specified. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
