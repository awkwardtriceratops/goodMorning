Now His Business Is Sinking.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Small, minority-owned travel agencies in New York, already pummeled by internet websites, are facing further devastation because of the pandemic. By Daniel E. Slotnik Ahmed Al-Hassan was country-hopping in Africa when the coronavirus pandemic shut down travel across much of the continent. He and his wife, Rosy, faced an indefinite stay at an airport in Nairobi, Kenya, with no easy way to return home to New York. If anyone could help, it was Mr. Al-Hassan’s travel agent, David Anokye, even if he was half a world away in the Bronx. So, Mr. Al-Hassan called Mr. Anokye, who answered in the middle of the night and quickly managed to secure tickets to New York. Within a day, the couple were in the air. “We met other passengers who were stranded for four or five days,” Mr. Al-Hassan said. “They couldn’t go anywhere.” While the cessation of most travel was an inconvenience for Mr. Al-Hassan, it could deal an existential blow to Mr. Anokye’s business and agencies like it in New York and across the country. Even in the internet age, when plane tickets, hotel rooms and car rentals are just a click away, many people still prefer using agents, who can help navigate confusing government bureaucracies and deal with visa and passport issues. Agents can also find deals that even savvy users of travel websites might miss. In the New York area, many travel agencies are minority-owned small businesses that are closely tied to immigrant communities, where people often prefer working with agents familiar with their homelands. Now, an industry that has already been hurt by the dominance of travel websites is facing further devastation because of the pandemic. A recent survey of roughly 1,600 of the nearly 14,400 members of the American Society of Travel Advisors, an industry group, found that almost three-fourths said their business would not survive longer than six months if travel remained at low levels. In the New York City region, the group counts about 2,400 agencies with nearly 15,000 employees. While many travel agencies, like other small businesses, have been helped by emergency federal aid, including loans and grants, the long-term outlook remains bleak given the restrictions imposed by many countries to help stop the spread of the virus. “Federal funding has temporarily stopped the hemorrhaging, but we’re still bleeding,” said Erika A. Richter, a spokeswoman for the American Society of Travel Advisors. “No matter what, our industry is going to have scars to show for it.” Sharad Agarwal, 60, owns SN Travel and Tours, which he operates from his home in New Jersey and an office in the Jackson Heights neighborhood in Queens. It mainly caters to travelers to and from India, he said.
