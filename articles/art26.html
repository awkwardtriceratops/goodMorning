RIGHT NOW The National Weather Service has canceled a “red flag” warning of increased fire danger for the Bay Area. Clusters of devastating wildfires continued to rage in Northern California on Monday, though there was some relief for firefighters: A turn in the weather did not deliver a feared barrage of new lightning strikes overnight. More than 14,000 firefighters have been scrambling to protect communities from two dozen major blazes, which have left at least seven people dead and dozens injured, and have forced more than 100,000 people from their homes. Roughly 1.1 million acres have burned since Aug. 15, according to Cal Fire, the state’s firefighting agency. Almost 700,000 acres of that have been in the groups of fires known as the L.N.U. Lightning Complex and the S.C.U. Lightning Complex, which have become the second- and third-largest fires in state history. Maps showing the extents of the major fires in Northern California. On Monday morning, the largest, the L.N.U. complex, which stretches across Napa and surrounding counties, was 22 percent contained. The S.C.U. complex, which has burned more than 347,000 acres to the east of San Jose, was 10 percent contained. Many of the hundreds of fires burning across the state having been sparked by lightning strikes, and there were fears that a new round of dry lightning storms Sunday and Monday would make matters worse. But the lighting strikes so far have not been widespread, and moisture has helped to diminish some of the fires. “Mother Nature has helped us quite a bit,” said Billy See, a Cal Fire assistant chief. “We’re going to hopefully see a little bit of a quieter period,” said David King, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in the Bay Area. “We didn’t see the thousands and thousands of lightning flashes that we saw last week. But we did see lightning strikes, and it only takes one strike to potentially start a new wildfire.” Mr. King added that firefighters would still have to deal with warm, dry weather, and the smoky haze in the region was likely to linger. The weather also helped firefighters make progress against the C.Z.U. Lightning Complex north of Santa Cruz, which has grown to 78,000 acres but is now 13 percent contained. A 70-year-old man was killed in the fire and found near his home, officials said at a news conference on Monday, adding that he was “likely leaving the fire” in his vehicle. They added that the city of Santa Cruz was not under a direct threat, though thousands of residents from the area are still under evacuation orders.

Chelsea Sterrett and her husband, both high school teachers, were in the midst of their first week of online instruction when they were ordered to evacuate, as the River Fire, south of Salinas, approached last week. So they packed up their three children (ages 7, 5 and 1) and a dog, and left home to stay with family friends whom they hadn’t seen in months because of the pandemic. “The immediate crisis of the fire was bigger than our concerns about Covid,” Ms. Sterrett wrote. Kevin Susco wrote in an email late last week that his daughter-in-law asked on Tuesday if she and her son, who were under an evacuation warning in Boulder Creek, could stay with him and his wife in Palo Alto. Their son, he said, is an Army Reservist currently in Kuwait. “We’ve been together only briefly since the pandemic, because my wife and I are both in our sixties, and we take the threat from the virus seriously,” he wrote in an email. “But we didn’t think about it too much before we said, sure, come over if you need to evacuate.” Deborah Meltzer, 67, said in an email that she’s one of a growing number of baby boomers who are live-in caregivers to aging parents — in her case, her 100-year-old father. She lives in Elk Grove, where smoke has filled the air and the dangers, both from the fires and the poor air, are constantly on her mind. “Quite frankly, I am not sure what I would do or where I would take my dad in the event of an evacuation,” she said. In Napa County, some local residents seemed unfazed by the wildfires over the weekend, expressing a weary acceptance. They’re used to this. “It’s the new normal — what next?” said Bulah Cartwright, the manager of Inti, a clothing and jewelry store in Napa. “We’ve had earthquakes, fires, flooding. It’s exhausting, but we’ll get through. We’ve gotten through worse.” Wine country residents are well aware of the perils posed by wildfires. The Tubbs fire swept through the area in 2017, devastating the town of Santa Rosa and killing 22 people. Last year, the Kincade Fire destroyed hundreds of buildings, including much of the Soda Rock winery in Healdsburg. But shop owners and residents said on Saturday that they were more concerned that the smoke and flames might drive away the tourists upon whom the region relies. “Business has been slow, obviously,” said Thea Witsil, the owner of Wildcat Vintage Clothing in Napa. It might seem busy on a Saturday, she said, but “come here in the middle of the week, it’s a completely different story.” Many tourists, though, were also undeterred by the persistent fumes that blew through Napa Valley towns and partially obscured nearby hills. “We feel bad doing all this nice stuff when people are having to evacuate and lose their homes, but at the same time, if we cancel, we leave a lot of them, as employees, in the dust,” said Daniel, who was visiting Yountville from Los Angeles for his birthday and declined to provide his last name. “I feel like if Covid’s taught us anything, you have got to try to enjoy things and work around life as you can.” Reporting was contributed by Kellen Browning, Jill Cowan, Jacey Fortin and Lucy Tompkins. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
