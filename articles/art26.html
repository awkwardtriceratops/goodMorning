By Winnie Hu When the coronavirus outbreak crippled New York City’s economy, it not only emptied the streets and office towers in Manhattan. It also devastated dozens of small business districts across the city, many located far from tourist and commuter hubs. The districts have served as a support network for mom-and-pop stores and restaurants, and have brought jobs, services and economic development to neighborhoods, helping New York recover from the great recession and fueling the boom it was experiencing before the pandemic. Now, many of these commercial corridors face daunting challenges as their foot traffic has dwindled, and many stores, restaurants and other businesses are struggling to pay rent and keep workers employed. The recovery of the local economy will be shaped by how these small business districts rebound just as much as by how larger destinations like Midtown and Lower Manhattan — the city’s commercial centers — do, business leaders and economic experts say. The four boroughs outside of Manhattan have increasingly played a crucial role in the city’s expanding economy. Over half of the 482,728 private-sector jobs created in the city from 2014 to 2019, or 247,991 of those jobs, were based in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island, according to state labor data. Brooklyn outpaced every other borough during that period. One in five jobs in Brooklyn has been created since 2014, compared with one in 10 jobs in Manhattan. In recent months, many businesses have reopened in Downtown Brooklyn, including a shopping strip on Fulton Street and DeKalb Market Hall, the borough’s largest food hall, which has created an open-air market with vendors serving customers on the sidewalk. But foot traffic is still down by more than half, to 1.5 million pedestrians in July compared with 3.4 million in July of last year, said Regina Myer, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, an economic development group. “It’s one of the key areas of the city that needs to bounce back,” she said. In the Norwood neighborhood in the Bronx, storefront businesses owe thousands of dollars in back rent and many face the threat of eviction, said Jennifer Tausig, executive director of the Jerome Gun Hill Business Improvement District, which has drafted a form letter to help them negotiate with their landlords. It also started a free delivery service so stores and restaurants could reach more customers. In Queens, only 5 to 10 percent of the tenants in office buildings in Long Island City have returned, and many museums and cultural institutions remain shuttered, leaving local restaurants and stores with few customers, said Elizabeth Lusskin, the president of the Long Island City Partnership, also an economic development group. “There are signs of life, but we’re not off life support,” Ms. Lusskin said. “We’re starting to see some smaller businesses close. The more commercial the area, the more stress they’re under.” Citywide, business improvement districts spent more than $167 million annually on local neighborhood and business services, according to a city report for the recent fiscal year. They include providing marketing help to small businesses, creating public spaces, picking up street trash and holding events to attract visitors. The New York City Business Improvement District Association, which represents 93,000 businesses in 76 neighborhoods, has warned that many storefront retailers, service providers and restaurants entrepreneurs are “grappling with health concerns, operational challenges and social unrest in their beloved neighborhoods, all of which make recovery seem like an impossible dream.” The association has sought help from the city and state, including rent and mortgage relief for small businesses, less burdensome regulations, and a point person in City Hall to oversee neighborhood business recovery efforts. Jonathan Bowles, the executive director of the Center for an Urban Future, a nonprofit research and policy organization, said many commercial neighborhoods had suffered the city’s worst economic losses. “The restaurants and retailers in these neighborhoods have really hit the losing trifecta,” he said. “Office workers haven’t come back. Tourists are not coming. And many local residents have decamped to their second homes.” City officials said they were reviewing the association’s request and had provided business districts with millions of free face masks and connected them with resources to help their recovery. “Our small businesses are the core of New York City’s economy and we have worked tirelessly to lift them up and support them throughout the pandemic,” Julia Arredondo, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said.
