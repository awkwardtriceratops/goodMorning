By Brad Lander Mr. Lander is a member of the New York City Council. The last time New York City faced a cataclysmic economic threat, city leaders responded by cutting the social safety net and infrastructure investment, laying off thousands of workers and turning over public land to developers who got big tax breaks. Those leaders have been called “champions” who saved New York City after it almost went bankrupt in 1975. But the austerity and privatization they imposed paved the way for the inequality crisis where the wealthy thrive and so many others fight to survive. Wall Street, Broadway and SoHo boomed, but artists and average workers couldn’t afford to live here. Small-business owners started new ventures but were priced out of affordable commercial space. Immigrant families worked hard but struggled mightily to pay skyrocketing rents. So as the havoc of Covid-19 stirs the same dire warnings of New York’s demise as were heard during the 1970s fiscal crisis, history provides lessons in how not to respond. Fortunately it also provides a lesson for how we can rebound, using social ownership of land to help create a just, vibrant and durable recovery. When the Brooklyn Navy Yard slowly declined after it was decommissioned in the 1960s, it could have been sold to a vulture fund to convert it to condos. Instead, the city put the yard under the control of a nonprofit development organization that generated a rebirth of manufacturing, innovation and entrepreneurship, beginning in the mid-1990s. Today 500 companies employ over 11,000 people in good jobs there, and an innovative high school prepares young people for STEM careers. When Covid-19 hit, many of those companies started manufacturing P.P.E. together. In Chelsea, the city took over another property that was deemed blighted and, working with labor unions in the 1960s, created Penn South, a democratically controlled housing cooperative that limits resale prices to keep homes affordable. Over the past 50 years, Penn South, Mitchell-Lama and other limited-equity cooperatives have survived as other affordable housing has been privatized, providing a total of around 90,000 units of permanently affordable housing. We should do all we can to help tenants and business owners survive, with less-onerous small-business recovery leases that colleagues and I have proposed, and more ambitious models for rent relief that require action in Washington and Albany. But where properties fall into distress or face abandonment in the coming months, let’s follow the lessons of Penn South and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Instead of letting distressed properties be auctioned off when owners default on mortgages and taxes, the city should step in. We could acquire and hold these properties temporarily through a city-controlled land bank, based on legislation I’ve introduced, and then transfer them to a growing network of community land trusts, nonprofit entities that hold land in perpetuity for publicly beneficial uses. The city already plans to spend $8 billion in public capital funds on affordable housing and economic development over the next five years. A vast majority is slated for private, for-profit developers. Redirecting some of that to social ownership is a better long-term public investment. Residential property (including failed hotels) should become permanently affordable rental or cooperative housing like Penn South — what European countries call “social housing” — so that the generation of New Yorkers coming of age in this crisis will be able to imagine a future here. In 2016, a report by Comptroller Scott Stringer found that a community land bank could support the development of 57,275 units of affordable housing on vacant land that is already publicly owned and on privately owned tax-delinquent properties. For commercial properties, a citywide version of the Brooklyn Navy Yard development can provide affordable space for manufacturing, tech and sustainability-focused companies that commit to hire and train local residents, side by side with local arts organizations, youth employment programs and the locally owned small businesses that make New York City the place we love. We don’t yet know how many additional properties will fall into distress in the current crisis or how many we might be able to convert to social uses. But we need to get started now, before the feeding frenzy starts. After the Great Recession in 2008, spurred on by government tax breaks, private equity and hedge funds spent $36 billion to purchase more than 200,000 foreclosed homes across the country. The buyers converted so many into market-rate, investor-owned rental properties that they markedly decreased the U.S. homeownership rate. If we want things to go differently this time, we need to move quickly. In recent years, our conversation about the city’s future has too often devolved into a debate between growth and equity. They are not mutually exclusive. Turning distressed assets into public goods can let more New Yorkers benefit from the city’s growth and provide a stronger platform for the creativity we need to secure our future.
