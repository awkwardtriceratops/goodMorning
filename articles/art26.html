Our event has wrapped up. You can watch the recording below.  In a text message to supporters Tuesday afternoon, Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, announced the choice that had taken him a long time to make: Kamala Harris is his running mate. Ms. Harris, a Senator from California and Mr. Biden’s onetime rival for the Democratic nomination, is the first woman of color on a major party ticket. Ms. Harris, who is known as a pragmatic and moderate Democrat, made the urgency of defeating President Trump a centerpiece of her run. She has been a strong voice on issues of police misconduct, but she has struggled on occasion to reconcile her calls for reform with her record as a prosecutor. As a Californian, Ms. Harris is not bringing battleground state credentials to the ticket. But she is bringing appeal to Black voters and women, her supporters argued during Mr. Biden’s search for a running mate. So how is the Biden-Harris ticket going to work? How will Ms. Harris appeal to swing voters — or to the voters who are swinging between voting Democratic or staying home? And how might she make her pitch next week, at the Democratic National Convention, virtual edition? There’s a lot to discuss, and Times reporters are on top of all of it. Reporters Alexander Burns, Nick Corasaniti, Astead Herndon and Patricia Mazzei talked about the Harris pick, battleground states and took your questions in a conversation hosted by the editor Rachel Dry.
