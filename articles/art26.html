Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Tuesday. Weather: Occasional drizzle, but glimpses of sun. High in the low 70s. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Nov. 1 (All Saints Day). If you haven’t already, now might be a good time to finally get your hands on a reusable shopping bag. This week, New York is finally enforcing its statewide ban on single-use plastic bags. The law actually went into effect last winter, but the pandemic and a lawsuit from plastic bag manufacturers delayed enforcement for months. Now, shops must avoid these bags or face fines up to $500. Exceptions here and there mean that plastic bags won’t completely vanish, but it will certainly be harder to find the once-everyday objects. Here’s what else you need to know: The Bag Waste Reduction Law, passed after the Democrats took control of both houses of the Legislature in 2019, was part of an effort to curb litter and minimize greenhouse emissions caused by plastic bag production. By one estimate, New Yorkers were using about 23 billion plastic bags each year, 85 percent of which ended up in landfills, recycling machines (although they are not recyclable in most machines), waterways and streets. New York was the second state to agree to impose such a ban, after California. At least six other states followed suit, including Vermont and Connecticut. New Jersey last month passed a bill to ban both plastic and paper single-use bags. In February, the Bodega and Small Business Association sued the state, arguing that the ban was unconstitutional and vague. The lawsuit and enforcement of the ban then were in limbo because courts were short-staffed during the height of the pandemic in New York. In August, the State Supreme Court struck down the lawsuit, and the state Department of Environmental Conservation later announced enforcement would begin in October. Restaurants can still give out single-use plastic bags for takeout. Stores can use them for items including uncooked meat, sliced or prepared food, and prescription drugs. Newspaper bags, garment bags and bags sold in bulk, such as trash or recycling bags, are also exempt from the rule. If you don’t take a reusable bag to a store, paper bags will likely be available for a 5-cent fee. People who are purchasing items using food stamps are exempt from paying the paper-bag fee. The revenue from that fee will go to the state’s Environmental Protection Fund and programs that distribute reusable bags. Bodega workers were adjusting to the rule on Monday, turning down some requests for single-use plastic bags.
