By Carole Landry and Hiroko Masuike (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. Fires in California have forced more than 119,000 people from their homes. Firefighters are struggling to get a handle on the 560 wildfires burning throughout the state, scorching more than 900,000 acres, including a treasured redwood forest. The smoke has reached Nebraska. Above, Healdsburg, in wine country. About a dozen major fires continue to grow, particularly in the north, where two groupings are now among the largest in state history. More dry thunderstorms could make things worse. Gov. Gavin Newsom said he was receiving help even from the East Coast and Australia. Why does California have so many wildfires? There are four drivers; climate change figures prominently. Tropical Storms Marco and Laura are churning in the Caribbean, prompting a wave of warnings and watches. The governor of Louisiana has declared a state of emergency. Have you been keeping up with the headlines? Test your knowledge with our news quiz.

Most of the events for the Republican National Convention will be online, but the kickoff on Monday will feature an in-person roll call in Charlotte, N.C., to nominate President Trump to lead the country for another four years. Mr. Trump will be there to thank the delegates, and he will accept the nomination from the White House on Thursday. He has weighed in on much of the programming himself, and is speaking every night in the 10 o’clock hour.Here’s what to watch for. On Saturday night, The Washington Post published a series of audio recordings of Mr. Trump’s sister Maryanne Trump Barry in which she describes him as a liar who has “no principles.” The tapes were made in 2018 and 2019 by her niece, Mary Trump, who provided them to The Post. 3. The Biden-Harris ticket. The Democratic convention last week showcased a theme that Joe Biden, from the beginning of his campaign to his formal arrival as the Democrats’ presidential candidate, has never wavered from: that President Trump is a danger to American democracy. That’s paying off in polling. But the uncertainty around the election caused by the coronavirus crisis, Mr. Trump’s stated intent to undermine voting by mail and the country’s polarization leave plenty of room for suspense. So do the fall debates. The Biden-Harris message will be tested against one of the most negative campaigns since the first President George Bush defeated Michael Dukakis in 1988, a race some Republicans are looking back to as a beacon of hope. 4. Congress is seized with the fight over the post office. In a rare weekend session that interrupted the summer recess, the House passed a measure to protect the Postal Service’s budget and its ability to pay overtime. But the bill appeared unlikely to move through the Republican-controlled Senate. And the White House has vowed a veto. Above, a demonstrator in Jersey City, N.J., last week. Louis DeJoy, the postmaster general, testified before a Senate panel on Friday that the cost-cutting and other changes on his watch had nothing to do with the election. He is to testify on Monday before a House committee whose members have expressed interest in his appointment by President Trump, the changes he’s tried to enact and the involvement of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. 5. Some schools are keeping quiet about coronavirus infections. In areas where schools are open and the pandemic is still raging, some districts have issued weekly, sometimes daily, reports. But other districts have been silent, to the dismay of anxious parents, teachers and health workers. Case in point: the above school’s district in Kingsland, Ga.
