Kessel WASHINGTON — When the publication of a dossier of unproven rumors about Donald J. Trump and Russia rocked American politics in early 2017, one salacious claim jumped out: Russia intelligence services supposedly had a video showing Mr. Trump cavorting with prostitutes in Moscow’s Ritz-Carlton hotel. Mr. Trump denied it all, no evidence emerged supporting the existence of any tape, and other claims in the so-called Steele dossier were disproved. But talk of a purported tape became a lingering touchstone of an era awash in conspiracy theories and misinformation — tantalizing Mr. Trump’s critics and enraging his supporters. The claim came from Igor Danchenko, a Russia analyst who gathered leads about possible Trump-Russia links for what turned out to be Democratic-funded opposition research. In an interview, Mr. Danchenko described hearing rumors from two sources about a possible sex tape involving Mr. Trump and the Ritz-Carlton, then obtaining more nebulous information from two hotel employees he took as corroborative. Acknowledging that the material was too thin to amount to proof and saying that he himself remained skeptical, Mr. Danchenko defended the integrity of his work. He said he was assigned simply to gather “raw intelligence” for his employer, Christopher Steele, and passed along claims that raised a potential “red flag.” He noted that he was not responsible for how Mr. Steele portrayed that information in the dossier, nor for making it public. “Even raw intelligence from credible sources, I take it with a grain of salt,” Mr. Danchenko said. “Who knows, what if it’s not particularly accurate? Is it just a rumor or is there more to it?” Mr. Danchenko said he wanted to clear his name after his identity was revealed in July. Threats and harassment followed, he said, escalating when Attorney General William P. Barr declassified the fact that Mr. Danchenko was himself scrutinized in a counterintelligence investigation a decade ago. The F.B.I. closed it in 2011 without charging him, but Mr. Trump’s allies, like Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, began calling him a “Russian agent.” Mr. Danchenko — who made his name as a Russia analyst by exposing indications that the dissertation of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia contained plagiarized material — accused the senator of smearing him.
