By Michael D. Shear, Katie Glueck, Maggie Haberman and Thomas Kaplan WILMINGTON, Del. — President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. named Ron Klain, a veteran Democratic operative and a decades-long confidant, to be his White House chief of staff Wednesday evening, the first step toward putting in place his administration’s senior leadership. Mr. Klain, a lawyer with deep experience on Capitol Hill, with advising President Barack Obama and in corporate board rooms, served as Mr. Biden’s chief of staff when he was vice president and has been seen for months as the likeliest choice to manage his team in the White House. Known for steady nerves, he also has a fierce wit, which he has frequently unleashed on President Trump on Twitter. He was particularly critical of Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, having served as the “Ebola czar” under Mr. Obama during an outbreak of the deadly disease in his second term. A video of Mr. Klain lecturing Mr. Trump about the pandemic was widely seen during the campaign. In a statement, Mr. Biden called Mr. Klain an “invaluable” adviser, noting in particular the work they did together during the economic crisis in 2009 and the Ebola outbreak in 2014. “His deep, varied experience and capacity to work with people all across the political spectrum is precisely what I need in a White House chief of staff as we confront this moment of crisis and bring our country together again,” Mr. Biden said. The choice of Mr. Klain, 59, who first went to work for Mr. Biden in the late 1980s when Mr. Biden was a senator from Delaware and Mr. Klain was a recent graduate of Harvard Law School, signals that Mr. Biden intends to rely on a tight circle of Washington insiders who have been by his side for years. Advisers have said that the president-elect will announce other top White House staff in the coming days, even as Mr. Trump refuses to accept the results of the election, tweeting “WE WILL WIN!” on Wednesday evening. Mr. Biden is not likely to reveal his cabinet picks until around Thanksgiving, several people close to the transition said. As a political tactician, Mr. Klain is well versed in the levers of power in both the executive and legislative branches of government. But he will quickly come under pressure to assemble a White House staff that extends beyond the moderate members of the Democratic establishment with whom Mr. Biden has surrounded himself over four decades in politics. Even before Mr. Biden’s announcement, liberals in the party had already begun demanding that progressives be given a significant voice in the West Wing. And the president-elect will also be pressed to fulfill his campaign pledge to make his administration “look like the country” by tapping people of color, L.G.B.T.Q. Americans and other minorities to be part of the White House staff. In a statement, Mr. Klain said he looked forward to assembling “a talented and diverse team to work in the White House as we tackle their ambitious agenda for change and seek to heal the divides in our country.” Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of Mr. Biden’s liberal rivals for the presidential nomination, praised Mr. Klain on Twitter, calling him “a superb choice” and saying that he “understands the magnitude of the health and economic crisis and he has the experience to lead this next administration through it.” Mr. Biden made his choice of Mr. Klain even as Mr. Trump remained defiant in the face of political reality, refusing to concede defeat and insisting that the presidential election was stolen from him four days after news organizations projected that Mr. Biden had secured the electoral votes necessary to win. Mr. Trump and his allies — including most Republicans on Capitol Hill — have falsely claimed that the election was tainted by fraudulently cast ballots and a conspiracy by Democrats, poll workers and the news media. The president’s lawyers have filed lawsuits in several states and his operatives are scouring for examples of fraud even as Democratic and Republican election officials in nearly all 50 states say the election was fair. In the meantime, Mr. Biden is moving quickly to demonstrate that the president’s unprecedented behavior will not interfere with the transfer of power that will take place on Jan. 20. Mr. Klain clerked for Justice Byron R. White at the Supreme Court in the late 1980s and has been a fixture by Mr. Biden’s side for much of the past 30 years, serving at one point as the chief counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Mr. Biden led. Mr. Klain was Mr. Biden’s top legal adviser on the committee during the racially charged and sexually explicit collision with the Bush administration over the confirmation of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. Many of Mr. Biden’s allies saw his handling of the confirmation — managed in large part by Mr. Klain and his team of committee lawyers — as one of the stains on his record in the Senate. Mr. Klain took a detour to serve as Al Gore’s chief of staff while he was vice president and later oversaw Mr. Gore’s unsuccessful recount effort in Florida (for which he was portrayed by Kevin Spacey in the HBO film “Recount”). But Mr. Klain has always remained close to Mr. Biden. In 2009, he became the vice president’s chief of staff, reprising the role he had played a decade earlier for Mr. Gore. Mr. Klain’s experience confronting the Ebola outbreak during the Obama administration was newly relevant this year as the coronavirus pandemic upended American life and became Mr. Biden’s central message during the presidential race. The Biden campaign leaned on Mr. Klain’s expertise as it drew a contrast between the way Mr. Biden would approach the pandemic and the way Mr. Trump did. In March, the campaign released a video of Mr. Klain speaking in front of a white board comparing the two approaches that has been viewed more than four million times on Twitter. A sequel, again featuring Mr. Klain in front of a white board, was posted in July. In the last few weeks of the campaign, Mr. Trump sought to use Mr. Klain’s own words against him with a video in which Mr. Klain appears to admit that the Obama administration “did every possible thing wrong” during an outbreak of the H1N1 swine flu virus. Fact checkers concluded that Mr. Klain was speaking only about the reliance on a single vaccine, and was taken out of context. Mr. Klain has gone in and out of government over the past several decades, at times practicing as a lawyer and later working with Steve Case, the founder of AOL, in a venture capital investment firm called Revolution. His initial agreement with Mr. Case in 2005 included the right to take unpaid leave in September and October every four years to participate in presidential politics.
