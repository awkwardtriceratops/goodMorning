Letizia, now 16, and most of her friends used its exfoliating face scrub that smells like apricots and sloughs off the topmost layers of skin with ground walnut shells. As recently as February, St. Ives face masks and face washes were a part of her skin care regimen. A month later she found Hyram Yarbro and threw it all out. Mr. Yarbro, the purple-haired creator of Skincare by Hyram, a YouTube channel turned TikTok account, has captivated teenagers like Ms. Timoni during the pandemic with pointed product reviews, ingredient tutorials and quippy videos reacting to skin care routines of celebrities and influencers like Bella Thorne, Skai Jackson and Madison Beer. For the record, Mr. Yarbro, 24, does not approve of any of their skin care routines.
