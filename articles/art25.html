By Jonathan Abrams Years ago in the early 1990s, Willy T. Ribbs, the first Black man to compete in the Indianapolis 500, sought a deep-pocketed partner, a heavy breather, as he calls them, to help catapult him into the victory lane. Ribbs had already aligned with Bill Cosby, long before his fall from grace. But he hoped to secure added financial backing from Michael Jordan, then at the height of his playing prowess. “He had N.B.A. championships on his mind,” said Ribbs, who also drove in a few NASCAR races. “I totally understood. He was firmly focused on winning championships. Plus, he was young then. When he declined, I truly understood that. But now? He’s laying out by the pool at the La Palapa.” No longer. This week, Jordan announced that he is joining Denny Hamlin, one of the most lauded drivers in the sport, to form a NASCAR team with Darrell “Bubba” Wallace Jr., the lone Black driver on NASCAR’s top level. It will begin competition in the 2021 season. The pairing of Jordan and Wallace is significant in a sport that historically lacks minority representation and has struggled to expand and diversify its largely white fan base. With the move, Jordan, who is also the owner of the N.B.A.’s Charlotte Hornets, becomes the first African-American majority owner in NASCAR since the pioneer Wendell Scott raced during the 1960s Civil Rights era. “A lot of what I call closet NASCAR fans are Black fans,” said Bill Lester, who for years was the only African-American driver in NASCAR’s top series. “Now with Jordan opening the door to the sport, I think that that’s going to go a long way.” “But it’ll just be a blip on the radar,’’ he added, “unless the team can win. If the team can win, then that’s going to really kick the door down. It’ll be kind of like the phenomena of what Venus and Serena have done for tennis and what Tiger’s done for golf.” Jordan called himself a lifetime NASCAR fan in a statement announcing the formation and said that his parents routinely took his family to races during his childhood in North Carolina. Brad Daugherty, a former N.B.A. player and Jordan’s college teammate at the University of North Carolina, is a partner at JTG Daugherty Racing. “The timing seemed perfect as NASCAR is evolving and embracing social change more and more,” Jordan said in the statement, adding: “I see this as a chance to educate a new audience and open more opportunities for Black people in racing.” That is the vision that Warrick Scott thought of when he learned that Jordan is entering NASCAR ownership. Scott is the grandson of Wendell Scott, who died in 1990 and was the first Black driver to win a race at NASCAR’s premier level. “One thing I can tell you from going to racetracks, people already wear Jordans to the races,” Warrick Scott said. Often, he said, Black and other nonwhite people are never exposed to the racetrack. “That’s the driving force behind what we do by using my grandfather’s legacy to provide critical access to all of the dopeness that exists within the sport of NASCAR,” Warrick Scott said. “There’s also a lot of great jobs within that sport. Hopefully, the Jordan Brand, because it’s an enterprise, will help provide other opportunities in those lanes as well.” Wallace ignited the sport’s confrontation with its divisive past this summer as the country reeled from protests over systemic racism and police brutality.
