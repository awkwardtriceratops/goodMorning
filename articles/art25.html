John Katko, a moderate Republican, defeated Dana Balter in a Central New York district where Democrats outnumber Republicans. By Luis Ferré-Sadurní Representative John M. Katko, a moderate Republican who has defied the nation’s partisan drift by holding on to a seat in a Democratic-leaning district in Central New York, won his bid for a fourth term. His challenger, Dana Balter, a Democratic activist and former Syracuse University professor who also lost to Mr. Katko two years ago, conceded on Friday, acknowledging that the absentee ballots yet to be counted were unlikely to allow her to overcome his lead.
