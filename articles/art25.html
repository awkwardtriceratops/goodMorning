By Victoria Shannon and Sandra Stevenson (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President-elect Joe Biden is expected to nominate Janet Yellen, the first woman to lead to the Federal Reserve, as Treasury secretary. If confirmed, Ms. Yellen would also be the first woman to lead the Treasury in its 231-year history. As one of the most recognizable figures in Washington’s economic spheres, Ms. Yellen would  most likely bring with her a preference for government help for struggling households and for slightly tighter financial regulation. Mr. Biden also plans to name several top national security picks on Tuesday, including the first Latino to lead the Department of Homeland Security, the first woman to head the intelligence community and a former secretary of state, John Kerry, to be his international climate czar, a cabinet-level position. 2. Michigan’s electoral board certified its presidential vote tally, paving the way for President-elect Joe Biden to receive the state’s 16 electoral votes. Resisting pressure from President Trump to delay the process, the board’s approval officially delivers to Mr. Biden a key battleground that Mr. Trump had wrested away from Democrats four years ago, and rebuffs the president’s legal and political efforts to overturn the results with false claims of voter fraud. Above, a protest in Lansing, Mich., today. In Pennsylvania, counties are individually certifying results. Philadelphia is planning to vote tonight after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in a case involving roughly 8,000 ballots that had signatures but problems with the date or address. We are tracking the states that have certified their election results, and here is our timeline of state deadlines. 3. The safest refuge for some Republicans struggling to cope with election reality has been to say they are waiting out the results of court cases. But that defense is weakening as President Trump’s legal effort collapses. “At some point,” said Senator Shelly Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, “the 2020 election must end.” More than 100 prominent national security experts who are Republicans or served in Republican administrations implored G.O.P. members of Congress to demand that Mr. Trump concede the election, saying that his refusal to do so risked the nation’s security. At the same time, 160-plus top American executives asked the administration to begin the transfer of power. And G.M. said it would no longer back the White House’s lawsuit to nullify California’s fuel economy rules, signaling that corporate America is ready to work with a new administration. 4. The world could be on its way to three working coronavirus vaccines to help curb the pandemic. The British-Swiss drugmaker AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford said an early analysis of late-stage clinical trials showed that their inexpensive and easy-to-produce vaccine appeared to be effective. Pfizer and Moderna have both said that their vaccines were about 95 percent effective in advanced testing. Above, the labs used in Oxford. In other vaccine developments: Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, is behind a vaccine initiative to help protect poor nations from the coronavirus. The success of the effort is not at all certain. The Ad Council, which led a polio vaccine campaign in the 1950s, is working on a $50 million advertising blitz to persuade skeptical Americans to immunize themselves once vaccines are ready.
