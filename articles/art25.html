By David Leonhardt Want to get The Morning by email? Here’s the sign-up. I’m happy to be back in your inboxes after an August break. And I’m grateful to my colleagues who did such a nice job filling in. Now let’s dive into the 2020 campaign … The final months of a presidential campaign are dominated by a few showcase events: the choice of a vice-presidential nominee (or two), the back-to-back conventions and the debates. Political pundits frequently describe all of them as crucial to the outcome. But the truth is that only one has a track record of affecting polls in a big way: the conventions. Political conventions have sometimes created large enough swings to allow a trailing candidate — like President Trump this year — to make a comeback. Convention season was important to George Bush’s win in 1988, Bill Clinton’s in 1992 and George W. Bush’s in 2004. (This short book, by the political scientists Robert Erikson and Christopher Wlezien, has an excellent summary.) The main reason is that many Americans don’t follow politics very closely. That’s especially true of swing voters. And the conventions are two giant political infomercials, with television networks handing over hours of broadcast time to the Democratic and Republican parties. The conventions are when many people tune into the campaign for the first time. It’s true that the post-convention polling bounces have shrunk in recent years, as polarization has increased and the number of undecided voters has decreased. This year’s virtual conventions, which lack some of the energy of a normal event, may also have a smaller impact. Even so, this week is an important one. It’s one of Trump’s few clear opportunities to change the direction of the 2020 campaign. He and his fellow Republicans will probably have a stronger hold on the country’s attention over the next four days than at any other stretch until Election Day. How will Republicans use the opportunity? For one thing, they will conduct more of the event live. Trump has described recorded speeches — which the Democrats used extensively — as “pretty boring.” He plans to speak himself all four nights. As for the substance, Republicans will try to rebut the Democrats’ criticisms of Trump’s presidency by describing the strength of the pre-pandemic economy and claiming that Trump has done a good job fighting the coronavirus. (That latter claim is largely false, especially when compared with every other rich country in the world.) But the convention’s central message will probably be more negative than positive — casting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as unfit for office. The goal will be to persuade voters to stop focusing on the virus, the economic downturn and Trump’s performance as president. His campaign will instead try to make the alternative seem worse than the incumbent. “The Trump strategy is brutally simple: change the focus from firing Trump to fearing Biden and Harris,” as Mike Murphy, an anti-Trump Republican strategist, wrote in a recent Washington Post op-ed titled, “How Biden Could Still Lose.” The journalist Susan Page, speaking on Fox News Sunday, put it this way: “Bringing down Joe Biden as either someone who’s weak or someone who is a captive of the party’s left wing, that is the task, I think, that Republicans face over the next four days.” Next week, when post-convention polls start appearing, we will get a sense for whether either of this year’s conventions changed the campaign.
