By Mihir Zaveri Transportation officials in New York City first began seeing broken windows on subway cars, mostly on the 2, 3 and 7 lines, in April. On one day in mid-July, nearly 50 windows across three 7 trains were smashed. Then this week, the problem seemed to have intensified again: about 60 windows on several 7 trains were found shattered with what officials said was a “blunt instrument.” Vandalized subway trains have in the past been associated with a period of financial hardship in New York City that was marked by increased violence and crime. Now, the spate of smashed windows has presented transit officials with a worrisome crime trend, as both the city and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority face staggering economic challenges because of the coronavirus pandemic. The authority, which runs the city’s subway, buses and two commuter rails, has braced for possible steep cuts to staffing and service as it faces a $16 billion deficit. Overall, the damage from the smashed windows this year has totaled about $300,000, said Patrick Warren, the chief safety and security officer of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. That is double the amount the agency had allocated for such repairs through late August, said Tim Minton, a spokesman for the authority. “We’re not exactly flush with cash right now,” said Mr. Warren, who is also acting chief operating officer of New York City Transit. “Every dollar matters.” It was not clear if one person or several people were involved in the damage to the train car windows. Earlier this month, the Police Department said they were looking for a man in connection with dozens of separate incidents between May and August.
