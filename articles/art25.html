Ten hours after it struck, rescue workers were still pulling people from rubble in the Turkish city of Izmir. By Megan Specia and Matina Stevis-Gridneff Rescue workers scrambled into the early morning Saturday in a frantic effort to save people trapped under debris in the western Turkish city of Izmir, several hours after a major earthquake in the Aegean Sea leveled several buildings and severely damaged many more. At least 20 people were killed in Turkey and hundreds were reported injured, officials said. Another two people were killed in Greece from the earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.0 according to the United States Geological Survey, and was centered off Samos, a Greek island near Turkey’s coast. More than 1,200 workers were involved in rescue efforts involving at least 13 buildings in Izmir, the country’s third-most populous city with about three million people. Images posted to social media and videos aired on state television showed people being pulled from the rubble into the embrace of loved ones. Nearly 10 hours after the quake struck, three people were rescued from the rubble of an eight-story building, Turkish television reported, showing dramatic footage of one being pulled from the debris. The quake struck just before 3 p.m. on Friday, causing panicked residents of Izmir to dash into the street, many of them wearing face masks because of the coronavirus pandemic. Video showed tremors lasting 35 seconds or more. In Greece, two teenagers died in Samos when a wall collapsed on them, state news reported. The quake rattled several parts of Greece and was felt in Istanbul, about 200 miles northeast of Izmir. But much of the damage appeared to be in the city of Izmir, a center for tourism and industry that is prone to earthquakes. One young man was pulled from the debris of a fallen building and was quickly reunited with his mother. “My three children were at home. I was not,” she told Haber Turk Television. “They are all fine, survived.”
