By Christopher Clarey The French Open women’s tournament, already a spinning roulette wheel of upsets and unlikely success stories, got its first genuine shock on Sunday when unseeded Polish youngster Iga Swiatek upset No. 1 seed Simona Halep 6-1, 6-2 in the fourth round. Swiatek, 19, won only one game against Halep in the same round and on the same Philippe Chatrier Court last year, losing in just 45 minutes. But she was the dominant force on the red clay on Sunday, dictating terms with her whipping forehand and heavy serve and forcing Halep to lunge repeatedly to keep pace. “Even I am surprised that I can do that,” Swiatek said after closing out the victory and burying her head in a towel in her courtside seat. It was quite a day for 19-year-olds at this chilly Roland Garros. But then Jannik Sinner should feel right in his element. He was a competitive ski racer before choosing to chase big tennis dreams, and he coolly eliminated No. 6 seed Alexander Zverev 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. Sinner, a redheaded Italian, is the first man since Rafael Nadal in 2005 to reach the quarterfinals while playing in his first French Open. Guess who Sinner faces next? “I practiced with him a couple of times,” said Nadal, who will play Sinner on Tuesday. “He has an amazing potential. He moves the hand very quick, and he’s able to produce some amazing shots.” Nadal, a 12-time French Open champion, had no trouble with another member of Sinner’s generation: 20-year-old American qualifier Sebastian Korda. Nadal won 6-1, 6-1, 6-2 against Korda, the son of former French Open finalist Petr Korda and former WTA Tour player Regina Rajchrtova. Sebastian Korda, a Nadal fan, had to settle for the consolation of getting Nadal’s autograph after the match. But Dominic Thiem, the No. 3 seed and new United States Open champion, came much closer to defeat against Hugo Gaston, a 20-year-old French wild card who had upset Stan Wawrinka in the third round. After losing the first two sets to Thiem, the 5-foot-8 Gaston destabilized the powerful Austrian with his artful blend of drop shots, lobs and short-hop returns. But the drop-shot magic eventually ran out, and Thiem prevailed by summoning some huge forehand inside-out winners when he needed them most. His 6-4, 6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 6-3 victory earned him a quarterfinal against No. 12 seed Diego Schwartzman, another relatively short player with big talent. Schwartzman, a 5-foot-7 Argentine, upset Nadal in the Italian Open on clay last month and defeated Lorenzo Sonego of Italy 6-1, 6-3, 6-4 on Sunday. For now, the three leading contenders for the men’s title — Nadal, Thiem and No. 1 Novak Djokovic — are still in contention. But the women’s draw is a smoldering Paris ruin. Halep’s defeat was one of the most lopsided and unexpected of ts her career. She had won 17 straight matches in the disrupted 2020 season and 13 straight on clay. She skipped the U.S. Open because of concerns about traveling during the coronavirus pandemic, and trained almost exclusively on clay in Romania during the hiatus. She returned after a six-month break to win titles on the surface at the Prague Open and Italian Open. Halep appeared to be in high spirits and rare form and headed for another title run, but she ended up losing to another teen instead. . “All credit to her,” Halep said. “She played unbelievable today.” Less than an hour after Halep’s defeat under a closed roof at Philippe Chatrier Court, Martina Trevisan, an Italian qualifier, upset No. 5 seed Kiki Bertens 6-4, 6-4. Trevisan, ranked 159, already had defeated American teenager Coco Gauff and No. 20 seed Maria Sakkari in the tournament. She finished in style against Bertens, whose best surface is clay, whipping a backhand topspin lob winner that landed on the baseline. “I’m living a dream, it’s true,” said Trevisan. So is Nadia Podoroska of Argentina, another qualifier ranked outside the top 100 who is into the quarterfinals: the first time two qualifiers have advanced this far at Roland Garros since 1978. This French Open, postponed from its traditional dates in May and June because of the health crisis, was missing key women’s players from the start. Ashleigh Barty, last year’s singles champion who is still ranked No. 1, is riding out the pandemic at home in Brisbane, Australia. Naomi Osaka, who won the United States Open last month, withdrew from Roland Garros, explaining that the tight, two-week gap did not leave her enough time to recover from a hamstring injury. But after eight days, the women’s tournament is now missing most of its stars, including Serena Williams, who withdrew with an Achilles’ tendon injury before the second round. Halep’s defeat guaranteed a first-time French Open women’s champion and left No. 3 seed Elina Svitolina as the top remaining women’s seed, who will face Podoroska next. Only four of the 32 seeds remain in the draw: Svitolina, No. 4 Sofia Kenin, No. 7 Petra Kvitova and No. 30 Ons Jabeur. “At this level nobody surprises anybody anymore because everyone has a big level and it depends on the day,” Halep said. Not one quarterfinalist from this year’s U.S. Open is still in contention. Trevisan, 26, could not have made an equivalent run at the U.S. Open, which did not stage a qualifying tournament this year in order to limit the number of players on site during the pandemic. Swiatek spent the tour hiatus at home in Poland finishing her high school degree. Her father, Tomasz, was an Olympic rower who competed for Poland at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul. Their last name is regularly mispronounced on the women’s tennis circuit; she politely suggests Shvee-ON-tek. But she certainly made a name for herself on Sunday. Swiatek, the 2018 Wimbledon junior champion, would have fit right in at the All England Club in her all-white outfit. She played high-risk, acute-angle tennis from the start and finished with 30 winners and 20 unforced errors. But she also kept Halep off balance with guile and touch: mixing in drop shots and forays to the net, and responding to some of Halep’s fine passing shots by hitting spectacular volley winners. She struck quickly with her heavy forehand but also had the patience to prevail in Halep’s usual domain: the extended rally. It was all quite a contrast with her lopsided loss to Halep on the same court in 2019. She was the steamroller this time: winning in just an hour and eight minutes. “Right now I’m more experienced; I can handle the pressure,” she said. “I feel like I’ve grown up to play a match like that and to win it.” After losing in the 2014 and 2017 French Open finals, Halep won her first major title at the 2018 French Open and followed that up by defeating Williams in brilliant fashion to win Wimbledon in 2019. Though she could certainly have played and adjusted better on Sunday — she often failed to hit her shots deep enough to keep Swiatek from attacking and missed some key openings down the stretch — Halep was far from a nervous wreck. Above all, the 54th-ranked Swiatek rose to the big occasion: competing with genuine swagger and never allowing Halep, one of the game’s best returners, the luxury of a break point. “It’s really nice that we have many young players that are coming up and that are not scared,” Swiatek said. “I’m really happy that I’m one of them, and I hope I’m going to continue that way.” Next up at this most unusual French Open: a most unlikely quarterfinal with Trevisan. “.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
