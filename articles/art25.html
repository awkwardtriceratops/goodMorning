There Was an Easier Explanation.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Twenty-one inmates in the San Mateo County, Calif., jail filed for pandemic unemployment assistance, resulting in payments of at least $250,000, according to the district attorney. By Marie Fazio Like millions of others across California, more than 20 people living together in San Mateo filed for pandemic unemployment assistance recently, claiming the coronavirus had put them out of work. But according to the authorities, there was a different reason these people were unemployed: They were in the San Mateo Maguire Correctional Facility. Over the weekend, 21 people in San Mateo, Calif., were charged with filing fraudulent pandemic unemployment assistance claims while in jail. The claims resulted in total payments of more than $250,000, according to the authorities. The felony charges they face — various counts of conspiracy to commit fraud — each carry a maximum penalty of thee years in prison. Those charged applied and began receiving assistance while they were in custody, meaning the claims violated California’s unemployment laws, said Stephen M. Wagstaffe, the San Mateo County district attorney. A person who received assistance before arrest is permitted to continue to do so, he noted. Deemed a “large-scale pandemic unemployment assistance fraud ring” by the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office, the scheme operated out of the San Mateo Maguire Correctional Facility, according to a news release. The scheme was simple, Mr. Wagstaffe said. “Somebody, either in March or early April, said, ‘Hey we can put in for this and get some free money,’” he said. “Fairly soon after that point, the money was flowing.” Inmates filed unemployment claims — some using county-issued iPads provided in jail — with the California Employment Development Department. Others provided personal information in phone calls to people on the outside who filed for unemployment on their behalf, a spokeswoman for the Sheriff’s Department said, adding that iPads and phones in the jail are “heavily regulated.” The money was then deposited into a bank account of their choosing. Friends or family members withdrew the cash for some, while others did it themselves after they were released, Mr. Wagstaffe said. In some cases, the money was spent on “remarkable personal items” including expensive clothing and a trip to Las Vegas, he said. The authorities traced 16 fraudulent claims using more than 30 inmates’ names to 21 people, about half of whom were still in jail, according to the district attorney. “We’re probably going to find many, many more,” Mr. Wagstaffe said. “We think it had at least been going on since fairly soon after the crisis set in, which in California would be March.” The authorities were tipped off to the operation when an investigator with the district attorney’s office who was listening to recorded jail phone calls for a separate case overheard an inmate bragging about “free money put into their accounts,” Mr. Wagstaffe said. Updated August 17, 2020 “It was a lucky break,” he said, referring to the discovery. Mr. Wagstaffe said his office had notified prosecutors’ and sheriffs’ offices across California because inmates often get transferred within the system and word about the scheme could have spread. One of the people charged over the weekend had been convicted of murder in San Mateo County and transferred to a state prison, Mr. Wagstaffe said. “Heaven knows,” the district attorney added, “he’s probably told hundreds upon hundreds of people there about this wonderful easy scam that nobody’s catching — until now.” About half of those charged were still at the Maguire Correctional Facility or California Department of Corrections when they were charged on Saturday, Mr. Wagstaffe said. The others, who are accused of participating in the fraud while they were inmates but had since been released, were arrested in three counties, according to the Sheriff’s Department, and $150,000 cash was recovered after search warrants were served. Pandemic unemployment assistance is intended to help those who are unemployed or underemployed as a result of the coronavirus. According to the California Employment Development Department’s website, the program pays $40 to $450 per week and previously an additional $600 weekly from the federal government. The Employment Development Department did not immediately respond to inquiries on Monday about the investigation into the scheme. “I think we’re just at the beginning of finding out the extent of fraud,” Mr. Wagstaffe said. “I can’t believe that California is unique. In the end, how much fraud occurred by prisoners who were locked up?” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
