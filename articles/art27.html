You Don’t Want to Know<br></h1><p id="artcont">From gerrymandering to voter roll purges, we showed people around the world how the American system works. It didn’t go well. Video by Chai Dingari, Brendan Miller, Adam Westbrook and Emily Holzknecht TRANSCRIPT All right, let’s have a look here. “New Mexico is 49th in unemployment and 50th for schools. We got to bust through some walls to make changes.” [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] “— is to rebuild our infrastructure. And here’s what I think of Trump’s wall.” So awkward. Please play me more. What? Are you kidding me? It is chaotic. It’s crazy. It’s like you want to stop people from voting. This is, it’s stupid. Ugh. I’m done. I’m done. That looks like an ink blot test. This looks like a toilet to me. It looks like a Jackson Pollock. That’s straight-up Jackson Pollock. How do you pronounce that? I don’t even know what that is. Gerrymandering? “Gerrymandering. The art of drawing districts to put as many of your voters together or more often, to make sure the other party’s voters are broken up and scattered.” Well, now when you tell me what gerrymandering is then this sounds like cheating. That’s illegal. I’m sorry, firstly, gerrymandering needs to be illegal. In Australia, redistricting is done by an independent commission, not done by the politicians who won those districts, so it is a lot fairer. “If you haven’t registered to vote, time is running out.” “With registration deadlines as far as 30 days before the election.” What is voter registration? I mean, I know what it is, but I understand, why do you have this kind of thing? In Germany, you don’t need to register yourself for the vote. In Estonia, voter registration is automatic. I actually had somebody who is an election officer come over to my house and help me out with my process of voter registration, and mind you, this is in a country of 1.3 billion people. ”Voter purging is the process by which election officials remove names from the voter rolls.” Come on. No one thinks of a word “purge” and thinks of anything positive. We have seen the “Purge” films. Georgia likely removed nearly 200,000 from voter rolls wrongfully? How? I can’t imagine for this to happen in Germany. Nope, you don’t get to vote. Nope, you don’t get to vote either. Nope. “Voting in America is on a Tuesday. Many people don’t vote, because they are either too busy or have conflicting work or school schedules.” To me, it sounds like 19th century to be honest. What I really appreciate about Germany is it’s so easy for you to go and vote. It’s on a Sunday. It’s on a free day. In India, it’s actually illegal to keep your employees from voting. So in Australia, we have this thing called a “democracy sausage.” You take a selfie with your democracy sausage. You haven’t voted in Australia unless you’ve gotten your democracy sausage. In the last Estonian parliamentary elections, I think I cast my vote during breakfast. I have this identity card. I insert it into a computer reader, pick my candidate, and cast my vote. It took me two minutes. Approximately a minute. Five minutes. Five to seven minutes. Five to 10. Ten minutes. ”Seven hours, 45 minutes, and 13 seconds it took for me.” Wait, wait, wait, it took him the amount of time it will take for me to fly from the U.K., from London to New York. This feels like the opposite of easy to vote. This is not acceptable. It’s just not acceptable in a democratic country, I think. I’ll say 80 percent, just because they’ve haven’t been doing too well recently with everything else. 64 percent. Yeah, that’s not good. That’s almost half of the Americans have no voice. It’s like you want to stop people from voting. Why is that so? ”Somebody please help us. We are at our polling place in Atlanta, Fickett Elementary School. The systems are down.” “Oh look, there’s no line. There’s no line at all, out here in suburban white country.” That’s, for real that’s the reason? Oh. That is the definition of racism. It’s the same in South Africa. If you want to go into a wealthy white community, everything is easy. If you want to go to the township, I don’t even know if you’re going to get to vote. “Moms and dads took their kids, you know, to vote with them doing the civil rights era. How I get to do that now? How I get to take my family with me, and I can go vote with family for the first time, and that means a lot to me.” I think this is the sign of the resilience. That I think is what will protect democracy, if nothing else. But that American spirit, you have to love it. You know, people are still going out there and standing in the queues and standing in the rain. As weird as it sounds, the only way to overcome this is to vote. Fight to vote and then change the system by voting. I will never get up on American life. If people keep the same spirit, keep the same energy, then undoubtedly, a “change is gonna come.” I think Americans should have a democracy sausage. Sure, call it a democracy hot dog if you want to. It tastes like freedom. Tastes like representative power. Turnout this election is projected to be the highest in a century, and voters are doing everything they can to make their voices count. Waiting in line for hours (even if you’re the mayor). Voting in person despite the pandemic because you fear that your mail-in ballot could be one of the 1.02 million that might be discarded. And casting a ballot despite the potential that someone with a semiautomatic rifle will be watching you at your polling place. But, does voting have to be so … hard? Not really. Just watch the video above and you’ll see it’s not like this in other democratic countries around the world. Voting in other democracies is a snap. And, if you’re really lucky, you might score a “democracy sausage.” When we showed voters from around the world what American elections are like in practice, they weren’t impressed. But they were impressed with our resilience and determination. So, while the world’s “oldest democracy” may be a bit creaky these days, let’s be clear: Go vote! That’s really the best way to make a change. Brendan Miller (@brenkjm) is a filmmaker.
