Then to Remote Learning<br></h1><p id="artcont">THE NEEDIEST CASES FUND Families found support after the coronavirus pandemic disrupted their children’s education. By Jonathan Wolfe Jansy Molina de Maldonado’s son couldn’t speak. When he was a year and a half, her son, Ian, loved to watch videos of dinosaurs, and could mimic the screeching and snarling he heard — but nothing more. By the time he was nearly 3, he still couldn’t say any words, and Mrs. Molina de Maldonado became distressed. “Dinosaurs don’t talk,” she said in a recent interview in Spanish. “And I noticed that he didn’t want to either. I became worried that something was very wrong.” Two months before the coronavirus pandemic hit the United States, Ms. Molina de Maldonado enrolled Ian in speech therapy classes. When the school shuttered, she was worried his education would languish. At the time, she had only seven books at home, she said, and they weren’t at Ian’s reading level. But a few weeks after lockdown began, she was able to bring home some new books for Ian, who fell in love with “Mowgli’s Rainy Day,” a story set in the world of “The Jungle Book,” and “Patitas Sucias,” or “Dirty Paws,” which follows the shenanigans of a messy dog.

Make a tax-deductible donation through GoFundMe. The family read to him several times a day and Ms. Molina de Maldonado worked with him using materials from his speech therapy classes. By the time she took him back to his Head Start program in May, he could say a few words like “mama,” “banana” and “snack.” A few more months of classes and reading at home, and Ian could speak in short sentences.
