With the Thanksgiving holiday almost here and more than two million new cases of the coronavirus already reported this month, nearly half the country, including all of the West Coast and the Northeast, has quarantine or travel restrictions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommend that Americans stay home for the holiday and that people should travel as little as possible in general. “Airports, bus stations, train stations, public transport, gas stations and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to the virus in the air and on surfaces,” the C.D.C. says on its website. As many as 50 million people were expected to travel for Thanksgiving this year, with 95 percent of all trips happening by car, according to a forecast from AAA. Despite the pandemic, that’s only a 10 percent drop compared with last year, though AAA noted that its modeling was done earlier this fall, before states like California, Pennsylvania and others implemented new quarantine restrictions in response to the alarming rise in virus cases. The number of air travelers was expected to be half what it was last year. People who are planning to travel outside of their home state should familiarize themselves with the virus rates where they plan to visit and assess the risk. For those who do decide to travel, the C.D.C. offers a series of recommendations for safety: that people wear a face mask in public, wash their hands frequently, avoid touching their face, keep six feet from others, cover coughs and sneezes, and use drive-through service and curbside pickup at restaurants and stores. Here is a summary of current restrictions in the United States for leisure travelers, although many states do not apply them to those staying for less than 24 hours. Some municipalities or counties may have more stringent regulations. There are generally exemptions for essential workers who are on the job, including health care workers, members of the military and others, but even they may be subject to some restrictions. Visits for medical care may be considered essential, as they are in Massachusetts, but some states, like New York, require the patient and their companion to remain quarantined when they are not at their appointment. As of Nov. 17, there were no statewide restrictions in Alabama. All nonresidents over the age of 10 must upload proof of a negative molecular-based SARS-CoV-2 test to an online travel portal, where they can also submit a travel declaration and self-isolation plan. Those who were tested within 72 hours before departure and are awaiting their results can enter the state, but must quarantine until proof of a negative finding can be uploaded. The state requests travelers get a second test done five to 14 days after arriving in Alaska. Visitors arriving without a previously taken test can get one for $250, and must self-quarantine while awaiting results, which may take three to five days or more. Testing is free for Alaska residents, who also have the option of a two-week quarantine instead of a test. Travelers pay their own quarantine costs. As of Nov. 17, there were no statewide restrictions in Arizona. As of Nov. 17, there were no statewide restrictions in Arkansas. California has been urging visitors and returning residents to self-quarantine for 14 days. Californians are discouraged from traveling for tourism or nonessential reasons. The state recommends that visitors call ahead to learn what local restrictions may also be in place. As of Nov. 17, there were no statewide restrictions, however Coloradans are discouraged from nonessential travel. People arriving from places other than Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Washington, D.C., must self-quarantine for 14 days and fill out a mandatory health form if they plan to stay for more than 24 hours. Travelers can avoid or shorten the quarantine period by providing proof of a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival. A test can also be taken after arriving, but the traveler must remain in isolation until written proof of the negative result is provided to the Commissioner of Public Health by email at DPH.COVID-Travel@ct.gov or by fax at (860) 326-0529. The order applies to any traveler who has spent at least 24 hours in a high-risk area in the two weeks before their visit. Failure to comply with the order carries a fine of up to $500 per violation. As of Nov. 17, there were no statewide restrictions in Delaware. Anyone visiting for more than 24 hours from a high-risk area must get a negative coronavirus test no more than 72 hours before their arrival. If they are staying in Washington for more than three days, they must have another test done three to five days after arriving. The order excludes travelers from Maryland and Virginia because of their relationship with the district, but it applies to any jurisdiction with more than 10 positive cases per 100,000 people per day. The government of the District of Columbia isn’t providing a list of regions meeting the threshold, but an interactive map put together by The New York Times provides that information on a county-by-county basis. As of Nov. 17, there were no statewide restrictions in Florida. As of Nov. 17, there were no statewide restrictions in Georgia. People arriving in Hawaii can avoid a mandatory 14-day quarantine by providing proof of a coronavirus-negative Nucleic Acid Amplification test taken from a list of specific providers within 72 hours of the final leg of the trip. Beginning Nov. 24, travelers must have their negative test results before arrival in Hawaii to bypass quarantine. Travelers must also pass temperature screening at the airport and fill out a travel and health declaration form. Those whose test results are pending must quarantine for 14 days or the length of their stay, whichever is shorter. In addition to the pre-travel test, some counties require travelers age 5 and older to obtain a subsequent test after arrival. The County of Hawaii will randomly select about 25 percent of travelers for a free second test at the airport, and the visitor must stay at the airport while awaiting the result, usually about 30 minutes. The counties of Maui and Kaua’i request visitors take a voluntary second test 72 hours after arrival. The test is free in Maui County. In Kaua’i County, it is free for residents, but there is a $150 charge for visitors, which is offset by a gift certificate for that amount valid at certain restaurants and attractions. Additional restrictions for travel between counties also exists. People violating state quarantine requirements face up to a $5,000 fine and up to a year in prison. As of Nov. 17, there were no statewide restrictions in Idaho. As of Nov. 17, there were no statewide restrictions in Illinois. However, under an emergency travel order, Chicago has implemented a color-coded system to indicate whether visitors need to obtain a negative coronavirus test or quarantine. The colors — red, orange and yellow — are based on virus levels in other states and how those levels compare to the situation in Chicago. Those traveling from a “red” state are asked to avoid travel, but if they visit Chicago, they must quarantine for 14 days, or the length of their stay, whichever is shorter. As of Nov. 20, that will include: Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming. People from “orange” states are also asked to stay home, but should they visit, they can either quarantine or obtain a negative virus test result no more than 72 hours before their arrival. As of Nov. 20, those requirements will apply to: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia.

Everyone else must either self-quarantine for 14 days or sign a document stating that they had a negative result to a PCR or antigen coronavirus test within the previous 72 hours. The rule also applies to those taking a day trip out of state. Those in quarantine are allowed to leave their hotel only for limited outdoor activities, such as hiking, when no other people are around. An exemption to the testing exists for those under the age of 18 who are traveling from a nonexempt state to Maine with adults who have a recent negative test. Maine residents who travel to a state not on the exempted list must also quarantine when they return or, alternatively, test negative for the virus. Visitors and returning residents are asked to get a virus test in the 72 hours before arriving in Maryland or upon arrival. Those Marylanders who have traveled in the past week to a state with a positivity rate of greater than 10 percent should get a test and self-quarantine until a negative result is received. That leaves only Hawaii, Maine, New York City and Vermont, as well as the U.S. territories, excluding Puerto Rico, as non-restricted places to visit or return from. Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia are always exempt. Except for commuters, travelers passing through and people coming from states with a lower coronavirus transmission rate, anyone over the age of 10 must either quarantine for 14 days or provide proof of a negative molecular (PCR) SARS-CoV2 test taken within the previous 72 hours. Those awaiting test results must quarantine until a negative result is received. All adults over the age of 18 (or a minor traveling alone) who enter Massachusetts must fill out a travel form.

Those not wanting to take the tests must still quarantine for 14 days per Health Department regulations. States that are contiguous with New York are exempted from the quarantine protocol.
