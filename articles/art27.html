He originally endorsed Elizabeth Warren, then endorsed Joe Biden recently. During the July 2019 debate, Senator Warren showcased Mr. Barkan’s case as an example of how health insurance doesn’t work. Mr. Barkan is a champion of “Medicare for all.” The fact that he is backing Joe Biden shows, again, that Democrats are willing to paper over their differences to defeat President Trump. Barkan’s T-shirt said “Be a Hero,” the name of the group he started after confronting then-Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona on a plane and telling him to “be a hero” and oppose the 2017 G.O.P. tax cuts. Coming up: John Kerry and Colin Powell, speaking about national security. Here’s Kerry. Kerry was a top surrogate for Biden, when there was a campaign trail. John Kerry, a decorated veteran, has called his 2002 vote to authorize the war in Iraq the biggest regret of his political career. Kerry picks a backdrop that makes it look like he is still secretary of state – and talks about what Trump dismantles. He focuses on Trump as a laughingstock, and is the first to mention intelligence on Russia putting a bounty on American troops. Kerry clocked more than one million miles on the road as secretary of state. “Even the United States of America needs friends on this planet,” Kerry says. Kerry’s big theme: Alliances are a force-multiplier. Stephanie, I clocked many of those miles on the same plane. And it was a flying heap. Hearing from Brett McGurk – Trump’s representative for Syria, who resigned in protest. As he invoked “American exceptionalism,” a powerful phrase for many people, Mr. Kerry tied Trump to threats against democracy both here and abroad. Chuck Hagel — and John Kerry for that matter — is a close friend of Mr. Biden’s from their days on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He’s a Republican who served as secretary of defense in the Obama administration. The pictures of Trump and Kim Jong-un don’t look as good as they did in 2018. It’s a reminder that the result of the diplomacy was a much larger nuclear arsenal. The components of the convention so far lay out the various ways in which Trump’s chaotic behavior have impacted the country and the globe. This montage is again as much about Biden’s experience and character as policy, and contrasts by portraying Trump as a threat to national security. FACT CHECK Ady Barkan’s statistic that nearly 100 million Americans lack adequate insurance refers to the count of uninsured and underinsured people. According to a 2018 survey from the Commonwealth Fund, that number was about 87 million. A recent study estimated that more than five million Americans have lost their insurance this spring. Strikes me that this week is a real payoff for Biden’s years of Washington insiderism. Colin Powell focuses on values – not on policy. Astead, you’re right. It is leaning way in to Biden’s long history in national politics – something Trump and Republicans continue to attack. That Colin Powell, a Republican former secretary of state and four-star general, is backing Biden makes a big statement. It is a way to make Biden seem unrisky and unscary. “Today we are a country divided and we have a president doing everything in his power to keep it that way,” Powell said. Here comes the McCain portion. Invoking John McCain, the Republican nominee against the Obama-Biden ticket in 2008, is an interesting twist. David, we’re about to hear from Cindy McCain, the senator’s widow. Another Republican thorn in Trump’s side: Cindy McCain, the widow of the 2008 G.O.P. presidential nominee, extolling Biden’s ability to cross the aisle in the Senate. This section talking about Biden’s across-the-aisle relationships feels like something from a lost society in American politics and reflective of how modern Democrats think compared to Republicans. Who was the last Republican you heard extolling how often they had dinner or worked with Democrats? Repeating myself here: Powell and McCain are a clear effort to attract voters who might vote for other Republicans, but are skeptical or outright dislike Trump. (Who famously attacked McCain.) That was Biden with George Shultz a minute ago, the former secretary of state for Reagan, an effort to show a candidate willing to talk across the aisle. A counterpoint with Trump, but it won’t sell well with progressives. That’s such a good point, Reid. And David, it seems that they aren’t even attempting to talk to progressives tonight. I think part of Jill Biden’s appeal is her “everywoman” quality. For many people, she probably seems like the lady down the street. Jill and Joe Biden married in 1977. She has helped raise his two sons from his first marriage, and they have a daughter together. Jill Biden is professor of English at a Virginia community college. As second lady, she continued her teaching career. “She put us back together,” Joe Biden says of Jill Biden. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
