Slotnik [Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Tuesday. Weather: The temperature falls from mid-50s in the morning to mid-40s by evening. Gusty wind and scattered showers. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Dec. 8 (Immaculate Conception). New York is on the precipice of a grim holiday season, as coronavirus hospitalizations reach levels not seen in months. Governor Andrew M. Cuomo said on Monday that hospitalizations in the state topped 3,500 over the weekend, the most since May. He also said that 54 coronavirus-related deaths were reported across the state on Sunday. Nearly 1,000 people in died in November, according to The New York Times’s tally, the deadliest month since June. Mr. Cuomo announced new measures to help stem the second wave of the outbreak, focusing more on hospital capacity and pinpointing problem areas than on a broader shutdown. He also noted the importance of keeping elementary schools open, if possible, and outlined a plan for increased and balanced testing across the state. “Covid is shifting the battlefield dramatically, and we have entered a new phase,” he said. [Cuomo fears a “nightmare of overwhelmed hospitals” as virus cases spike.] Here’s what you need to know: More than 34,000 people have died in New York since the first case was discovered in March, more than in any other state. Mr. Cuomo said that over the weekend, the state’s daily rate of positive tests for the coronavirus topped 4 percent for the first time since May. When infection rates accelerated in the spring, hospitals were flooded with coronavirus patients, and doctors and nurses were exhausted. “We are not going to live through the nightmare of overwhelmed hospitals again,” Mr. Cuomo said. The governor said that over 65 percent of the current spread was caused by small gatherings of people, which proliferate during the holiday season. He cautioned that he expected infection rates in New York to keep climbing until at least mid-January. “Covid is the Grinch,” Mr. Cuomo said at a press briefing on Monday, adding that “the Covid Grinch sees this as the season of viral transmission.”
