Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Thursday. Weather: Sunny and warmer, with a stiff breeze in the afternoon. High in the low to mid-70s. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Nov. 1 (All Saints’ Day). Just before protests erupted in response to the killing of George Floyd on Memorial Day weekend, a video went viral: It showed a white woman making a false report to the police on a Black man. Christian Cooper, a prominent bird-watcher, had approached the woman, Amy Cooper, and had asked her to put her dog on a leash, as the rules mandated in a section of Central Park known as the Ramble. She had responded by calling 911 and repeatedly telling the operator that an “African-American man” was threatening her. The video has been seen nearly 45 million times, and the incident was widely viewed as a glaring example of everyday racism. On Wednesday, a Manhattan prosecutor revealed that Ms. Cooper, who was charged with filing a false report to police, didn’t call 911 just once. She called a second time, falsely claiming that Mr. Cooper tried to assault her. When the police arrived, she told an officer that her allegation was untrue.

Here’s what you need to know: The second 911 call was unreported until Wednesday morning at Ms. Cooper’s hearing for the misdemeanor charge, which carries a maximum sentence of a year in jail. “The defendant twice reported that an African-American man was putting her in danger, first by stating that he was threatening her and her dog, then making a second call indicating that he tried to assault her in the Ramble area of the park,” said Joan Illuzzi, a senior prosecutor. The criminal complaint against Ms. Cooper mentions both calls, but she was only charged with one count of filing a false report. No additional charges were announced on Wednesday.
