Areas<br></h1><p id="artcont">The abrupt announcement caused confusion over the official response to virus spikes and threatened to deepen tensions with the mayor. By Jesse McKinley and Luis Ferré-Sadurní ALBANY, N.Y. — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Monday refused to allow New York City to close nonessential businesses in nine hot spots in Brooklyn and Queens where the coronavirus has spiked, pre-empting a plan announced the day before by Mayor Bill de Blasio. The governor’s stance created more confusion over how the authorities intend to tackle early signs of a second wave of the virus in its one-time epicenter. Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, also accelerated the plan to close schools in the affected areas, moving the closure date up a day to Tuesday. The governor’s announcement seemed to be yet another manifestation of his long feud with Mr. de Blasio. Mr. Cuomo has frequently second-guessed or overruled the mayor, also a Democrat, during their tenures. Indeed, the governor also announced that the state would take over supervision of enforcement of mask and social-distancing rules in the hot spot clusters, presumably putting the State Police in charge of New York City Police Department officers. “Local government will need to provide us with personnel,” the governor said.  </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
