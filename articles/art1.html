By Azi Paybarah and Allyson Waller Seven people were fatally shot early Monday morning inside a Southern California home about 75 miles north of San Diego that the authorities said might have housed an illegal marijuana-growing operation. More than 1,000 pounds of marijuana and “several hundred” marijuana plants were found at the house in Aguanga, a rural, unincorporated area of Riverside County, according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department. One victim, a woman, was transported by paramedics to a hospital for treatment, the office said. All seven died as a result of their injuries, officials said. A spokesman for the office declined on Tuesday to provide any details about the victims, their injuries or potential suspects. In a statement on Monday, the sheriff’s office said the killings appear “to have been an isolated incident” and posed “no threat to the general public.” Medical marijuana has been legal in California for 20 years and the sale of recreational marijuana was legalized in 2016. But the state’s longtime illegal marijuana market has continued to thrive, officials have said. Experts say that is because of the surplus of marijuana in the area as well as a patchwork of laws by local governments regulating the newly legalized industry. Riverside County has regulated commercial cannabis operations since December 2018. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
