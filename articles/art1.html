By Philip Galanes A new friend in the Midwest was invited to an outdoor Halloween party where mask-wearing was requested. We went shopping for an art-inspired costume for her. But I saw that she was gravitating toward period costumes. After the party, she posted pictures online. I was stunned! She wore a full-blown Scarlett O’Hara-type gown — to a mansion, no less! If I’d known, I would have tried to talk her out if it. This year’s widespread Black Lives Matter protests, along with the traditional whitewashing of the antebellum South, make her choice seem insensitive. I’ll be seeing her soon, and I already feel awkward. I know she’ll share details of the party, and I feel obligated to enlighten her. Any advice? FRIEND It’s one thing if your friend went to the party dressed as Scarlett O’Hara. Casually masquerading as the heroine of a racist novel and film in which Black people are portrayed as happy slaves is problematic. Costume parties don’t offer enough context for racial commentary. But it’s another thing if your friend simply rented a Victorian dress with a crinoline underneath to make the skirt poof out. That style originated in England and became fashionable in many places (with ever larger hoop skirts) in the mid-19th century. The dresses are not primarily associated slavery or the South. Women in the North wore them, too. So, which was she: dressed as a character, or from an era? Be careful about jumping to racism. (Your desire to “enlighten” your friend sounds condescending.) If you’re not sure, ask her: “What was your Halloween costume?” If she says Scarlett, ask if she considered the racial implications. If not, save your energy for clear-cut instances of racism. I broke up with my boyfriend during our coronavirus quarantine. Recently, he was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. He begged me not to let him die alone. So I now have frequent video chats with him, accompany him to doctors’ appointments and even stayed overnight in the hospital with him after he was admitted for pneumonia. The problem: He thinks we’re back together again and wants to resume our sex life (which his doctor blessed). I don’t have those feelings for him anymore, but I don’t want to hurt him, either. Should I have mercy sex with him or tell him I’m not into him? ANONYMOUS
