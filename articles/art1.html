By Mark Leibovich WASHINGTON — Leaders in public life, and certainly in Washington, talk about ruling with iron fists and wielding levers of power while repeatedly ignoring the obvious: Fate will always be in charge. Even the most bullheaded authorities will occasionally acknowledge this. “Going well, I think!” President Trump tweeted late Friday. Of all the confusing, confounding and contradictory words that have been spun out of the White House in recent days, that two-word caveat — “I think” — was instantly seized upon by the president’s allies and adversaries alike. “I think” was a slight but notable departure from pretty much everything we’ve come to expect from an embattled president who does not like to betray any uncertainty whatsoever. “Trump isn’t one for equivocation or understatement,” noted Politico’s Playbook, the widely read Beltway tipsheet. As Mr. Trump remained hospitalized on Sunday after an expanding group of Senate Republicans and White House aides tested positive for the coronavirus, the situation offered yet another example of why politicians are advised to be humble, or act humble, if they can possibly stand it. “The essence of our breakdown in politics is the mentality that I’m right and you’re totally wrong,” said former Senator John Danforth, Republican of Missouri. “And because I’m so sure that I’m right and you’re totally wrong, I am justified in destroying you as a person.” The absence of humility, Mr. Danforth said, can poison any chance for a collaborative culture. He is hardly the first to suggest this. “Those who travel the high road of humility in Washington, D.C., are not bothered by heavy traffic,” said the former Senator Alan Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, in a 2018 eulogy for President George Bush. It is a familiar adage around the capital, if rarely heeded. Exhibit A currently resides in the presidential suite at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. If Mr. Trump has a single superpower, it is his ability to project self-assurance at all times. He played the authoritative boss on television. He has mastered the talent of seeming to be in full command of his circumstances — even when he is plainly terrified or saying things that are untrue or that contradict an assertion that he made just a minute earlier. And even when the president is tweeting news — as he did early Friday, when he announced that he and the first lady had tested positive — that would commence a weekend of pounding uncertainty across the country, dissembling from his staff members and doctors and news of other positive tests all around the president.
