By Peter Baker, John Branch, John Eligon, Reid J. Epstein, Dan Levin and Marc Stein WASHINGTON — And then Chadwick Boseman died. On a Friday night, a way-too-young Hollywood star who had inspired fans around the world suddenly was gone without warning. After everything else, it was just too much for many. “I HATE 2020” began trending on Twitter. Not for the first time and probably not for the last. It has been a year of tragedy, of catastrophe, of upheaval, a year that has inflicted one blow after another, a year that has filled the morgues, emptied the schools, shuttered the workplaces, swelled the unemployment lines and polarized the electorate. It is a year in which one Black American after another fell victim to the police and one city after another erupted in flames. If the worst pandemic in a century and the worst economic collapse in nearly a century and the worst social unrest in a half-century were not enough, nature threw in a few more challenges in recent days in the form of rampaging wildfires out west and a ferocious hurricane down south. At times, it has felt biblical, as if a torrent of plagues had been unleashed all at once. At least the locusts, for the moment, have not migrated here from East Africa. But while 2020 feels cursed, it is still only two-thirds over. What could the next four months bring before the calendar turns? If nothing else, a bitter, angry, ugly, divisive presidential campaign followed by an Election Day that may not end on Election Day. It could stretch for days, weeks or even months without an undisputed outcome. So on top of another 1918 and another 1929 and another 1968, try adding another 2000, another Florida recount, but this time with, both candidates agree, nothing less than American democracy on the line. As the fall contest gets underway after the nominating conventions, the national mood is sour. Only 13 percent of Americans are satisfied with the way things are going in the United States, the lowest such rating in nine years and one of the lowest since Gallup began asking the question in 1979. Here are the stories of five Americans struggling with the challenges of the day: a firefighter who once lost his own home to flames, a young immigrant who lost his parents to the coronavirus, a sports star closing down games to protest racial injustice, a political activist navigating a campaign of divisions, a neighbor trying to make sense of the latest senseless police shooting. Dmitri Menzel has been fighting one of California’s biggest fires for most of two weeks. He is a strike-team leader, overseeing five engines from five jurisdictions, patrolling the volatile edges of the Hennessey fire in 24-hour shifts — 24 on, 24 off. Mr. Menzel and his crew spent the early days battling flames in unforgiving canyons, thick with drought-dried underbrush, saving more houses than they lost, wondering how much more could be done if only they had more resources — more firefighters, more air power, more bulldozers. The past couple of shifts have been spent snuffing out hot spots and helping homeowners who have returned to find their worlds nothing but a blanket of ashes. Mr. Menzel, 51 and a married father of three, knows the feeling. He lost his home in 2017 to the Tubbs fire that roared through Santa Rosa. “When you say, ‘I’ve lost my house, too,’ you instantly have a connection,” Mr. Menzel said. “I hope there’s some relief. They see I’m still here, I’m still working. This isn’t the end. You can get through this.” He offers advice for sifting through the ashes. Use fine-gauge chicken wire stapled to two-by-fours. Mentally try to recreate the floor plan. Think about where you left things, where things were in relation to other things. Fire does not rearrange a home, not like a tornado or a hurricane. Still, he and his wife, Becky, never found the wedding ring that was on the bathroom counter upstairs. Mr. Menzel wonders: Did the second floor collapse a certain way, so it did not fall straight down to the ground? They looked everywhere. The ring is probably buried under the new house now. The latest rash of Northern California fires, hundreds of them, started mostly with a freakish lightning storm without rain two weeks ago. Almost all were in extremely remote places. Most burned themselves out. Some raged in impenetrable canyons and merged with others until much of the Bay Area was ringed by fire. Mr. Menzel, a deputy chief for the Novato Fire Department, was dispatched to lead a strike team at what is called the L.N.U. Lightning Complex. By Friday, fires there had burned roughly 370,000 acres, or nearly 600 square miles. The first shift lasted 48 hours. Mr. Menzel’s crew of 20 played hopscotch with fires burning through homes around Lake Berryessa. They would try to hold a line, watch the fire blow past and reset their ambitions. Choices were made. The strike team protected one ridge but gave up another. “We lost a lot of homes here, maybe 20 or 30,” Mr. Menzel said, using his hands as ridges and valleys. “But we were able to save, probably, a couple hundred here.” He paused. He knows the value of a home. The last three years have been exhausting. Mr. Menzel was visiting his daughter at college in October 2017 when the Tubbs fire rampaged overnight through swaths of Santa Rosa, fueled by winds and the element of surprise. Becky and the couple’s 5-year-old daughter got out in time. While waiting two years for their house to be rebuilt, they were forced to evacuate the home they rented in nearby Windsor because of the Kincade fire. These days, their rebuilt neighborhood is shrouded in smoke again. “Mentally, I’m tired,” Mr. Menzel said. “The last two or three years, it’s affected me personally, emotionally. I’m just tired.” There are mornings when, in the haze between slumber and wakefulness, Nashwan Ismael reaches for his phone so he can tell his mother about a bad dream. Then he remembers: Both his parents are dead, victims of the coronavirus that has left the 20-year-old with adult burdens he is completely unprepared to shoulder. With no income or close relatives near the Detroit suburb where he lives, Mr. Ismael has struggled to pay bills, find a job and care for his younger sisters, even as the three orphans mourn the loss of their parents — Christian refugees from Iraq who built them a new life in America that now lies in ruins. “I’ve got to be strong for my sisters; that’s all that matters now,” Mr. Ismael said, sitting in his father’s car outside the family’s home so his siblings could not overhear him admit how scared and lonely he felt. “I don’t have somebody to be strong for me,” he said, struggling to hold back tears. Like so many Americans, Mr. Ismael had no idea that 2020 would be marred by unspeakable tragedy. He and his family fled Baghdad in 2012, eventually settling in Sterling Heights, Mich., where his father got a job at an auto parts plant and his mother became a homemaker. Safely removed from the trauma of war, they prospered, and within a few years were able to put a down payment on a house. In March, Mr. Ismael’s parents presented him with a gift, a new red Chevrolet Camaro. A few days later, as coronavirus cases in Michigan were mounting, his father developed a fever and a cough, then tested positive for the virus. Soon his mother began having shortness of breath. Both parents were hospitalized on March 22 and intubated not long afterward. Mr. Ismael’s mother, Nada Naisan, died on April 21, followed less than three weeks later by his father, Nameer Ayram, who succumbed to complications from the virus on May 11. In the months since their parents’ deaths, the Ismael children have been forced to grow up faster than they ever imagined. Mr. Ismael and his sister, Nadeen, 18, are working with lawyers to obtain guardianship of their 13-year-old sister and transfer ownership of the house. Mr. Ismael wanted to become a pilot. Now he just wants to find a decent job as he figures out how to pay for car insurance, his sisters’ schooling and their parents’ mortgage.
