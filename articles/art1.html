Feels right for a crowd-less evening. Over on Fox News, Tucker Carlson has been showing a “live shot” of the convention: a deserted windswept plaza in Milwaukee, where very few Democrats actually are. Fortunately we won’t have to fact check Reid tonight. Speaking of, hello everyone. Looking forward to keeping tabs on what the speakers are saying and keeping them honest. Hi, Alan! This isn’t the same as typing next to you in Philadelphia like in 2016. Alas. It’s good to join you again nonetheless. If I recall, Night 1 in Philly 2016 included an apocalyptic storm. In all seriousness, I’m not sure what to expect from a virtual convention. The crowd reaction at conventions is a significant part of the evenings every four years. There is not the same opportunity for boos from the floor during a speech, for instance. So the show is about to start. The first thing we expect to see is the aforementioned Ms. Longoria welcoming us to the convention. After that Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the convention’s chairman, will gavel in the festivities before the Biden grandchildren say the Pledge of Allegiance. For those curious how a virtual convention actually works: the central TV control room is in Milwaukee, where a D.N.C. crew – including the producer of the Super Bowl halftime show – are coordinating dozens of video feeds from around the country. The show will be a mix of live and pre-recorded segments; Bernie Sanders is speaking from Burlington, Vt., while Michelle Obama taped her speech last week from her home on Martha’s Vineyard. Even the people who are planning to deliver live speeches have prerecorded versions that can be played in case their live feeds go haywire. It’s not certain that we will be able to know who is live and who is on tape based on what we see. I’m curious how much the Biden campaign and D.N.C. can turn a virtual convention into a cash source. The Clinton campaign got a significant bump in small-dollar donations during the convention week in 2016. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is already fund-raising off the event. She sent an appeal highlighting how John Kasich – the Republican former governor of Ohio who is speaking tonight – attacked her today, saying an “anti-choice, anti-worker Republican” doesn’t get to determine the direction of the Democratic party. Easy to forget now, but much of the Clinton convention four years ago centered on Republican voices (including veterans of Republican presidential administrations) holding their nose to support a Democrat. Also, Reid, delivering speeches direct to tape is a skill. And one that’s very unlike speaking before a live crowd. Curious to see who is good at it. Don’t kick me out of political reporter chat, but I have not necessarily found conventions must-see TV in the past. I am curious how they attempt to change that with … all of this. Jenny, a lot of veteran TV producers are asking the same question about this year’s event. Network executives I talked to earlier today still weren’t sure how this will all play out. Michael, do you think the networks might adjust their plans at all for the rest of the week after gauging interest/absence of interest tonight? Here we go! Eva Longoria on a sound stage. Already, it’s clear how different this is. Fleg, if the producers decide this thing is a snooze, we’ll see anchors and pundits jumping in a lot more often with color commentary, instead of the pre-taped segments (propaganda?) served up by the Democratic party. Feels more like a telethon than a convention … at least in the opening. This style reminds me of the remote address Obama and LeBron James did for graduating seniors. Which was largely well-received. This feels like a really long political ad like the ones that campaigns serve up on Facebook or YouTube. Michael, can you give us some behind the scenes of how this is working? Is Eva in a studio? Jenny, Eva is speaking live from a studio in Los Angeles. The main production crew is in Milwaukee. News anchors are watching from studios in New York and Washington. And we’re all on our couches! Truly nationwide. A Khizr Khan cameo in this video. He played quite a role in 2016:  It’s a mix of activists, moderately well-known political stars like Khizr Khan and rising stars, like Lina Hidalgo. Those were Joe Biden’s five grandchildren reciting the pledge. There is clearly a huge effort to showcase diversity here, which was a big concern for some of the grumblers we mentioned earlier. A waggish member of my household asks where the “Skip Ad” button is on this opening segment. Kids! I am such a sucker for all things featuring kids. I mean, who isn’t? And now we have a montage of children singing the national anthem. This may be a very montage-heavy experience given the need to fit a lot of people into a relatively short amount of time. If these voices were all recorded separately, this is some impressive vocal mixing. What did we say about “We Are the World” earlier? Our first mass musical number three minutes in! </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
