Pearce of the Salt Lake City Police Department ordered the dog to bite Jeffrey Ryans, even though Mr. Ryans was doing nothing to resist, prosecutors said. By Michael Levenson A Salt Lake City police officer was charged with aggravated assault on Wednesday, five months after he ordered his police dog to attack a Black man who was on his knees with his hands in the air, prosecutors said. The officer, Nickolas J. Pearce, ordered the dog to bite the man, Jeffrey Ryans, even though Mr. Ryans was doing nothing to resist officers during a domestic violence call on April 24, according to the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office. Repeatedly saying “good boy,” Officer Pearce encouraged the dog, Tuco, as it sank its teeth into Mr. Ryans’s leg, and Mr. Ryans cried out in pain, the district attorney’s office said in a probable cause statement. The episode came to light in August, when The Salt Lake Tribune published a report on the encounter that included body-camera footage. Utah state law allows officers to use force, but “when you cross that threshold, you need to be held accountable, just like anybody else,” Sim Gill, the Salt Lake County district attorney, said in an interview on Wednesday. Aggravated assault, a felony, carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. Officer Pearce, 39, who is white and has been on the force for 14 years, was placed on administrative leave in August, and remained on leave on Wednesday, according to the Salt Lake City Police Department. It was not immediately clear whether he had a lawyer. There was no answer at phone numbers listed under his name.
