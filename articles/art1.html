By Henry Fountain Greenland lost a record amount of ice in 2019, researchers reported Thursday. Nearly half of it was lost in July, when the region roasted from an unusual heat wave. The net ice loss of more than 530 billion metric tons was more than twice the annual average since 2003, the scientists said. In July, when warm air from Europe moved north, leading to temperatures that were well above normal and causing widespread surface melting of the ice sheet, the loss was roughly equal to the average loss in a full year. Ingo Sasgen, a geoscientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, and the lead author of a paper describing the findings in the journal Communications and Environment, said with the warmth last summer, he and his colleagues suspected that 2019 would be a bad one for the ice sheet. They analyzed data from a pair of satellites that precisely measure the gravitational pull, and thus the mass, of the area they are orbiting over. “It took us some time to analyze it and quantify it robustly, but it turned out to be another record melt year,” Dr. Sasgen said. In the previous record year, 2012, the net loss was about 460 billion metric tons. Yara Mohajerani, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington who was not involved in the study, said it was “part of a series of studies that have shown the same thing,” including work that he did that reported record ice loss in summer 2019. Updated Aug. 18, 2020 Here’s what you need to know this week: Greenland’s ice sheet is nearly two miles thick in places, and if all the ice were to melt, sea levels would rise about 24 feet, or about 7.5 meters.
