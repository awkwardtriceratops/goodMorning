By Michael Crowley For nearly four years, President Trump has publicly railed against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, angrily demanding that its members pay more for Europe’s collective defense. In private, Mr. Trump has gone further — speaking repeatedly about withdrawing altogether from the 71-year-old military alliance, according to those familiar with the conversations. In a second term, he may get his chance. Recent accounts by former senior national security officials in the Trump administration have contributed to growing unease on Capitol Hill and across Europe. They lend credence to a scenario in which Mr. Trump, emboldened by re-election and potentially surrounded by an inexperienced second-term national security team, could finally move to undermine — or even end — the United States’ NATO membership. These former officials warn that such a move would be one of the biggest global strategic shifts in generations and a major victory for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Although Mr. Trump has been known to have expressed interest in withdrawing the United States from the Atlantic alliance since 2018, new evidence of his thinking has emerged in the run-up to the November election. This summer, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser John R. Bolton published a book that described the president as repeatedly saying he wanted to quit the alliance. Last month, Mr. Bolton speculated to a Spanish newspaper that Mr. Trump might even spring an “October surprise” shortly before the election by declaring his intention to leave the alliance in a second term. And in a book published this week, Michael S. Schmidt, a New York Times reporter, wrote that Mr. Trump’s former chief of staff John F. Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general, told others that “one of the most difficult tasks he faced with Trump was trying to stop him from pulling out of NATO.” One person who has heard Mr. Kelly speak in private settings confirmed that he had made such remarks. Though the president routinely complains that other NATO members should spend more on defense — often betraying confusion about how the 30-nation alliance operates — Mr. Trump has not publicly threatened to leave it. During the Republican National Convention last week, he boasted of having pressured other members into increasing their defense budgets, but did not suggest he had bigger changes in mind for the alliance. A 50-point second-term agenda released by Mr. Trump’s campaign last month made no specific mention of the alliance, although it featured a familiar promise to “get allies to pay their fair share.” On Wednesday, Mr. Trump spoke in North Carolina at an event commemorating the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II — a conflict from whose ashes the alliance was formed to protect Western Europe from the Soviet Union — but made no mention of a continuing American security relationship with the continent. For the past several months, the security establishments in Washington and Europe have briefly exhaled, concluding that Mr. Trump is unlikely to challenge the alliance’s core tenets before the end of this term. But as the election approaches, experts say anxiety is growing. “It is a real risk,” said Thomas Wright, the director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington. “We know from Kelly and Bolton that he wanted to go much further in the first term. If he feels that he has been totally vindicated in the election, and he feels that people have endorsed his policies, I think he could effectively withdraw from NATO.”
