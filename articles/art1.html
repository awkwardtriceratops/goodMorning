By Richard Sandomir Ray Cave, who as the managing editor of Time magazine for eight years oversaw changes to its stodgy look and encouraged the publication of single-subject issues like “Children of War,” died on Monday at his home in Boothbay, Me. He was 91. His daughter, C.C. Cave, confirmed the death. Mr. Cave became Time's top editor in the fall of 1977, when the magazine was still a swaggering journalistic force, unimpeded by competition from the internet. Time was the leading newsweekly when weekly magazines were still flourishing. Its pages were flush with ads. “The magazine’s goal,” Mr. Cave told Adweek in 1983 when it named him “the hottest editor” in its annual magazine report, “is to inform the public, to help our society debate more issues, and on occasion to help shape that debate.” Under Mr. Cave, there were more lifestyle cover articles on subjects like cats, ice cream and cholesterol; new sections like American Scene, Computers, Video and Food; and, in 1982, the anointing of the Machine of the Year (the personal computer), a departure from the traditional Man or Woman of the Year (now Person of the Year) issue. The single-subject issues published under Mr. Cave included ones about Japan, prisons and “Children of War,” a 25,000-word article written in 1982 by Roger Rosenblatt, a magazine essayist. Mr. Rosenblatt said that Mr. Cave approved his idea — to depict the lives of children in five war zones around the world — without hesitation. In an interview, Mr. Rosenblatt recalled fearing that a passage he had written might imperil the life of a 15-year-old Vietnamese boy, one of many refugees who fled their homeland and were known as boat people, who had accused a boat captain of murder. Hours before the Asian edition was to be printed, he called Mr. Cave. “I told Ray I had screwed up,” Mr. Rosenblatt said. “I asked him, ‘Can I rewrite it in a way that fudges it?’ And he said, ‘Go ahead.’ “It was a two-line fix that cost the magazine $65,000. He didn’t think about it. I don’t know how many people would do that.” An intensely competitive executive, Mr. Cave kept up Time’s rivalry with Newsweek, the No. 2 newsweekly. In early 1978, he learned that Newsweek was going to publish excerpts in successive issues from the memoirs of H.R. Haldeman, President Richard M. Nixon’s disgraced chief of staff, who had served 18 months in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal. To blunt Newsweek’s scoop, Mr. Cave countered with a cover article about Muhammad Ali (who had recently lost his heavyweight title), followed by one the next week about the supermodel Cheryl Tiegs, which became one of Time’s best-selling issues to date. In 1985, Time won the National Magazine Award for general excellence.
