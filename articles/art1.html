By Cass R. Sunstein and Adrian Vermeule Mr. Sunstein and Mr. Vermeule are law professors. More than at any time since the 1930s, the administrative state is under constitutional assault. Some judges, lawyers and legal academics are calling into question the very structure of modern government. Four members of the U.S. Supreme Court, and possibly five, have indicated that they would like to revive the “nondelegation doctrine,” which would forbid Congress from granting excessively broad or uncabined discretion to administrative agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Labor and the Department of Transportation. Under their approach, important parts of the Clean Air Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act might be invalidated. So too, in eliminating the independence of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in June, a majority of the Supreme Court cast a dark constitutional cloud over the long-established idea that Congress has the power to allow agencies to operate independently of the president. The court’s approach raises serious doubts about the legal status of the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Trade Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other such entities. These developments are just two of a large number of emerging efforts within the federal courts to limit the power of administrative agencies or perhaps even to abolish them, at least in their current form. We are witnessing the flowering of a longstanding attempt to see the administrative state as fundamentally illegitimate. (The legal assault on the administrative state has political resonance, too; think of the former Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s call for the “deconstruction of the administrative state.”) Viewed most sympathetically, those efforts reflect a commitment to the values of legality, accountability and liberty — understanding all these values in particular, highly controversial ways. But the best way to promote such values is not by deconstructing anything, but by adapting and making new an old idea: the rule of law. About 60 years ago, the legal philosopher Lon Fuller specified the conditions that he believed were necessary, at least in some minimal form, for the very existence of law. They were: the making of rules, so that issues aren’t decided on a case-by-case basis; transparency, so that affected parties are aware of the relevant rules; not applying rules retroactively, so that people can rely on current rules; comprehensibility, so that people understand the rules; not issuing rules that contradict one another; not issuing rules that require people to do things they lack the power to do; relative stability of rules, so that people can orient their action in accordance with them; and no mismatch between rules as announced and rules as administered. Writing against the background set by fascism and communism, Professor Fuller claimed that if a government entirely failed to meet any of these conditions, it would fail to have “a legal system at all.” But he also saw the principles underlying these procedural virtues as moral ideals within law — aspirational principles that, judiciously applied, would help to make governance not only respectful of legality but also more efficacious. In Professor Fuller’s view, law has a kind of internal morality. His account of the morality of law is an excellent way of channeling modern administration into its best forms — and of responding to the strongest arguments of those who want to limit the authority of administrators. In our view, courts should be taking the morality of law quite seriously. Fortunately, they often do. Indeed, many of the principles of legal morality that Professor Fuller listed have been invoked by the Roberts court in a number of domains.
