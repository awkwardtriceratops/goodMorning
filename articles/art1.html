Biden Jr.’s running mate. She gained considerable experience as a debater during the Democratic primary season and also has a record as an aggressive questioner in Senate hearings. Her goal will be to keep the focus on Mr. Trump’s performance while also defending Mr. Biden’s long record and the positions he has taken in this campaign. Other topics likely to come up include the state of the economy and Mr. Trump’s decision to halt negotiations for another stimulus package; the battle over Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett; racial tensions, police violence and threats from white supremacists, and a variety of national security issues including the rise of China and Russia’s election meddling. A team of reporters from The New York Times is fact-checking the debate, providing analysis and context. By Linda Qiu — Mr. Pence Mr. Trump did not ban all travel from China, nor did Mr. Biden call his executive order restricting travel xenophobic. The travel restrictions, put in place on Jan. 31, only applied to foreign citizens and included exceptions, ultimately allowing 40,000 people to travel from China to the United States from the end of January to April. Mr. Biden has generally criticized Mr. Trump for “xenophobia” and “fear-mongering” in his response to the coronavirus. (Mr. Trump has used the phrase “Chinese virus” in describing the outbreak.) But The Times was unable to find an instance of him using those words to describe the restrictions specifically. In April, the Biden campaign said that Mr. Biden supported the restrictions, as they had the backing of scientists and public health officials. By Linda Qiu — Ms. Harris Ms. Harris is taking Mr. Trump’s comments out of context. He was speaking about the Democrats’ criticism of his administration’s response to the pandemic and comparing it to the “impeachment hoax,” not the virus itself. “Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue,” Mr. Trump said at a February rally in South Carolina. “They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning, they lost, it’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax,” he continued.
