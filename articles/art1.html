By Daniel E. Slotnik A federal judge in Manhattan on Friday ordered a new trial for Gigi Jordan, who was convicted of killing her 8-year-old autistic son after mounting a novel defense based on her belief that her first husband would murder her and her second would victimize the boy after her death. Ms. Jordan was convicted in 2014 of manslaughter and sentenced in 2015 to 18 years in prison after a trial that became tabloid fodder. Now she may well go free because a prosecutor asked for, and a judge granted, a closed-door hearing during her trial. The facts of Ms. Jordan’s case are not in dispute. She admitted poisoning her son, Jude Mirra, in 2010 by giving him a lethal dose of medication in a luxury hotel room in Midtown Manhattan. But Ms. Jordan, a wealthy medical entrepreneur, said that she had done so only because she thought that her first husband would kill her and that her son would wind up in the custody of his father, her second husband, whom she suspected of sexually abusing him. Both men strongly denied the accusations. After five days of deliberations, the jury accepted Ms. Jordan’s “extreme emotional disturbance” defense, a strategy usually reserved for murders committed at the height of passion, and found her guilty of manslaughter instead of murder. She has since been serving her sentence, first on Rikers Island and later at a women’s prison in Bedford Hills, N.Y. But an unusual episode during the trial may result in Ms. Jordan’s release. On Oct. 1, 2014, an assistant district attorney, Matthew Bogdanos, asked Judge Charles H. Solomon to close the courtroom for an off-the-record discussion.
