But is that even possible? Chana finds two schools that are trying to do just that, and both are actually inside the I.S. 293 building. One is downstairs in the basement, where a charter school called Success Academy Cobble Hill opened about seven years ago. The other is upstairs at the newly-renamed Boerum Hill School for International Studies. The original score for “Nice White Parents” was written and performed by The Bad Plus, a jazz group. The band consists of the bassist Reid Anderson, the pianist Orrin Evans and the drummer Dave King. Additional music from Matt McGinley, who has contributed music to Serial Productions podcasts including “S-Town” and Season 3 of “Serial.” Matt is also the drummer and a co-founder of the band Gym Class Heroes. Special thanks to Sam Dolnick, Julie Whitaker, Seth Lind, Julia Simon and Lauren Jackson. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
