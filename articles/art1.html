The Pandemic Changed That.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Hoboken and Jersey City, often nicknamed the “sixth boroughs” of New York City, have their residents back full time. By Ashley Fetters When Mikey Miller, an aspiring actor and theater writer, moved to Jersey City in May 2019, he expected to live there only in the most technical sense. His address would be in New Jersey, but his livelihood would be in New York City, and for the first 10 months, his plan worked perfectly: He commuted to Manhattan on the PATH train almost every day to see and review Broadway productions, audition for shows, and tutor high-school students. But when the coronavirus outbreak descended on the East Coast in March, closing theaters and schools and sending New Yorkers into isolation, Mr. Miller, 24, had no reason to visit the city anymore. Unsure of what else to do, he began wandering around Jersey City on foot. Sometimes, he stopped in front of closed restaurants to peer inside and read the menus posted in their windows. He discovered how peaceful Liberty State Park was. For someone who had once dreamed of relocating to Manhattan’s Upper East Side, he was beginning to enjoy what he thought was his starter neighborhood. “If I were to make my residence ultimately in downtown Jersey City,” he said, “I would have no problem with that.” For decades, Hoboken and Jersey City, long in competition to be New York City’s honorary “sixth borough,” have served urbanites like Mr. Miller, who sleep in New Jersey but spend most of their waking hours across the Hudson River. As recently as this past February, more than 68,000 commuters from Jersey City and Hoboken boarded the PATH train that connects the two cities to Manhattan every weekday morning, and still more commuted by ferry or bus. Certainly, some of those residents were taking the PATH to other destinations in New Jersey — but in 2014, the population of Hudson County (home to Hoboken, Jersey City, and 10 other municipalities) was found to shrink by 40,000 during the day. After New York went on lockdown, the number of commuters dwindled. By August, only about 8,300 people from Hoboken and Jersey City took the PATH train on weekday mornings. Of course, many residents of Hoboken and Jersey City are not commuters and have long spent their lives immersed in their own cities. Still, people have been staying at home. Many are reckoning with the fact that they are now full-time New Jerseyans. Some have adapted by moving into more spacious apartments with access to the outdoors; some have moved farther west into the suburbs; and many more, like Mr. Miller, have simply stayed put, recommitting themselves to the neighborhoods they used to ignore. Hoboken, for example, has seen increased interest in local volunteer efforts. “There has been a tremendous outpouring of people who want to help,” especially with efforts to combat food insecurity during the pandemic, said Ravinder S. Bhalla, the mayor of Hoboken. Natalie Ramunni is doing her part to help Hoboken’s restaurants. Before March, Ms. Ramunni, 27, spent about six days a week in the city, when she was not traveling for her Instagram account Follow the Fork. After the lockdown, she made Follow hyperlocal, reaching out to Hoboken restaurants to ask about takeout and delivery options. “I wanted to help,” Ms. Ramunni said, “and communicate to people, ‘If you love this restaurant, there’s still a way to eat there.’” When Ms. Ramunni first moved to Hoboken after graduating from college, she thought her stay would be a quick pit stop on the way to Manhattan. She has now been in Hoboken for six years. “It’s just more of a community,” she said. “There’s a little bit more of that tight-knit comfortability that New York City doesn’t give you sometimes.” Alex Elgarten has also used the shutdown to learn more about Jersey City. Although he and his wife had moved there from Brooklyn in May of 2019, they continued to spend much of their social time in the city. They both worked in Manhattan and went out for dinner dates there, or sometimes returned to their favorite haunts in Brooklyn. Now, after six months firmly grounded in Jersey City, Mr. Elgarten, 33, can rattle off his favorite local restaurants, walking routes, neighbors, neighborhood dogs and spots for groceries. “I like to go get bread from the bakery and get cheese from the cheese shop, as opposed to just doing it all at one store,” he said. Mr. Elgarten is starting to feel like a full-fledged New Jerseyan, he said. “I’ve definitely gotten more into Jersey City, and Jersey as a whole, since this hit.” Many have left a “sixth borough” to go deeper into the Jersey suburbs. Susan Maryanski, a sales agent with Keller Williams Realty, spent the summer helping clients list their Hoboken and Jersey City properties and look for bigger homes in Montclair, Summit, Madison, and Chatham. Michele Farrell, a broker associate for Liberty Realty, noted that the number of available Jersey City and Hoboken rentals nearly tripled this summer from the same time last year, but that bigger rentals with outdoor space were still getting snapped up, often by locals looking for upgrades. Jo De Maeyer Vermeiren and her husband, Thomas, recently decamped for the suburbs. Although they both loved Jersey City’s proximity to Manhattan’s bars, restaurants, theaters and operas, everything changed in March. Suddenly they were alone in their high-rise near the waterfront with two small children and a dog. “It quickly became depressing and claustrophobic,” Ms. De Maeyer Vermeiren, 38, said. The family started to look for homes in the suburbs, ultimately moving into a rental with a backyard in Short Hills in July. “I felt like something fell off my shoulders,” Ms. De Maeyer Vermeiren said. “I was finally able to breathe again.” Not everyone has been OK making New Jersey their permanent home. Kareem McJagger, a drag performer and nightlife promoter who works in Downtown Manhattan, spent most of the spring shutdown in Hoboken on his fire escape, which he discovered was ideal for people-watching. But he felt isolated. Most of his friends live in the city and were suddenly out of reach. Mr. McJagger, 37, who is Black, also said that he feels conspicuous in Hoboken, where the population is more than 82 percent white. In July, Mr. McJagger temporarily relocated to Fire Island, on Long Island, to live with his long-distance boyfriend, who spends his summers there. Mr. McJagger returned to Hoboken in early October. Returning, he said, was “weird and stressful,” but for now, his plan is to stay put. Some local businesses and organizations have gotten a boost from the area’s suddenly robust weekday population. Stony Hill Gardens & Farm Market, located an hour west of the Hudson, reported an increase in its produce subscriptions in Hoboken and Jersey City as residents began to stay home and cook multiple meals per day. This summer, the sidewalk “streateries” of downtown Hoboken filled up with diners enjoying nachos and margaritas. Little City Books, an independent bookstore in downtown Hoboken, noticed an increase in foot traffic. Outdoor spaces in Hoboken and Jersey City are bustling. Hoboken residents often meet up in Pier A Park, sitting around on lawn chairs when it’s warm enough, or playing games of Spikeball. Personal trainers and their clients hoist kettlebells under Hoboken’s 14th Street Viaduct, and badminton and socially distanced gatherings continue in Hamilton Park in Jersey City well past dark. Dog parks in both towns now see a lunchtime rush. A few blocks east of Little City Books, Manhattan’s Financial District is visible across the water. This summer, Kate Jacobs, who owns the shop with Donna Garban, emailed a reading list to her customers called “I Miss New York.” Titles included “Go Tell It On the Mountain” by James Baldwin, “Going Into Town” by Roz Chast and “Bonfire of the Vanities” by Tom Wolfe. “I miss it,” she wrote in an accompanying note. “How can I miss the Port Authority? I want to be on a stinky subway platform.” The feedback from readers, Ms. Jacobs said, was sharply divided. While some readers wrote back that they, too, felt wistful about even the most unsavory parts of the city, “Some said, ‘I don’t miss New York at all.’” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
