By Maggie Astor It’s not exactly hard to find election coverage: You can pretty much look in any direction and it’ll be there. But the volume can be its own obstacle, making it difficult to cut through the commotion and find the specific information you’re looking for. Here’s a guide to The Times’s coverage, no matter when, how or how often you want to consume it. There will be a results map on The New York Times’s home page throughout the night, with states colored blue or red as they are called for Joseph R. Biden Jr. or President Trump. You’ll be able to click on any state for more details. Unlike on Election Days past, however, uncalled states will not be colored light blue or pink based on who is leading. That’s because the huge partisan split this year between mail-in ballots and in-person ballots is likely to skew the early results. A lead for either party in the initial count may be very misleading, so states won’t be colored until they’re officially called. And yes, the infamous needle will be back — but only for Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, because they’re the only swing states that are providing granular enough information for our experts to make educated projections of uncounted votes. Times reporters are live-blogging all day and night. This will be your one-stop shop for minute-by-minute updates: race calls, on-the-ground reporting from swing states, news about any voting issues or disruptions, and more. Reporters will also be publishing frequent, brief analyses of how the night is unfolding. A separate group of Times journalists will be producing a live briefing from roughly 5 p.m. to 3 a.m. Eastern time. (Check back here at 5 for a link.) It will give you an overview of what’s happening in a variety of areas: the presidential race, Senate races, House races and the voting process itself.
