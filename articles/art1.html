Kovaleski KIRKLAND, Wash. — After months of near-isolation inside his senior care facility, Charlie no longer recognizes his wife of almost 50 years. In another nursing home, Susan’s toenails grew so long that she could not squeeze into her shoes. Ida lost 37 pounds and stopped speaking. Minnie cried and asked God to just take her. They are among thousands of older people stricken by another epidemic ravaging America’s nursing homes — an outbreak of loneliness, depression and atrophy fueled by the very lockdowns that were imposed to protect them from the coronavirus. “A slow killer,” said Esther Sarachene, who said she watched her 82-year-old mother, Ida Pasik, wither and fall mute during the months she was confined to her nursing home room in Maryland. “She didn’t know who I was.” Covid-19 continues to scythe through the halls of long-term care facilities despite an array of safety measures and bans on visitors, put in place months ago to slow the devastation. More than 87,000 residents and workers have died of the virus, which has infected more than half a million people tied to facilities, and new clusters continue to erupt with numbing regularity: 16 people reported dead this month at a nursing home in Chesterfield, Va.; all 62 residents of a Kansas nursing home infected. At the same time, the damage of solitude is being overlooked, families and advocacy groups say. They say that widespread lockdowns are still necessary to protect people from the virus, but also that facilities must now confront a growing physical and mental toll of social isolation as the pandemic shows no sign of abating. Separation from family and friends is among the hardest deprivations of the pandemic. Experts say the absence can inflict particularly serious damage on people with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, thousands of whom have been confined to their buildings since March. Operators of long-term care facilities say they are facing an impossible choice between depriving residents of vital human contact and inviting the virus inside. “We have to walk a very fine line,” said Robin Dale, president of the Washington Health Care Association, a trade group that has noted a recent uptick in virus cases in the state’s facilities amid a new surge nationally. “We need to work toward more in-person visits, but it is difficult right now.” In more than two dozen interviews across the country, long-term care employees described increased confusion, anger and anxiety among residents. Family members said their relatives were deteriorating in short-staffed facilities that have pared back physical therapy, exercise classes and visits into the community. One worker described how a resident told her one evening that she was the first person she had seen all day. “Mom’s just not there,” said Deanna Williams, as she and two siblings headed to the Life Care Center of Kirkland, Wash., to visit their 89-year-old mother, Peggy Walsh, who loved motoring around the country before she developed dementia. Life Care, in suburban Seattle, was the nation’s first Covid-19 hot spot in February, a place that gave a first glimpse at how the virus could tear through homes. Forty-six Life Care residents have died. Since the outbreak, as the deaths of residents of long-term care facilities swelled to account for almost 40 percent of the country’s 229,600 coronavirus deaths, Ms. Walsh has spent each day sitting quietly in her wheelchair, facing the fence and bushes outside her room. She used to say “I love you” when her children visited and kissed her, but it has now been eight months since they have been able to touch her. Some days, she does not seem to notice when they wave through her bedroom window or dance around with decorative autumn scarecrows to catch her eye. “If we could just give her a hug or a kiss on the cheek,” another daughter, Colleen Mallory, said. “It’s like losing her again and again and again.” Life Care has continued to operate throughout the pandemic, though families say its population of 200 patients has ebbed. The initial outbreak that killed dozens of residents and sickened much of the staff has now faded, but families say they still get sporadic notifications of a new infection inside. As Ms. Walsh’s children chatted at a Starbucks before one morning’s visit, their phones suddenly buzzed in unison — it was a text message from Life Care reporting that one patient and three staff members had tested positive.
