By Helene Cooper, Eric Schmitt and Maggie Haberman WASHINGTON — President Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper on Monday, causing turmoil in the military’s leadership and potentially across the government at a time when Mr. Trump’s refusal to concede the election has created a potentially precarious transition. Mr. Trump announced the decision on Twitter, writing in an abrupt post that Mr. Esper had been “terminated.” The president wrote that he was appointing Christopher C. Miller, whom he described as the “highly respected” director of the National Counterterrorism Center, to be the acting defense secretary. Mr. Miller will be the fourth official to lead the Pentagon under Mr. Trump. Mr. Esper’s departure means that Mr. Miller would — if he lasts — see out the end of the Trump administration at the Pentagon. While Mr. Trump has over two months left in office, it could still be a significant time: Defense Department officials have privately expressed worries that the president might initiate operations, whether overt or secret, again Iran or other adversaries during his waning days in office. “Seventy-two days is a lifetime in Trump’s Washington, especially at this rather treacherous moment where he’s lashing out about the election and looking for ways to exert and maintain power,” John Gans, who served as the chief speechwriter at the Pentagon during the Obama administration, said in an email. Mr. Esper’s downfall had been expected for months, after he took the rare step of disagreeing publicly with Mr. Trump in June and saying that active-duty military troops should not be sent to control the wave of protests in American cities. His firing was quickly followed by speculation that Mr. Trump was not finished: Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, and Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. director, could be next, according to administration officials. Removing these senior officials — in effect decapitating the national security bureaucracy during the uncertain time between administrations — is hardly without risks. But Mr. Trump enjoys firing people, two senior administration officials said on Monday. The looming end of his presidency, the officials said, gave him only two more months to exercise his privilege to fire. And by announcing the defense secretary’s ouster, Mr. Trump was seen as seeking to reclaim even a bit of the postelection narrative, which has been dominated by President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory. The defense secretary was aware that he was likely to be fired, but Pentagon officials said he hoped to continue serving as long as possible to sustain orderly leadership of the Defense Department. Administration officials said Mr. Trump had expressed his ire over Mr. Esper in the Oval Office on Monday morning, and the White House gave Mr. Esper only a few minutes’ advance notice of his firing. In a two-page letter to Mr. Trump obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Esper said, “I serve the country in deference to the Constitution, so I accept your decision to replace me.” Democrats immediately said Mr. Trump’s removal of Mr. Esper could endanger national security. “President Trump’s decision to fire Secretary Esper out of spite is not just childish, it’s also reckless,” said Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington and the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. “It has long been clear that President Trump cares about loyalty above all else, often at the expense of competence, and during a period of presidential transition, competence in government is of the utmost importance.” Friends and colleagues of the new acting secretary praised Mr. Miller’s Army Special Forces background and counterterrorism credentials but expressed surprise that he had been elevated to such a senior position, even in a temporary capacity. And while he is not considered an ideologue, Mr. Miller does not have the stature to push back on any precipitous actions that Mr. Trump might press in his final weeks in office, colleagues said.
