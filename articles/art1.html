By Bill Pennington MAMARONECK, N.Y. — Bryson DeChambeau won the 2020 U.S. Open by six strokes as power trumped accuracy at Winged Foot Golf Club. He bettered 21-year-old Matthew Wolff to win the tournament, which was held without fans, on Sunday. DeChambeau shot the day’s only under-par round, a 3-under 67, and celebrated winning his first major tournament, pumping both arms enthusiastically after sinking his putt on the 18th green. Greeted with a video call from his parents at the clubhouse, DeChambeau choked back tears as the moment settled in. Major statement. 🏆💪@B_DeChambeau wins the @USOpenGolf by SIX. pic.twitter.com/nuzyeyXJd8 DeChambeau, 27, had taken a swashbuckler’s approach to Winged Foot, making and missing fairways at nearly equal measure. “If the ball goes as far as it usually does, I’m comfortable in the rough, because with a wedge or a short iron I can still get it to the green or to the front of the green,” he said after Friday’s 2-under 67. “That lowers the intimidation factor of the rough.” During golf’s coronavirus hiatus, DeChambeau threw himself into an extreme weight lifting routine that added 40 pounds to his physique, most of it in his upper body. Since, he routinely out-drives competitors by 50 yards or more on some holes.
