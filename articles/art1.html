Its roster of corporate clients — start-ups that offered free lunches, salespeople with round-table breakfasts — had all implemented work-from-home policies. Events and conferences were canceled for the foreseeable future. If Jessie Gould, the Ox Verte chief executive, hoped to keep her staff employed and her vendors paid, the only path through the pandemic, it seemed, was going to be retail sales. Instead of catering to offices, they would make deliveries to homes. In addition to ready-to-eat meals, they would sell grocery boxes that appealed to health-conscious consumers newly wanting (or forced) to cook. Ox Verte already had a website, but it wasn’t particularly well suited to taking individual orders, so to enable the pivot, the company put up a new online storefront using Shopify, an e-commerce platform based in Canada. Founded in Ottawa in 2006, Shopify started out as a simple maker of e-commerce websites. Store owners, instead of having to worry about all the technical complexities that go with processing payments, managing checkout flows and working with JavaScript, could upload some pictures of their wares to Shopify, set prices, provide their bank account information and start selling. Over the next 15 years, as e-commerce grew from novelty to part of daily life, Shopify grew with it. Today, it’s a public company with a market capitalization that exceeds $100 billion. Its products include Shopify Capital, which provides funding to merchants that use its platform, and Shop Pay, a checkout process for customers, which has more than 60 million users. Last year, it surpassed eBay to become the No. 2 e-commerce destination in the United States, according to Shopify, with nearly 6 percent of sales, compared to Amazon’s 37 percent. Unlike Amazon, which is an online marketplace where customers go to buy stuff, Shopify is a software platform visible only to merchants. You don’t go shopping on Shopify the way you do on Amazon; Shopify doesn’t list products directly on Shopify.com. Ox Verte used Shopify’s e-commerce software to handle payments and manage inventory. These features have made Shopify popular among “direct to consumer” brands that don’t want to share their profits or see their brand weakened on Amazon or other marketplaces run by a third party, like Wayfair or Walmart. “The whole spirit of the D.T.C. space is owning the relationship with the customer, having that direct line, and Shopify gives you that control much better than Amazon does,” says Paul Munford, an angel investor and the founder of the popular direct-to-consumer newsletter Lean Luxe. Though Shopify’s operations are by nature low-profile, the company’s success has made it a linchpin in what Ben Thompson, the author of the tech newsletter Stratechery, recently referred to as the “Anti-Amazon Alliance.” (Another member of the would-be alliance, whose name recognition probably resonates more than Shopify’s: Google Shopping.) In the last few years especially, Shopify has struck up partnerships with ad giants like Facebook and taken on the kind of real-world functions that Amazon dominates. The dream for businesses that sell online has long been to have the ability to offer things like two-day shipping, easy returns, premium customer service and overall operational efficiency without having to be on Amazon’s website. Except for established juggernauts like Nike, individual businesses seem unlikely to realize that vision. But in creating software infrastructure that can be shared between merchants, Shopify has not only strengthened the competitive prospects of existing e-commerce businesses; it has also facilitated the emergence of new ones — including, as it turns out, my own. In April, months after I started reporting this article, I left my full-time job as a software engineer with the intention of creating my own start-up. The plan had been to take some time to conduct user interviews and then figure out a product. But with the onset of the pandemic, my business partner and I saw an opportunity and decided to move immediately. We started an Asian grocery-delivery service, Mellow Groceries, that would let people shop from grocery suppliers in Flushing, Queens, many of which were only taking orders on the Chinese social-media app WeChat. And so I became a user of Shopify myself. It’s one thing to report on software as an abstraction and quite another to actually use it as a paying customer. Our experience with Shopify was impressive. We uploaded a spreadsheet of product information — images, prices, categories — picked a template for our digital storefront and out popped a fairly sophisticated-looking e-commerce website. There was already a checkout page, which was integrated with various payment providers. Customizable purchase and shipping confirmation emails could be sent automatically to customers. When an order came in, we would get an email alert. There was a dashboard to track the behavior of visitors to the site. Within two days, we were open for business. Like many other merchants, we were betting on the way Covid-19 was accelerating the spread of e-commerce generally to propel us specifically. It took eight years for e-commerce as a share of retail sales in the United States to grow to 12 percent from 5 percent. It took only the 12 weeks between March and June this year to reach 16 percent from 12 percent. In one sense, Amazon seems to be the biggest winner of the pandemic when it comes to shopping — the company’s stock price has been up by as much as 86 percent since the beginning of the year. But Shopify has benefited too: As supply chains evolved, wholesalers turned to retail sales and local businesses went online. (Through mid-November, Shopify’s stock price has risen 125 percent this year.) In the dark days of April and May, when even Amazon’s usual performance sputtered and those with Prime subscriptions faced delivery dates months into the future, consumers for the first time in years turned elsewhere — their neighborhood hardware store, their local fishmonger, the organic catering company that brought them lunch at the office — for e-commerce purchases. And they found that, often thanks to Shopify’s unseen capacities, the experience was actually pretty good. Which is not to say that Shopify is the panacea for businesses that want to be online. As my partner and I would discover, while Shopify solves some challenges of starting an e-commerce store, it leaves others unresolved. In a landscape where customer attention is the scarcest resource, Shopify’s very identity as a neutral platform and invisible infrastructure is perhaps both its greatest asset and its greatest limitation. The story of the last two decades in e-commerce has been, to a large extent, the story of Amazon’s rise, from humble reseller of books to default shopping destination and computing engine of the internet. Books have been written to explain its success, but the simplest answer lies in plain sight, in Amazon’s mission to be a place where customers can find anything they might want to buy online at the lowest possible prices. What will make customers happy? What will make them want to come back and buy again? The company has sought to address these questions again and again. When I buy something on Amazon, I know that it will be delivered for free and in a couple of days; if something is wrong with the purchase, I’ll be able to return it, no questions asked, without even a shipping label or packaging — I can just hand it over to U.P.S. All that convenience alone is worth the $119 annual Prime subscription. The pampering of Amazon’s customers has been a boon both to them and to Amazon, securing its dominance, but the merchants — the other panel of the triptych — have not fared as well. Since Amazon first opened up its marketplace in 1999 to third-party sellers, 1.7 million of them have signed up, drawn in by Amazon’s huge customer base, sales volumes and its ability to fulfill orders. That last service, Fulfillment by Amazon (F.B.A.), means that a company doesn’t even have to store, pick and pack its own inventory. Third-party sellers now account for about 60 percent of the commercial activity on Amazon; a big part of the reason Amazon can claim to be “the everything store” is because of these vendors. Yet their proliferation has, paradoxically, undercut what power they can exert. Individually, they have little brand recognition and little negotiating power against the marketplace. Today, if a business lists an article of clothing on Amazon for $50, Amazon gets $8.50 in commission; if the seller opts to advertise on the site, Amazon likely gets at least another $6.50. And if Fulfillment by Amazon is used, Amazon’s total cut gets closer to 40 percent. Amazon ships F.B.A. products in its own envelopes or brown boxes, highlights competing vendors on the site and charges extra for things like early reviews and dedicated account managers. Amazon monitors and collects pricing data and, until last year, prohibited sellers from offering their goods more cheaply elsewhere. (The company’s current policy says it monitors prices to prevent “practices that harm customer trust.”) One brand I had made plans to interview, upon hearing that I would be writing about the ways in which Shopify could compete with Amazon, decided it was no longer willing to talk to me. (Amazon says it has a “mutually beneficial relationship” with its third-party sellers and that “our interests are well aligned.”)
