But stations find it hard to quit them. By Alexis Soloski “Would you like to subscribe to public television or would you prefer a knee in the groin?” asks a reporter with a microphone. “I’m not quite sure,” a man in an unconvincing wig answers. This surreal exchange was part of a 1975 pledge spot for WTTW, Chicago’s PBS affiliate, created by and starring Graham Chapman and Terry Jones of “Monty Python’s Flying Circus,” which had made it to America the year before on public television. In most scenes, the interviewee gets the knee. Running a public television station has always meant asking viewers — viewers like you! — to give, generously. Over five decades, PBS stations have found ways to nudge, cajole, guilt-trip and straight-up beg potential supporters. (As methods go, threats of violence are rare.) Public television appeals have sweet-talked their way into episodes of “Seinfeld” and “The Simpsons.” When PBS presented its history of comedy, “Make ’Em Laugh,” in 2009, it opened the satire episode with Billy Crystal parodying pledge breaks. But for many stations, the pledge drive has become a brand-identity paradox. To attract the most money to support their mission of quality television, many stations diverge from their usual lineup and resort to pledge programming of more doubtful merit — infomercials, specials that promote pseudoscientific advice, music documentaries that exist just to push you to choose a six-CD set as your “thank you” gift. Some stations have more recently pushed back against lengthy, on-air pledge drives, but the ritual remains stubbornly popular, bringing in new subscribers while selling out DVDs of “Aging Backward 3.” The pledge break actually precedes PBS itself. In the 1960s, Hudson Stoddard, a vice president at WNET, New York City’s then-fledgling public television station, went on-air himself to ask viewers for donations. During PBS’s earliest years, affiliate stations, which WNET soon became, handled fund-raising on an individual basis. But in 1975, PBS created its first coordinated pledge drive, “Festival 75,” offering special programs like “The 1975 Ski Jumping Championships,” “An Hour With Joan Baez,” “The Grover Monster-Jean Marsh Cartoon Special” (in which a Muppet and a creator and star of “Upstairs Downstairs” showcased animation from “Sesame Street” and “The Electric Company”). The event raised $5 million, which came to $6 million with matching grants (more than $24 million and $29 million in today’s dollars, respectively). During a drive, a station interrupts its programs with in-studio breaks, usually one per hour. Celebrities, national and local, stop by to proclaim their love for public media and plead for your support, while volunteers in the background answer phones. “Become a friend,” Frank Sinatra said during a 1979 break for the Las Vegas affiliate, kissing his pinkie-ringed hand and waving it toward the camera. The likes of Julia Child, Tony Bennett, Deepak Chopra and the male two thirds of Peter, Paul & Mary have all stopped in to chat on-air at various stations and take the occasional call. The format has persisted from decade to decade. Watch clips — YouTube has plenty — and you can see the same sorts of volunteers picking up the same sorts of phones on the floors of similar studios decked out with similar banners. Only the hairstyles change. (Barely.) But from the 1980s on, pledge drives have ballooned in frequency and length. Many affiliates hold four drives annually, most of them lasting multiple weeks. Some stations regularly spend a fifth of the broadcast calendar trying to generate donations. The reason? Donations from individuals keep stations afloat, providing on average a quarter of station revenues, much more at smaller stations. As Jerry Seinfeld said in the 1994 “Seinfeld” episode “The Pledge Drive” (the one where Jerry appears on a PBS affiliate and Kramer accidentally bankrupts Jerry’s grandmother), “There’s no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS.” In return for their generosity, viewers can choose a gift, typically station swag or a recorded program. In the ’80s, Stoddard developed the first station-logo tote bag, allowing donors to signal virtue as they schlepped groceries. Early bonuses like vinyl records and VHS tapes gave way to CDs and DVDs. “Sesame Street” dolls are available. Also socks patterned on Bob Ross’s happy trees. On the website of WDSE, the Duluth, Minn., affiliate, you can click through more than 46 pages of possible gifts. Nicole Stern, the membership director there, treasures her Mister Rogers heat change mug. “It’s a picture of Mister Rogers in his suit,” she said. “And then you pour a hot beverage in it and it magically transforms into his signature cardigan sweater.” The programming during pledge week favors a big-tent aesthetic that explicitly aims to entice new viewers. But that targeting skews very boomer. A sampling of programming from recent drives: “Fever: The Music of Peggy Lee,” “Suze Orman’s Ultimate Retirement Guide” and “Let’s Talk Menopause.” The PBS executives I spoke to trumpeted a few new offerings like “The Avett Brothers at Red Rocks” and a Prince special. “It’s not just about Andy Williams anymore,” Jerry Liwanag, the vice president of fund-raising programming, said. But it is still mostly about Andy Williams. And Neil Diamond. And John Tesh. And Paul Simon. Simon, however, isn’t really the problem. Concerts like his and specials like “Riverdance 25th Anniversary Show” and “Downton Abbey Live!” remain on brand for PBS. But affiliates also schedule shows of more dubious value, like nostalgia-driven music retrospectives and health-and-wellness content that “Nova” fans might wonder at, like “How to Live Forever With Gary Null.” Some of these shows are produced by PBS itself. Affiliates acquire others from private distributors. “Not every program that they acquire would be something that we would deal with at a national level,” Liwanag said diplomatically.
