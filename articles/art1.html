Officer Is Accused of Spying on Tibetans for China<br></h1><p id="artcont">Prosecutors said the officer told Chinese consulate officials that he could provide sensitive information about the internal operations of the Police Department. By Nicole Hong Federal prosecutors on Monday charged a New York City police officer with acting as an illegal agent of the Chinese government, accusing him of providing intelligence about Tibetans living in the United States to officials at the Chinese consulate. The officer, Baimadajie Angwang, 33, was taken into custody on Monday, officials said. He has served as a patrol officer and most recently worked as a community affairs officer in the 111th precinct in Queens. A 25-page criminal complaint unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn accused Mr. Angwang of reporting on the activities of ethnic Tibetans in New York at the behest of Chinese government officials, who were seeking to recruit intelligence sources in the community.   He also is accused of inviting a Chinese official to N.Y.P.D. events, offering potential access to senior police officials, prosecutors said. The allegations raised serious questions about how much visibility Chinese government officials had inside the country’s largest police department and about the extent of Chinese efforts to conduct covert surveillance of Tibetan Americans. Born in China, Mr. Angwang is a naturalized U.S. citizen who is ethnically Tibetan. In addition to being a police officer — he was once named “Cop of the Month” — he is a staff sergeant in the Army Reserve, where he had a “secret”-level security clearance, allowing him access to classified information, prosecutors said.
