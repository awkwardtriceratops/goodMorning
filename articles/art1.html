By Nate Cohn Joe Biden looks to be on the cusp of winning the election. Here’s a look at where the vote count stands in the key states. President Trump’s lead in Pennsylvania has plummeted to two percentage points as of Thursday morning, as the mail absentee ballot count proceeded briskly across the state. There is every indication that Mr. Biden remains on track to pull ahead when all of the votes are in and counted, whenever that may be. So far, Mr. Biden has been winning absentee votes, 77 percent to 22 percent, according to the Pennsylvania secretary of state. At that pace, he needs only 288,000 more mail votes before taking the lead. By my count, there are about 500,000 mail ballots left. The secretary of state reported a total of 2.6 million absentee ballots cast as of Tuesday, and so far 2.1 million absentee votes have been counted. If Mr. Biden won those 500,000 ballots by the same 77-22 pace, he would end with a lead of about 100,000 votes in the state. That’s a pretty decent cushion. That estimate may also be conservative. For one, the remaining mail ballots are disproportionately in Democratic counties, so he’ll probably do better than 77-22. Another factor: There are more remaining absentee votes than estimated here; the state tally as of Tuesday does not include mail ballots postmarked by Election Day that arrived afterward (and I’m not entirely sure whether it includes mail ballots placed in Election Day drop boxes, but I’m assuming so out of caution). To that point, the Pennsylvania election web page says there are 763,000 mail ballots left to be counted. I think that’s mainly because it’s out of date, and additional mail ballots have been counted since the page was last updated. But it may also reflect additional mail ballots. It might also be both. And finally, there are still Election Day ballots left in Philadelphia, as well as provisional ballots — votes cast by people who couldn’t initially be verified as eligible voters when they showed up to cast a ballot, like someone who went to the wrong precinct — that will cushion Mr. Biden. The provisional count might be especially large here this year, since voters who requested a mail ballot but decided to vote in person (and didn’t surrender their mail ballot in person) were also forced to vote provisionally, so as to make sure their votes weren’t double-counted. If you want a gut check on the big picture, look at the swing map on our results page, which shows how things have changed since 2016 in the counties where we think the vote is done. In the places where the count has mostly wrapped up, Mr. Biden is mostly running ahead of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 showing — and often by a significant margin.
