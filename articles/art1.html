By H. Samy Alim and Geneva Smitherman Dr. Alim and Dr. Smitherman are the authors of “Articulate While Black: Barack Obama, Language, and Race in the U.S.” After Joe Biden announced that he had selected Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, Bernie Sanders praised her in an interview on MSNBC: “I will tell you that Kamala is very smart, very aggressive,” he said. And then he delivered the inevitable, racialized compliment that makes many African-Americans cringe: “very articulate.” Just a few days earlier, on MSNBC, Steve Schmidt, the former Republican strategist, called Ms. Harris is “a formidable political leader in this country,” adding: “She’s smart. She’s quick on her feet. She’s articulate.” With this description, both men echoed Todd Gloria, a candidate for San Diego mayor, who said in an interview with News 8 on Aug. 11, “She is someone who is incredibly smart, very articulate.” Bob Mulholland, a Democratic superdelegate from California, declared outside of his home on the same day, “In the era of social media, you got to have someone who looks good on television and is articulate and intelligent, and that fits Kamala Harris.” Writing in The Week in December, Damon Linker called her “the total package. Smart, articulate, sassy, attractive.”
