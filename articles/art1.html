The Pandemic Changed That.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Hoboken and Jersey City, often nicknamed the “sixth boroughs” of New York City, have their residents back full time. By Ashley Fetters When Mikey Miller, an aspiring actor and theater writer, moved to Jersey City in May 2019, he expected to live there only in the most technical sense. His address would be in New Jersey, but his livelihood would be in New York City, and for the first 10 months, his plan worked perfectly: He commuted to Manhattan on the PATH train almost every day to see and review Broadway productions, audition for shows, and tutor high-school students. But when the coronavirus outbreak descended on the East Coast in March, closing theaters and schools and sending New Yorkers into isolation, Mr. Miller, 24, had no reason to visit the city anymore. Unsure of what else to do, he began wandering around Jersey City on foot. Sometimes, he stopped in front of closed restaurants to peer inside and read the menus posted in their windows. He discovered how peaceful Liberty State Park was. For someone who had once dreamed of relocating to Manhattan’s Upper East Side, he was beginning to enjoy what he thought was his starter neighborhood. “If I were to make my residence ultimately in downtown Jersey City,” he said, “I would have no problem with that.” For decades, Hoboken and Jersey City, long in competition to be New York City’s honorary “sixth borough,” have served urbanites like Mr. Miller, who sleep in New Jersey but spend most of their waking hours across the Hudson River. As recently as this past February, more than 68,000 commuters from Jersey City and Hoboken boarded the PATH train that connects the two cities to Manhattan every weekday morning, and still more commuted by ferry or bus. Certainly, some of those residents were taking the PATH to other destinations in New Jersey — but in 2014, the population of Hudson County (home to Hoboken, Jersey City, and 10 other municipalities) was found to shrink by 40,000 during the day.
