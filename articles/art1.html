Inquiry, but Only After Election<br></h1><p id="artcont">Mr. Trump’s lawyers said in a court filing that he was willing to be interviewed by investigators after voters cast their presidential ballots. By Ed Shanahan Two months after he abruptly canceled a previous session, Eric Trump is now ready to be interviewed under oath as part of an investigation by New York’s attorney general into the financing of his family company’s properties — but only after the presidential election. In a court filing on Thursday, lawyers for the company, the Trump Organization, expressed Mr. Trump’s willingness to comply with the inquiry by the attorney general, Letitia James. But while Mr. Trump is prepared to answer questions from lawyers with Ms. James’s office, he does not want to do so before Nov. 3, Election Day, because of an “extreme travel schedule” and “to avoid the use of his deposition attendance for political purposes,” the filing says. Mr. Trump — who, according to messages posted on Twitter, made campaign stops on behalf of his father, President Trump, in New Hampshire and Maine on Thursday — had offered four possible dates after the election to be interviewed, the filing says. “We respectfully submit that the proposed dates are reasonable,” the Trump Organization lawyers wrote. Ms. James appeared unmoved by Mr. Trump’s latest offer of cooperation. “We won’t allow any entity or individual to dictate how our investigation will proceed or allow anyone to evade a lawful subpoena,” she said in a statement. “No one is above the law, period.” The filing on Thursday came after Ms. James, who is exploring whether the Trump Organization committed fraud by inflating its assets to get loans and tax benefits, asked a judge to order Mr. Trump to answer questions under oath and to also compel the company to hand over documents. Ms. James, a Democrat, sought the order after Mr. Trump, an executive vice president at the company who is now running its day-to-day operations, pulled out of an interview with her office in July, and the company said that it and its lawyers would not comply with seven subpoenas. Last year, Ms. James reached a settlement with the president under which he admitted misusing money from a personal foundation to promote his campaign and pay off business debt. Her current inquiry is one of several legal actions he and his company are facing. The Manhattan district attorney’s office has suggested in court filings that it is investigating possible financial crimes and insurance fraud by the president and the Trump Organization, and is fighting in federal court to obtain his tax returns. The president is also being sued for defamation by the writer E. Jean Carroll in a case that the Justice Department, in an unusual step, recently moved to take over from his private lawyers. Ms. James’s inquiry began last year after the president’s former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, told Congress that Mr. Trump had overstated the value of his assets in financial statements when seeking loans from banks and had understated them to reduce real estate taxes. The investigation is focused on a number of Trump properties, including several that came up during Mr. Cohen’s congressional testimony. The Seven Springs estate in Westchester County, N.Y., the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, 40 Wall Street in Lower Manhattan and the Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles, were the subject of the subpoenas. Court documents released last month suggested there were concerns within the Trump Organization that Ms. James’s inquiry could develop from a civil matter into a criminal one. Two days before Eric Trump was to answer questions under oath, the papers said, the company canceled the session, with its lawyers expressing concern that the investigation was going “beyond the scope” of a civil inquiry. The attorney general’s office subsequently assured the company that it had not referred the case to “another criminal law enforcement agency.”
