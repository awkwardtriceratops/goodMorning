By Neil MacFarquhar, Mike Baker and Adam Goldman Inside an apartment on a quiet suburban street near Lacey, Wash., on Thursday evening, Michael Forest Reinoehl fretted about his future. He talked about his children in a telephone call to a friend, wondering how to keep them safe should anything happen to him. Outside, the F.B.I. kept watch. Moments later, U.S. Marshals and local law enforcement agents, with an arrest affidavit that accused Mr. Reinoehl of the shooting death last week of a far-right activist, raced toward the brick apartment building in two S.U.V.s. Mr. Reinoehl, 48, a self-identified proponent of Antifa and a regular presence at the long-running protests against racial injustice in Portland, had seemed to confess to the killing in an interview with a journalist released hours earlier. He also said that he feared being killed in custody. Soon after he emerged from the apartment, he was dead, shot and killed by law enforcement agents. The U.S. Marshals Service said in a statement that Mr. Reinoehl was armed with a handgun when they arrived and threatened the lives of officers. But many details remain unknown, including whether Mr. Reinoehl fired any shots before or after several law enforcement officers opened fire. Lt. Ray Brady of the Thurston County Sheriff’s Office said he was not aware of any video footage of the shooting, including from body cameras. On Thursday evening, as Mr. Reinoehl lay dead in the street, police radios crackled with reports that shots had been fired. “Someone, the caller, hysterical saying someone opened fire and a female is screaming,” said one dispatcher, according to a transcript of the police transmissions. Jashon Spencer, who lives nearby, said he went outside after hearing gunshots and saw a bloodied man in the street. A video he filmed showed a law enforcement officer attempting first aid. Portland police had issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Reinoehl in the killing of Aaron J. Danielson, a supporter of a far-right group who was shot dead last Saturday after participating in a pro-Trump caravan and then taking to the streets of downtown Portland, where members of the caravan and their opponents clashed. In an affidavit from Mr. Reinoehl’s arrest warrant, released Friday, authorities describe surveillance footage showing Mr. Reinoehl and Mr. Danielson first walking along a sidewalk, apparently without confrontation. Mr. Danielson was already carrying a can in one hand — possibly mace — and what appears to be an expandable baton in the other. The footage shows Mr. Reinoehl turned into a parking garage, reached into a pouch or waistband, and waited for Mr. Danielson and a friend to pass, according to the documents. Authorities said Mr. Reinoehl followed the two men as they crossed the street in the seconds before the shooting. Both Mr. Reinoehl and Mr. Danielson had been stalwarts in the long-running street battles there pitting leftist demonstrators against various far-right groups. In a news conference on Friday, Mr. Trump thanked the U.S. Marshals Service for their “strength” and “bravery,” saying that Mr. Reinoehl was killed after drawing a weapon when officers attempted to take him into custody. Mr. Trump has deployed federal officers to the city and has threatened to do so again, while the city’s Democratic leaders have said the federal agents are aggravating the violence. “You have this kind of culture where the right-wing vigilantes, though much smaller in number, are better armed and are calling for violence,” said Joseph Lowndes, a professor of political science at the University of Oregon. Whenever they appear, they are inevitably confronted by Antifa or other anti-fascist movements in Portland, and, he said, “you end up with this cycle of continuing confrontations.” After the killing of George Floyd in police custody sparked protests and unrest across the country this summer, U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr formed a task force to investigate violent anti-government extremists. The F.B.I. has opened hundreds of investigations related to extremist activity, but has predominantly charged those on the far right. Yet in his public statements, Mr. Barr has pinned the violence on leftist groups and movements, particularly Antifa, and echoed assertions by President Trump that people on the left are inciting violent riots. On Friday, in a statement, he characterized Mr. Reinoehl as a “dangerous fugitive” and a “violent agitator.” Friends and relatives described Mr. Reinoehl, a former professional snowboarder and father of two, as someone who had strongly held political beliefs. He relished his allegiance to Antifa, a loose alliance of activists, some of whom clashed with police during volatile street demonstrations throughout the summer. “I am 100% ANTIFA all the way!” he wrote in a June Instagram post. His sister suggested the cause may have given him a sense of purpose, after his snowboarding career dwindled and he grew estranged from his family. “It made him feel like his existence meant something again,” she said.
