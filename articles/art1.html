By Ben Smith David J. Pecker, the tabloid media titan who drew the scrutiny of federal investigators for his alleged role in Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, is out as the leader of the parent company of The National Enquirer, Us Weekly and other publications, according to a company announcement on Friday. At the same time, American Media, the company led by Mr. Pecker since 1999, has a new name, A360Media, and will be merged with a sibling company, Accelerate 360. Both are controlled by the hedge fund Chatham Asset Management. The chief executive of Accelerate 360, David Parry, announced the changes to employees on Friday. The company, based in Smyrna, Ga., describes itself as a logistics firm that delivers products “from corkscrews to umbrellas.” Accelerate said Mr. Pecker, 68, the chief executive and president of American Media, would take on a new role, executive adviser. Under his leadership, The Enquirer sometimes moved away from its usual coverage of Hollywood celebrities and reality television stars to bolster the candidacy of Mr. Trump and attack his political foes, including Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton. In 2016, Mr. Pecker and his associates helped orchestrate a deal involving a woman who claimed a past affair with Mr. Trump: the former Playboy model Karen McDougal. In a piece of tabloid tradecraft known as “catch and kill,” an article on the alleged affair was never published. Federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York investigated American Media’s hush payments as a possible violation of campaign finance laws. They ended up giving Mr. Pecker a nonprosecution deal for his cooperation, which included an admission that American Media had paid Ms. McDougal with the intention of aiding Mr. Trump’s 2016 election prospects. Last year, The Enquirer made news again when it was accused of “extortion and blackmail” by Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, who has been the target of name-calling by Mr. Trump on Twitter. Mr. Bezos, the world’s richest man, accused the supermarket tabloid after it devoted 11 pages of its Jan. 28, 2019, issue to an exposé of his extramarital affair with Lauren Sanchez, a Los Angeles television personality. In a lengthy post on the digital platform Medium, Mr. Bezos singled out Mr. Pecker in his headline: “No thank you, Mr. Pecker!” In the text that followed, he accused American Media of having threatened to publish graphic photographs of himself, including a “below-the-belt selfie,” if he did not publicly affirm that The Enquirer’s reporting on his affair had not been motivated by political concerns. In April 2019, after the dispute with Mr. Bezos, American Media announced that it had sold The Enquirer to James Cohen, a son of the founder of the Hudson News franchise of newspaper and magazine shops. That deal has not closed. Chatham, the principal owner of American Media, had pushed Mr. Pecker to sell The Enquirer after the publication found itself under federal scrutiny. Chatham, a New Jersey hedge fund, is led by Anthony Melchiorre, a Chicago-area native who has earned a reputation on Wall Street as a tough negotiator. Mr. Melchiorre manages more than $4 billion in assets for clients through various funds, including some listed under an address in the Cayman Islands, where more favorable tax rates apply. The hedge fund recently took ownership of the McClatchy Company, a large and prestigious newspaper chain, after a bankruptcy auction. McClatchy runs 30 news outlets across the country, including The Sacramento Bee and The Miami Herald. Mr. Pecker’s brand of journalism makes for an incongruous fit with McClatchy, which has won a raft of Pulitzer Prizes in its 163-year history. The news release announcing the merger of American Media (that is, A360Media) and Accelerate did not include a mention of Chatham. In an internal memo on Friday, Mr. Parry told employees that “the unexpected economic impact that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on magazine newsstand sales have accelerated the discussions and made the American Media/Accelerate integration necessary.” The coronavirus pandemic has harmed many publications, but it was particularly damaging to American Media, whose publications — especially its flagship, The Enquirer — rely on sales at supermarket checkout counters, newsstands and airport shops like Hudson News. Mr. Pecker was raised in the Bronx and educated at Pace University in that borough. The school gave him an honorary doctorate in 1998 and later established a distinguished professorship in his honor. In the 1990s, before he was a tabloid titan, Mr. Pecker was a swaggering Manhattan media executive who ran Hachette Filipacchi Magazines, then the home of the fashion glossy Elle, the movie magazine Premiere and the political-and-lifestyle monthly George, a publication edited by John F. Kennedy Jr.
