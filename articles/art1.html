By Jenny Gross The California Supreme Court on Monday overturned the death penalty for Scott Peterson, who was found guilty in 2004 of killing his pregnant wife, Laci, in a notorious case that became fodder for the tabloids and cable news and spawned at least one made-for-TV movie. The court upheld Mr. Peterson’s conviction, but it said that the trial judge made mistakes that had hindered his right to an impartial jury during sentencing. “We reject Peterson’s claim that he received an unfair trial as to guilt and thus affirm his convictions for murder,” the court said. “But before the trial began, the trial court made a series of clear and significant errors in jury selection that, under longstanding United States Supreme Court precedent, undermined Peterson’s right to an impartial jury at the penalty phase.” The court said prosecutors could again seek the death penalty for Mr. Peterson at a new hearing. Prospective jurors whose views on capital punishment would impair their ability to follow the law could be dismissed as unqualified, the court said. But jurors could not be dismissed simply for having expressed opposition to the death penalty. “Here, the trial court erroneously dismissed many prospective jurors because of written questionnaire responses expressing opposition to the death penalty, even though the jurors gave no indication that their views would prevent them from following the law — and, indeed, specifically attested in their questionnaire responses that they would have no such difficulty,” the court said. “Under United States Supreme Court precedent, these errors require us to reverse the death sentence in this case.” Mr. Peterson’s lawyer, Mark Geragos, welcomed the decision. “Obviously, if you death-qualify jurors in a case like this, that’s going to give you a jury with a pro-prosecution bent,” he said. He added that the justices should have gone further and overturned Mr. Peterson’s conviction. “If you say that jury selection is fundamentally flawed,” he said, “how can you say that the guilty verdict is not fundamentally flawed?” During the 2004 trial, the prosecution argued that Mr. Peterson, of Modesto, Calif., killed his wife, a substitute teacher, so he could carry on a relationship with another woman, Amber Frey. Laci Peterson, 27, was reported missing from their home on Dec. 24, 2002, and her body and her fetus were found four months later in San Francisco Bay. The baby, whom the couple had decided to name Conner, was due in February 2003. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
