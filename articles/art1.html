Even the Oyster Bar Can’t Survive.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Since March, 77 of the 321 retail businesses still operating in the subway system have permanently closed, according to the transit agency. By Christina Goldbaum Even as trains sat mostly empty and silence filled Vanderbilt Hall, for one day it felt like a time capsule in a corner of Grand Central Terminal: The station’s famed Oyster Bar, which had shuttered for seven months because of pandemic restrictions, had reopened and 80 of its 81 reservations slots were filled. Inside bartenders sloshed cocktails, shuckers pried open shells and regulars slid onto leather chairs in a scene familiar since the restaurant opened in 1913. But the liveliness was fleeting. As days passed, the flood of customers dwindled to a trickle. Then, only two weeks after the restaurant reopened, it closed. For over a century, the New York City subway has served as the backbone of the city’s economy, shuttling riders to workplaces and tourists to famed sightseeing spots. At the same time, the system spawned its own economic ecosystem of businesses sustained by the millions of people traipsing through stations every day. But when the pandemic decimated ridership, those establishments lost almost all their customers, dealing a blow at least as devastating, if not worse, as the pain the outbreak has inflicted on businesses above ground. The number of transit-linked businesses, from newsstands and hot dog vendors to florists and shoe shiners, had already been in steady decline as print newspapers lost favor and tighter regulations meant to make the subway system cleaner and less cluttered shut down stores. Now the prolonged period of low ridership has made the situation even worse. Since March, 77 of the 321 retail businesses still operating in the system have permanently closed, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city’s subway. “How do we survive?” said Jairo Cardenas, 62, a cobbler who runs a shoe shine shop along the Eighth Avenue stretch of the Times Square station, typically one of the system’s busiest stops. “We don’t have tourists, people are all working from home. We have nothing.” At the Oyster Bar, Sandy Ingber, the executive chef and a co-owner, was optimistic during the initial rush of old customers excited to finally visit. But within days, the flurry of reservations dried up. As dinners dwindled, the staff did too. First to be let go were the waiters, then some cooks. Mr. Ingber fought to keep his last shucker — it is an oyster bar after all — but soon even he was laid off. “It’s just not sustainable,” Mr. Ingber, 66, said.  “Until we have more foot traffic in Grand Central we just can’t do it.” He is not sure when the restaurant might reopen. “People are very worried about going into restaurants indoors, much less going into a train station,” he said. In an effort to keep remaining shops open, the transit agency adopted a plan last week to offer long-term rent relief, adjusting rents to reflect current sales until business returns to normal. “We want to make sure when the system comes back, we haven’t lost all the amenities for our customers,” said Janno Lieber, the head of the authority’s capital construction. Still, some shop owners say with subway ridership at just 30 percent of normal levels — and unlikely to rebound to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon as more businesses keep their workers home — rent relief may not be enough to keep them afloat. “Without people coming back to offices, we are dead,” said Dominick Abruscato, 72, who owns the Royal Barber Shop at the Fulton Street station in Lower Manhattan. Since 1937, business executives and other workers have sought out this unassuming corner of the station for a haircut. In recent years, many have come specifically to see Mr. Abruscato, an Italian immigrant who began cutting hair when he was 8, turned professional when he was 14 and began working in the shop 40 years ago. “I don’t even have hair anymore and I wouldn’t go elsewhere,” said the shop’s lone client, John Silverman, 71, as he sat in Mr. Abruscato’s barber chair one recent afternoon. Like all other nonessential businesses in the city, the shop closed for three months this spring during New York’s initial lockdown. The first three days after he reopened in June were hectic, Mr. Abruscato said. Around 45 clients booked appointments each day. But after that, the cascade of daily customers slowed to two or three. “I’m trying,” he said. “I’m trying to stick around, but I don’t know what’s going to happen.”
