With a Chance to Rescue His Legacy From Trump<br></h1><p id="artcont">After four years watching his achievements being dismantled, he has almost as much at stake as his party’s nominee, Joe Biden, does. By Peter Baker Shortly before the 2016 election, President Barack Obama told supporters that he would consider it “a personal insult” if America chose a bombastic reality television star who trafficked in racist conspiracy theories and stood against everything that he had spent eight years building. America did it anyway. “This stings,” Mr. Obama confessed afterward. Four years later, Mr. Obama returns to the national stage on Wednesday night seeking vindication. After watching President Trump systematically demolish many of his achievements, Mr. Obama has almost as much at stake in this year’s campaign as his former vice president and his party’s 2020 presidential nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr., does — a second chance to redeem his legacy and prove to history that Mr. Trump’s election was an anomaly, not a permanent repudiation.
