By Aleha Landry and Sarah Streyder Ms. Landry is a military spouse living in Colorado. Ms. Streyder is the founder and director of the Secure Families Initiative, and is also a military spouse. Politically, we don’t agree on much. One of us is a libertarian-leaning conservative, and the other a left-leaning progressive. But we are both active duty Air Force spouses who have found friendship through our common lives. We both work to shepherd our loved ones through long deployments, and are fluent in the sarcastic humor needed to weather military life. And even though we plan to vote for different candidates this fall, we’ll both be casting our ballots the same way: by mail. In 2018, the military sent Sarah’s family halfway across the country from where she was registered to vote. So she did what over half a million military family voters did last presidential election, she voted by mail. Aleha has voted in person only once during a presidential election. She has mailed her ballots since 2004. The ability to cast a ballot from across the world has been an essential tool for the military community to continue participating in democracy. With the limitations on mobility caused by Covid-19, expanding vote-by-mail is essential to enabling participation among civilians this November, just as it has worked for decades for the military. Yet this practice has become politically controversial. Just two weeks ago, President Trump claimed that mail-in voting would make this election “inaccurate & fraudulent” and would be “a great embarrassment to the USA.” This week he used his opposition to vote-by-mail as justification to oppose funding the postal service. But voting by mail shouldn’t be viewed as partisan. During this pandemic, it’s the best way to enable participation in the election while protecting public health.
