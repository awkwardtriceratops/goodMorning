By Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Fatima Faizi KABUL, Afghanistan — Gunmen laid siege to Afghanistan’s largest university on Monday, killing at least 19 people and wounding more than a dozen others, officials said, as rising violence in the Afghan capital resulted in carnage at an educational center for the second time in just over a week. The attack at Kabul University on a warm fall day dragged on for hours as Afghan forces and U.S. troops moved to root out the gunmen, who had quickly spread across campus, detonating explosives and firing their weapons. Video and photographs posted to social media showed students scrambling for cover and clambering over walls to get to safety. Sporadic gunshots echoed in the background. Fardin Ahmadi, a social science student, said he was stuck in his classroom for two hours, until Afghan forces evacuated him and several others. “The situation was very bad,” Mr. Ahmadi said. “Every single student wanted to save their own life; we had forgotten about anything else.” The exact number of dead and wounded was murky, as the attackers were still barricading themselves in classrooms four hours after the first shots rang out. Obaidullah Meraj, a doctor at the Ali Abad hospital, said that ambulances had transferred several wounded people, including students and professors from the university. More than 20 students and faculty members were held hostage at one point during the siege. “During the attack on Kabul University, unfortunately, 19 were killed and 22 others were wounded,” said Tariq Arian, a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior.
