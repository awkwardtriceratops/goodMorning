Real-time captioning is available during the live event. Every year, book lovers look forward to the publication of the 10 Best Books list, chosen by the editors of The Times Book Review. But this year, Times subscribers have a chance to know these titles before other readers do. On the morning of Nov. 23, the Book Review will announce the 10 Best Books of 2020 as part of a live virtual event, ahead of the list’s publication that day. The editor of the Book Review, Pamela Paul, along with her colleagues will offer a look inside the process of creating this year’s list, as well as share some personal favorite books that didn’t quite make the final cut. The actor, producer and author Mindy Kaling will introduce the event, which will be followed by questions and answers from the audience. You can R.S.V.P. for the event here, and submit your questions about the 10 Best Books here. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
