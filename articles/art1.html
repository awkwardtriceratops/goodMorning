It Didn’t Work Out.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Federal officials relied too heavily on the tests, then took the results for granted, experts say. By Katherine J. Wu After months of crowded events and often maskless encounters, a growing number of top government officials, including President Trump, and their close contacts have tested positive for the coronavirus. The fault for the outbreak lies in no small part with an ill-conceived disease-prevention strategy at the White House, health experts said: From the early days of the pandemic, federal officials have relied too heavily on one company’s rapid tests, with little or no mechanism to identify and contain cases that fell through the diagnostic cracks. “It seems the White House put all their eggs in one basket: testing,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency medicine physician at Brown University. “But there is no single strategy, no single thing we can do to be safe. It has to be multimodal.” Other health experts noted that the tests deployed by the White House, manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, were given emergency clearance by the Food and Drug Administration only for people “within the first seven days of the onset of symptoms.” But they were used incorrectly, to screen people who were not showing any signs of illness. Such off-label use, experts said, further compromised a strategy that presumably was designed to keep leading officials safe from a pandemic that so far has killed more than 210,000 Americans. “It’s not being used for the intended purpose,” said Syra Madad, an infectious disease epidemiologist based in New York. “So there will be potentially a lot of false negatives and false positives.” Abbott’s rapid coronavirus tests, called the ID NOW and BinaxNOW, are speedy, portable and easy to operate, delivering results in minutes. But the convenience comes at a cost: The products are less accurate than laboratory tests that use a technique called polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., and they more frequently miss infections or mistakenly designate healthy people as infected, as happened to Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio in August. During the course of the pandemic, the Trump administration has relied on rapid coronavirus tests, including one that had been found to sometimes miss infections. Nonetheless, shortly after Abbott’s ID NOW test received emergency approval from the F.D.A. in the spring, the White House adopted it as a rapid screening tool for staff members and visitors who came into close contact with the president. Sometime around the end of August or early September, the White House switched to using the BinaxNOW — a similarly quick test that hunts for bits of coronavirus protein rather than viral RNA — according to a senior administration official. Federal officials recently purchased the BinaxNOW to distribute by the millions to governors and vulnerable communities around the country. Rapid tests have been hailed by some experts as a welcome solution to the lengthy delays that have plagued expensive laboratory tests, although the products come with problems of their own. People without Covid-19 symptoms have been among those taking the test on White House grounds, where individuals who received negative results were granted swift access to the president and his advisers. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the F.D.A., described these procedures as a misguided attempt at a “zero-fail testing protocol” in an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday, saying that officials “weren’t taking any precautions beyond testing people who are going to be in contact with the president.” However, according to the products’ packaging, both Abbott rapid tests are intended for people with Covid-19 symptoms, early on in their illness. When Abbott submitted the tests for emergency authorization from the F.D.A., the company provided data only for people with symptoms. When used appropriately, the company has said, both tests perform about 95 percent as well as P.C.R. But how well the products do in asymptomatic individuals remains murky. In a statement, Darcy Ross, Abbott’s senior director of external communications, said the instructions that came with both products gave physicians the power to administer tests at their discretion, regardless of whether the recipients had symptoms. “As with all tests that have received an E.U.A., a health care provider will determine if a person needs a Covid-19 test,” she said. Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious disease physician based in South Carolina, said she would not feel comfortable administering such tests to healthy patients: “We don’t have data to show how this test is going to perform in that population.” Abbott was not required to submit data evaluating either test’s performance in asymptomatic populations when applying for emergency approval from the F.D.A. But Ms. Ross confirmed that such studies are underway, and the company has told experts that it thinks asymptomatic testing is likely to pan out. On Saturday evening, Andrea Wainer, Abbott’s executive vice president of rapid and molecular diagnostics, emailed a document entitled “Perspectives on Testing” to several public health experts, including Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, containing preliminary results outlining the ID NOW’s performance in people without symptoms. Among an unspecified number of individuals, the test picked up about 88 percent of the infections found by laboratory P.C.R. tests, the company statement said. Numbers were not reported for the BinaxNOW. “By studying the test in the asymptomatic people, Abbott knows it works in that population,” the document said. “It can’t say that for itself, because the test isn’t approved for that, but that data has been shared with others and the F.D.A. too.” In response to queries about the document, Ms. Ross said the data had been collected from “a few dozen individuals.” Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Southern California, expressed concern about the private release of the data. Without more transparency about how and when the results were achieved, and in whom, she said, “I have to take their numbers with a grain of salt.” Dr. Butler-Wu also noted that tests like the ID NOW have produced lackluster results in the hands of other researchers, missing 25 percent or more infections in people with symptoms.
