In the Senate race, Mark Kelly, a Democrat, leads the incumbent, Martha McSally. By Jonathan Martin WASHINGTON — Joseph R. Biden Jr. has established a steady lead over President Trump in Arizona, a traditionally Republican but fast-changing state that is tilting increasingly Democratic, according to a new New York Times-Siena College poll. Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump 49 percent to 41 percent in Arizona, with just 6 percent of likely voters saying they were undecided, according to the survey, which was taken before and after the president announced that he had tested positive for the virus that causes Covid-19 but after his caustic debate performance last week. The poll has a margin of error of 4.2 percentage points. The results are essentially unchanged from a Times-Siena poll of the state last month, which found Mr. Biden leading 49 percent to 40 percent. The poll illustrates the depth of Mr. Trump’s difficulties in Arizona — an incumbent Republican president trailing by a significant margin a month before an election in which most voters have made up their minds. With Arizona beginning early voting and sending out mail ballots this week, Mr. Trump is running out of time to improve his standing in a state that last supported a Democrat for president in 1996. Mr. Biden is being propelled by women, younger voters and Hispanic people, a coalition of the ascendant constituencies reshaping the politics of a state that Mr. Trump carried by about three and a half points in 2016. Mr. Biden is winning women by 18 points and trailing Mr. Trump by only two points among men. Among likely Hispanic voters, who are expected to make up about 20 percent of Arizona’s electorate, Mr. Biden is overwhelming the president, capturing 65 percent to Mr. Trump’s 27 percent. In a sign of a brewing suburban backlash against the president, Mr. Biden’s lead in Maricopa County, the Phoenix-anchored population hub of the state, matches his statewide advantage. He’s leading by nine points in the county, which accounts for over 60 percent of the state’s population. It’s highly difficult to win Arizona without winning Maricopa, which Mr. Trump captured by three points in 2016. The president’s standing with female voters and independents in the state has plunged since his victory four years ago, and, significantly, there appears to be far less interest in third-party candidates this year. In 2016, over 7 percent of voters cast a ballot for somebody besides Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton. This time, only 3 percent of likely voters said they planned to support the Libertarian Party nominee and just 1 percent said “somebody else” in the survey.  Those third-party votes were pivotal to Mr. Trump, who only garnered 48 percent of the vote in Arizona. The G.O.P.’s challenge in Arizona this year runs beyond the presidential race. The retired astronaut Mark Kelly, a Democrat, is leading Senator Martha McSally, a Republican, 50 percent to 39 percent in the Times-Siena poll, a slightly larger advantage than in last month’s survey. Mr. Kelly was winning 50 percent to 42 percent in September.
