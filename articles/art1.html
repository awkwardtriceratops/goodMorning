By Benjamin Hoffman Kim Ng has long been viewed as the person who would break baseball’s glass ceiling. Ng, 51, started at the bottom in baseball management more than 30 years ago and worked her way up, serving most recently as Major League Baseball’s senior vice president of baseball operations and previously as assistant general manager for both the Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers. On Friday, she became the first woman to be named the general manager of a major-league baseball team when she was hired by the Miami Marlins. “I entered Major League Baseball as an intern and, after decades of determination, it is the honor of my career to lead the Miami Marlins as their next general manager,” Ng said in a statement that accompanied the team’s announcement. In addition to being the first woman to lead the off-field management of a baseball team, the statement from the Marlins said Ng will be the first Asian-American general manager and that she is believed to be the first woman to hold the title of general manager for any of the major men's professional sports leagues in North America. Ng said her goal would be to bring championship baseball back to South Florida. “This challenge is one I don’t take lightly,” she said. “When I got into this business, it seemed unlikely a woman would lead a major league team, but I am dogged in the pursuit of my goals.” After graduating from the University of Chicago in 1990, Ng began her baseball career as an intern for the Chicago White Sox. She was hired as a full-time employee in 1991 and by 1995 had worked her way up to being the team’s assistant director of baseball operations. She left the White Sox to work for the American League in 1997 and in 1998 was recruited by General Manager Brian Cashman to join the Yankees where, at 29, she became the youngest assistant general manager in the majors. She joined the Dodgers in the same role in 2001, and was interviewed to be that team’s general manager in 2005, with the job going to Ned Colletti, who retained Ng as his top assistant. In 2011, she left the team for her role with the league, where she led international baseball operations, setting policy for signing players from other countries. Ng was hired by Derek Jeter, the chief executive of the Marlins, and was with the Yankees during part of Jeter’s time there as a star shortstop. Jeter had previously picked another woman for one of the top positions in the sport when he promoted Caroline O’Connor to chief operating officer of the Marlins. “Her leadership of our baseball operations team will play a major role on our path toward sustained success,” Jeter said in a statement. “Additionally, her extensive work in expanding youth baseball and softball initiatives will enhance our efforts to grow the game among our local youth as we continue to make a positive impact on the South Florida community.” Ng takes over from Michael Hill, who helped build a team that made a surprise appearance in this year’s playoffs before being swept by the Atlanta Braves in a division series. Hill was not retained for the 2021 season. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
