Now, that means subjecting an agent’s health to the whims of a contagious president. By Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Michael S. Schmidt WASHINGTON — For more than a century, Secret Service agents have lived by a straightforward ethos: They will take the president where he wants to go, even if it means putting their bodies in front of a bullet. But that guiding principle has been tested in recent days by President Trump’s desire to get back to work, play or campaigning, despite an active coronavirus infection that could pose a serious threat to those around him. The problem came into focus on Sunday, when a masked Mr. Trump climbed into a hermetically sealed, armored Chevy Suburban with at least two Secret Service agents — covered head to toe in the same personal protective equipment used by doctors — so the president could wave to a group of supporters outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. Medical experts said the move recklessly put agents at risk. Secret Service personnel have privately questioned whether additional precautions will be put in place to protect the detail from the man they have pledged to protect. “It’s on everybody’s mind,” said W. Ralph Basham, a former director of the Secret Service and the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the George W. Bush administration. “The ones no longer there are happy they’re not there. These are tough decisions to have to make.” On Monday evening, Mr. Trump again endangered the agents around him when he traveled by helicopter back to the White House after being discharged from the hospital. Central to the job of Secret Service agents is a willingness to say yes to the president no matter what he asks. Now, that means subjecting an agent’s health to Mr. Trump’s whims. Critics say the president is not repaying his protectors’ dedication with anything like care or consideration. While agents have volunteered to sacrifice themselves for those they protect, they do so knowing that there is a low chance they will need to step in between a gunman and the president. “If they’re on the protection detail, they’ll take a bullet for their protectee,” said Janet Napolitano, President Barack Obama’s first homeland security secretary. “There’s a difference between that and being unnecessarily exposed to risk,” she added, one that extends to their families. The drive-by visit to Mr. Trump’s supporters drove home that point, Ms. Napolitano said. “There was nothing about his little motorcade yesterday that was required or wise or necessary,” she said on Monday. “It was a superfluous act.” Secret Service agents have always needed to make last-minute adjustments based on the political whims of presidents, said Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian. And the relationship between presidents and their protection details has usually allowed for a limited amount of debate. But in the end, presidents have an appetite for making public appearances before their supporters, allies and in some cases, adversaries. And the president has final say. “These are people that have volunteered to give their lives for theirs, and almost every president I can recall uses that privilege carefully and with great respect,” Mr. Beschloss said. Mr. Trump responded to the criticism on Monday by blaming the news media.
