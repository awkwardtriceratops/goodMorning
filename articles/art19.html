Today, we explore how, in the face of huge complications and potentially crushing risks, a regional production attempted to bring theater back to life. On today’s episode: Michael Paulson, a theater reporter for The Times. Background reading: Masks, partitions and a contactless crucifixion — the Berkshire Theater Group’s production of Godspell, labeled one of the “huggiest musicals ever created,” is also a kind of public health experiment.
