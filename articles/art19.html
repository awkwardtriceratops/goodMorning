Also: A call for your adapted Thanksgiving traditions. By Jill Cowan Good morning. In California, we’ve spent the past several days learning new details about the ways in which some of our leaders have flouted the very same guidelines they’ve promoted to help keep everyone safe. That French Laundry dinner Gov. Gavin Newsom apologized for attending? Photos obtained by Fox 11 show it was not as outdoors as you might have thought. As CalMatters reported, two high-powered doctors’ association executives were also among the guests. Oh, and reporters are still trying to figure out which of your elected representatives decided to go to Hawaii for a lavish policy summit, just days after California announced advisories against traveling out of state, because many of them won’t own up to being there. Nevertheless, we are now exactly one week away from Thanksgiving — a holiday that experts have warned is almost custom tailored to facilitate the spread of the coronavirus. Both the state and local governments have been announcing new restrictions or reinstating previous ones aimed at getting the surge under control. Here’s what you need to know about restrictions now: More than 94 percent of the state’s population lives in the 41 counties currently under the state’s purple tier of restrictions. What does that mean? It means that many businesses that may have been operating indoors, such as restaurants, movie theaters and museums, must either move everything outdoors or close down. Hair salons and barber shops can be open indoors with modifications. Shopping malls, stores and swap meets can be open at 25 percent capacity. Indoor gatherings of any kind are banned and outdoor gatherings can only include people from up to three households. [See a grid showing what’s open and what’s closed under each tier on the California Department of Public Health’s website.| Look up where your county falls here.] All that said, individual counties may impose more stringent restrictions than the state mandates. For instance, officials in Los Angeles County — which has struggled for months with stubbornly high case loads — have said that the virus is spreading to dangerous and unsustainable levels. So, effective Friday, the county is requiring that restaurants operate at half capacity, even outdoors. Also, personal care businesses can’t accept walk-ins, and they must provide only services that don’t require customers to take their masks off. As far as outdoor gatherings, which the state guidelines cap at simply three households, Los Angeles County is capping at 15 people. And if things continue to get worse, officials say they will reimpose a stay-at-home order similar to the one the county implemented in March, which would require people to stay home except to go to essential businesses. (The threshold would be a five-day average of more than 4,000 new cases per day, or if there are more than 1,750 hospitalizations per day.) San Francisco officials have also paused reopening plans without a state mandate. [Track coronavirus case numbers and hospitalizations by California county.] So is there a curfew? Although earlier this week, Mr. Newsom said he and other state officials were looking at research into whether some kind of statewide curfew could be effective, there is no such curfew right now. In Los Angeles, however, the county is requiring all restaurants, bar, wineries and nonessential stores to close from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Last week, New York officials announced a similar step, requiring bars and restaurants to close at 10 p.m. When do we have to wear masks? The state updated its mask mandate recently to make it slightly more expansive. But for the most part, if you’ve been following it already you won’t have to do anything different. There are a few exceptions, but, basically, if you’re inside somewhere that’s not your home, and you’re not eating or drinking (which probably won’t be the case, given that indoor dining should be closed in most of the state), you should be wearing a mask. If you’re outside, but you’re somewhere you may come within six feet of people, you should be wearing a mask. And if you’re in a car with someone who doesn’t live in your household, you should be wearing a mask. (This article is part of the California Today newsletter.
