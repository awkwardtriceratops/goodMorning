But his best-known composition became an enduring standard, and he became a mainstay of the outlaw country movement. By Bill Friskics-Warren Jerry Jeff Walker, the singer-songwriter who wrote the much-recorded standard “Mr. Bojangles” and later became a mainstay of the Texas outlaw movement that catapulted Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings to fame, died on Friday at a hospital in Austin, Texas. He was 78. His former publicist John T. Davis said the cause was cancer. Mr. Walker learned he had throat cancer in 2017.
