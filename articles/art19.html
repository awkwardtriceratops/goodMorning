By Michael Wilson and Edgar Sandoval The mayor of Rochester, N.Y., a city reeling since the disclosure that a Black man died after officers placed him in a hood, lashed out at the Police Department on Monday, saying that it “views everything through the eyes of the badge,” and calling for a federal civil rights investigation into the man’s death and other arrests going back three years. The mayor, Lovely Warren, abruptly fired the police chief, La’Ron Singletary, two weeks before he was to step down in the wake of the man’s death. The man, Daniel Prude, died in March, days after being handcuffed and restrained by officers. The mayor said a preliminary investigation into Mr. Prude’s death “has shown what so many have suspected, that we have a pervasive problem in the Rochester Police Department.” Ms. Warren also suspended the city’s spokesman and attorney for 30 days. She said blame for the handling of Mr. Prude’s death — which has led to accusations of a cover-up — was spread throughout the city’s halls of power. “Mr. Prude’s death was not taken as seriously as it should have been by those who reviewed the case throughout city government at every level,” Ms. Warren said.    She directed the city’s Office of Public Integrity to investigate whether anyone — herself included — “violated city or departmental policies or ethical standards,” according to a statement. The harsh assessment of the city by its sitting mayor is the latest development in a case that was overlooked for months after the police characterized Mr. Prude’s death as resulting from a drug overdose. It gained national attention only in recent weeks after Mr. Prude’s family released body camera footage from the officers, which had been obtained through an open records request. Those videos led to a voluminous report issued by Ms. Warren on Monday, including hundreds of pages of police documents and internal correspondence between city lawyers and the police since Mr. Prude’s detainment on March 23. The report said that in the weeks that followed, police investigators cleared the officers and said Mr. Prude’s death was caused by a drug overdose, even though an autopsy gave asphyxia as a cause. That account — a fatal drug overdose — would remain attached to the case for months in the police communications with city leaders, the report states. Chief Singletary did not mention Mr. Prude’s case during more than 50 meetings he had with Ms. Warren between March 23 and Aug. 4, according to the report. A summary of the report by a deputy mayor, James P. Smith, questioned the officers’ very character. “None of the officers offered Mr. Prude a blanket or covering, and there is no evidence that this thought occurred to any of them or anyone at RPD who subsequently reviewed videos of the incident,” Mr. Smith wrote. “The simple concepts of human decency and dignity appeared to be woefully lacking or nonexistent.” He asked: “Is this exceptional behavior or ‘business as usual’ in the Police Department?” Mark Simmons, a member of Mr. Singletary’s inner circle who was demoted last week, was tapped to serve as interim police chief for the next 30 days, effective immediately, said Jessica Alaimo, a City Hall spokeswoman. Mr. Simmons most recently served as deputy chief of the department’s administration bureau overseeing training, emergency planning and other duties. The mayor earlier this month suspended seven officers involved in the encounter. Mr. Prude’s family said on Monday that the mayor took too long to take action in response to his death.
