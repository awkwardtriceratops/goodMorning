By Farnaz Fassihi Iran released a British-Australian scholar, Kylie Moore-Gilbert, detained since 2018 on spying charges, in a prisoner swap conducted Wednesday for three Iranian men who had been held abroad, Iranian official news media reported. Iran did not reveal the identities of the three citizens it said had been swapped for Ms. Moore-Gilbert nor the identity of the country or countries where they had been held. The semiofficial Fars News Agency described the three as “businessmen.” But social media channels affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in Iran identified the three as Saeed Moradi, Mohammad Khazaei and Masoud Sedaghat Zadeh, all detained in Thailand since 2012 on charges of having planned to bomb the capital, Bangkok, and assassinate Israeli diplomats there. Mr. Moradi lost both legs in a bomb explosion in Thailand and footage from the swap in Iran on state television Wednesday showed one of the men on a wheelchair. Their faces were covered with a mask and they were wearing hats, making it difficult to identify them. The television broadcast what it described as the exchange for Ms. Moore-Gilbert, who was shown wearing a gray head scarf and a mask, waiting in a room along with another woman. The three Iranian men, draped in Iran’s flag, were seen passing through the door and greeted with flowers and leis to chants of praise for the Prophet Muhammad.
