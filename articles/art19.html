He has also described the book as a “mea culpa” for his own late notice of this trend. On this week’s podcast, he talks about the book and what he sees as some hope for the future. “The fact that the Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party is now somewhat ascendant,” Andersen says, “along with the Bernie Sanders wing, along with the Yang candidacy, I think we are talking about things — the future of automation, fairness in the society, all those things — that really weren’t on the table for several decades because Democrats didn’t put them on the table because they didn’t have a distinct point of view about how our political economy should be and used to be and was screwed up by the right.” Lesley M.M. Blume visits the podcast to discuss her new book, “Fallout,” which documents how John Hersey brought news to Americans of the human suffering beneath the images of the mushroom cloud over Hiroshima.
