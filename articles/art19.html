Neither injury was life threatening. By Ashley Southall A man in Queens shot two police officers responding to a domestic violence call on Tuesday, prompting them to return fire and kill him, the police said. The man, whose name officials did not release, opened fire on the officers at around 12:45 p.m. at his home on 179th Street in Jamaica near Kennedy International Airport, the police said. He died at the scene. The officers were both wounded, one hit in an arm and the other one in a leg, but were expected to survive, the police said. They were taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center for treatment, according to the Fire Department. Mayor Bill de Blasio was briefed on the shooting and headed to the hospital, a spokesman said on Twitter. Cellphone video taken by bystanders at the scene showed police swarming the street and putting up yellow crime-scene tape near a row of two-story homes as a small crowd stood across the street. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
