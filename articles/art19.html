Fraud Inquiry<br></h1><p id="artcont">The president’s son had said he would not give a sworn deposition to the New York attorney general until after the election, but a state judge said he must cooperate sooner. By William K. Rashbaum and Danny Hakim A New York state judge on Wednesday ordered President Trump’s son Eric to answer questions under oath before the election in a fraud investigation into his family’s real estate business. Last week, Eric Trump’s lawyers said he was willing to be interviewed — but would only do so after the presidential election because he did not want his deposition to be used “for political purposes.” But on Wednesday, a judge in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Arthur F. Engoron, ruled that Mr. Trump had to sit for a deposition no later than Oct. 7, rejecting his arguments that a delay was necessary. “This court finds that application unpersuasive,” Justice Engoron said in his ruling Wednesday afternoon, which he read from the bench after a two-hour hearing earlier in the day. “Mr. Trump cites no authority in support of his request, and in any event, neither petitioner, nor this court, is bound by timelines of the national election.” The judge also ordered the company and several related entities and lawyers to turn over a variety of records connected to four of the properties under scrutiny. The attorney general, Letitia James, a Democrat, has been conducting a civil investigation into whether President Trump and the Trump Organization committed fraud by overstating assets to get loans and tax benefits. Ms. James’s office had asked the judge to compel Eric Trump, the executive vice president of his father’s business, to answer questions under oath, and to turn over a broad range of documents that the office sought under subpoena, court papers show. In July, Mr. Trump abruptly canceled an interview with the attorney general’s office, days before it was scheduled, and in August, the Trump Organization told the office that the company and its lawyers would not comply with seven subpoenas related to the investigation. Mr. Trump’s lawyers said in court papers last week that he was willing to be interviewed after the November election, citing his “extreme travel schedule” and his determination “to avoid the use of his deposition attendance for political purposes.” Marc L. Mukasey, one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, defended his client in a text message after the hearing. “Eric Trump has nothing to hide and did nothing wrong,” he wrote. “Neither did anybody else. This is simply a matter of scheduling.”
