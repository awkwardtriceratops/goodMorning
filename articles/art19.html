But President Trump’s health crisis is filtered through the partisan lenses that divide Americans on seemingly every issue. By Jennifer Medina and Trip Gabriel PHOENIX — Soon after he woke up on Friday morning, Cruz Zepeda, a 54-year-old Trump supporter, received a text from a lifelong friend eager to share a sentiment he found on Twitter: “Looks like RBG successfully argued her first hearing with the Lord.” Still in a bit of shock, Mr. Zepeda felt his anger rise. The friends once shared similar political beliefs, but disagreed more often than not over the past 15 years. “This is not funny,” he shot back. “This is real time, real life and really happening.” The pandemic could have been a great unifier — a widespread and life-altering tragedy that inspired a notion of shared national purpose, as at other moments of crisis in the country’s past. And perhaps in another moment, in another place, a president falling ill would have seen citizens keeping vigil regardless of political affiliation. But the coronavirus, which has sickened more than seven million Americans, including the president, the first lady and a growing number of people in his inner circle, has deepened divisions rather than united the country. Now, a month before Election Day and with the president in the hospital, interviews with voters in some of the most contested battleground states make clear that the divisions that the president himself has stoked in the country are being reflected back at him, with his supporters defiantly insisting he will hold rallies again before Nov. 3 and Democrats, if not wishing him a turn for the worse, certainly not shedding any tears. A day before the president disclosed his illness, Mr. Zepeda, a crane operator who is currently out of work, stopped by a South Phoenix campaign office in a strip mall, wearing a blue “Keep America Great” mask. He was there to pick up another Trump-Pence lawn sign, because, he said, several had already been stolen from his yard. In his eyes, Mr. Trump’s revelation on Twitter that he had the virus was a powerful admission to be admired.
