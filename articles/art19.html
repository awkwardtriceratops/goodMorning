McCarthy asked those leading the inquiry to examine whether commanders at the Texas base allowed a climate of harassment to spread. By Helene Cooper WASHINGTON — The Army is expanding its investigation into the killing of a female soldier to include the entire chain of command at Fort Hood, after both male and female soldiers described a culture of sexual harassment and bullying they said had been ignored by the leadership of the large installation in Texas, Defense Department officials said on Tuesday. Army leaders on Tuesday appointed Gen. John M. Murray, a four-star officer in charge of the Army Futures Command, to lead an in-depth investigation into all “chain-of-command actions” related to the death of Specialist Vanessa Guillen, who disappeared from Fort Hood in April and whose remains were found in June.
