Here Are 5 Ways to Ward Off Election Anxiety<br></h1><p id="artcont">And one reason to embrace it. By Spencer Bokat-Lindell Mr. Bokat-Lindell is a staff editor.

Election Day is here, and if you’re like most Americans, you are probably anxious about it. As one California voter put it to The Times: “Everyone is starting to panic.” The feeling is fairly bipartisan: According to a survey from the American Psychological Association, 76 percent of Democrats and 67 percent of Republicans say the presidential election is a significant source of stress in their lives. How can you control it? Should you even try to? Here’s what mental health professionals and journalists are saying. Tune into a live broadcast of “The Daily” on Election Day: Dozens of Times reporters will break down what’s happening live at the polls, inside campaigns and in key battleground states. 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern. Because of the surge of early voting and mail-in ballots this year, there is a significant chance the election will not be called tonight. In fact, only nine states expect to have at least 98 percent of unofficial results reported by noon on Nov. 4. If you’re looking for bellwethers, Florida, Georgia and North Carolina will be the states to watch. As my colleague David Leonhardt explains, all three are likely to count votes quickly, and if Mr. Biden manages to win any of them, the presidency will probably be his. But if Mr. Trump seems to be winning all of those states, the race could end up turning on Arizona and Pennsylvania, whose results could take several days to report. That’s not in itself cause for alarm, but it is a reason to lower your expectations for tonight. If the results do end up delayed, checking their status every minute will not make them arrive any faster. Instead, the A.P.A. recommends, take breaks from the news to engage in activities that bring you a sense of calm or fulfillment. “When I feel anxious, I often turn to this episode of ‘On Being’ with the poet Ross Gay on how he finds delight in everyday life, even as he struggles to process our overwhelming reality and push for social justice,” Jenna Wortham, a writer for The New York Times Magazine, told me. “Take frequent social media breaks! Dance to the new Busta Rhymes or Ariana Grande album in the kitchen with yourself, your partner or children.”
