POP & ROCK Disco’s foothold in pop has grown considerably this year — even though the world’s dance floors have never been so quiet. While Dua Lipa strapped on her roller skates and tipped her cap to Madonna’s “Confessions on the Dance Floor,” Jessie Ware went full-on Studio 54 with “What’s Your Pleasure?,” her album from June. Other recent dabblers in the genre include Selena Gomez and Doja Cat. And then there’s Kylie Minogue. Both Lipa and Ware have been vocal in their admiration of the Australian singer, who, despite occasional dalliances with other styles (country on 2018’s “Golden” or techno on 2003’s “Body Language”), has been a reliable producer of disco-pop for decades. In fact, “Disco” is an apt title for her 15th studio album, due out on Friday. The record is packed with glitter bombs; there’s nary a ballad to be found. To celebrate the release, Minogue is presenting “Kylie: Infinite Disco,” a ticketed digital concert that will stream several times, including at 8 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday. It’s no D.I.Y. affair, unlike many virtual performances in this era. Fans can expect a characteristically glitzy performance from Minogue, complete with lasers and a full backing choir. Tickets are $20 and available at dice.fm.
OLIVIA HORN ART & MUSEUMS Throughout this year, galleries have been trying to come up with safe ways to display art to the public. For “Paper Mirror” — the latest installment of 601 Artspace’s “Storefront Exhibition” series, which closes on Monday — the married artists Jennifer and Kevin McCoy recreated, with intricate line drawings, the reflection of buildings across from the gallery’s facade window, establishing a type of wider narrative on whether storefronts serve as the clearest indicator of urban health (or lack thereof). On Saturday, from 2 to 4 p.m., the McCoys will discuss the project in a socially distanced chat in front of the installation. The city has been historically at odds with street art, but it is occasionally embraced, in the right context. For the latest Houston Bowery Wall, located on Houston Street between Elizabeth and Bowery Streets, the muralist Raúl Ayala pairs Black figures with mythical creatures. Further north, in front of the Vessel at the Hudson Yards for the public art initiative HYxOffTheWall, Elle and Key Detail have created two large-scale murals that celebrate the city’s resilience. Nearby at Lehmann Maupin, Billie Zangewa portrays, in scenes composed of vividly colored silk, what that resilience was borne out of: our isolation after spending months at home. On view through Saturday, the exhibition is indoors, but the gallery is enforcing mask wearing and social distancing.
