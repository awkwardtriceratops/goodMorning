By Spencer Bokat-Lindell Mr. Bokat-Lindell is a staff editor. This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It is perhaps for the best that the Democratic Party has long prided itself on being a “big tent,” since it is quickly reaching circus-size proportions. On Monday night, John Kasich, a Republican who enacted some of the country’s most restrictive abortion laws, gutted collective bargaining rights and opposed same-sex marriage while serving as governor of Ohio, gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention in support of Joe Biden. Just hours before, Mr. Kasich had said in an interview with BuzzFeed News that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York didn’t represent the Democratic Party. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who will speak for one minute tonight at the convention, returned the favor on Twitter: It’s great that Kasich has woken up &realized the importance of supporting a Biden-Harris ticket. I hope he gets through to GOP voters.

Yet also, something tells me a Republican who fights against women’s rights doesn’t get to say who is or isn’t representative of the Dem party. https://t.co/38h6JGpbMj In truth, no one has more influence over how the Democratic Party defines itself now than Donald Trump. “From the progressive left to the moderate wing, Mr. Trump has served for months as the glue keeping the party from fracturing,” my colleagues Astead Herndon and Sydney Ember wrote of last night’s virtual festivities. “Everyone at the first night of the Democrats’ virtual gathering could at least agree that Mr. Biden should be the next president. They can worry about the rest later.” But later will come soon enough, and Mr. Trump will not always be there to provide the Democratic Party with a common purpose. If the Democrats actually manage to take power in November, what will they do with it? Here’s what people are saying. In Vox, Matthew Yglesias writes that the Democratic Party is divided, broadly speaking, into two camps: On one side lies the revolutionary wing, which views President Trump as a product of pre-existing political dysfunction that, if left unattended, will produce new and potentially more competent right-wing demagogues after he leaves office. On the other side, Mr. Yglesias says, lies the restorationist wing, which believes that Trump merely “took the sheen off a United States that really was a shining city on a hill.” Given both Mr. Biden’s ascent to the nomination and the slate of people the party chose to speak at the convention, it seems clear which wing predominates. “Joe Biden, one of the most experienced Democrats and the oldest nominee in history, has spoken of himself as a ‘bridge’ to the next generation of Democratic leaders,” Charlotte Alter writes for Time. “But after more than three years of nearly unprecedented grass roots activism in the Democratic Party, with a new crop of young rising stars shining across the country, few of those have been given prominent roles in this week’s convention. It’s like a band that wrote a whole new album but, when it came time to perform at Madison Square Garden, stuck to the safe, familiar hits instead.” Of course, the convention speaking schedule is not necessarily predictive of how a Biden administration might govern. But taken together, the party’s appeals to restraint and restoration are being interpreted by some not just as a canny electoral strategy but as an earnest expression of political principle. “There’s a whole wing of the Democratic Party establishment that doesn’t simply want an electoral victory,” Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, told The Times last month. “They want to defeat Trump and progressives in one fell swoop.” That impression is shared by the Times columnist Bret Stephens, who argues that his fellow conservatives should vote for Mr. Biden if only to pull both the Republican and Democratic parties back toward the center. “If nothing else, conservatives should feel grateful to Biden for thrashing Sanders in the primary,” he writes. “The success of liberal centrism now rests on the success of Biden’s candidacy.” [Related: “The Never Trumpers Have Already Won”] In all likelihood, Mr. Biden’s conciliatory approach toward moderates and conservatives would carry over from the White House into Congress. Unlike his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, and even Barack Obama, Mr. Biden continues to oppose eliminating the filibuster. How, then, does he hope to get legislation past Republicans in the Senate? What Biden would do, one of his advisers explained to Dylan Matthews at Vox, is simply work with Republicans. That answer is why Mr. Matthews imagines two visions for a Biden presidency: One involves executing the relatively progressive agenda he’s promising. The other, Mr. Matthews says, “involves McConnell forcing Biden into brutal, humiliating budget deals that usher in austerity and strangle the recovery in the crib.” In an interview with Mr. Sanders, my colleague Elizabeth Bruenig asked the senator why progressives like her shouldn’t give in to despair: Yes, support for “Medicare for all” has crawled upward during the pandemic, but both the Democratic Party and Mr. Biden still oppose the policy, and his announcement that he would be running with Ms. Harris caused a stock market rally. “If gains made in the realm of ideas don’t translate into democratic power, what difference do they make?” Ms. Bruenig asked. Mr. Sanders, however, was hopeful. Despite the left’s failure to capture the nomination for the second time in four years, it plainly exerts more influence over the party than it did in 2016. That much was evident in Mr. Biden’s decision in March to endorse both a pared-down version of Mr. Sanders’s proposal to make four-year public colleges tuition-free and Senator Elizabeth Warren’s plan to reform bankruptcy laws. After Mr. Sanders dropped out, Mr. Biden continued to tack left, adopting significantly more ambitious proposals to expand caregiving programs, close the racial wealth gap and stop climate change. As Waleed Shahid, the communications director for Justice Democrats, told Vox, Mr. Biden’s is “the most progressive platform of any Democratic nominee in the modern history of the party.” [Read More: “How the coronavirus got Joe Biden to think much bigger”] Mr. Biden’s campaign narrative has also changed to reflect that reality. For much of the primary, his message could be boiled down to “restoring the soul of America,” a kind of liberal answer to Mr. Trump’s politics of redemptive, exclusionary nostalgia. By July, however, the campaign had made a noticeable shift, embracing the more forward-looking mission to “Build Back Better” and casting Mr. Biden as a successor to Franklin D. Roosevelt. “He seems to be recognizing that, in the midst of Covid-19, simply going back to normal, which was his original orientation, is insufficient,” Mr. Mitchell said. In Congress, too, the Democratic Party has shown signs of leftward movement. In recent weeks, all four members of the “Squad” of progressive women of color elected to the House in 2018, including Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, trounced their primary opponents, while several of their more conservative colleagues were toppled by progressive challengers, including Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri.

Mr. Jones said that when Mr. Sanders dropped out of the presidential race, many of his young supporters migrated to help Mr. Jones, who like Mr. Sanders campaigned on Medicare for all and a Green New Deal. “It really, I think, was a transference of that energy,” he said. Mr. Jones’s district, unlike Mr. Bowman’s or Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s, is one of the wealthiest in the country, and only 10 percent Black. If Mr. Jones wins the general election, as he is expected to, he will represent the people of Chappaqua, including Hillary and Bill Clinton. “I think the energy in this party is on the left,” Mr. Jones told The Intercept. “And I hope that people who are in power in this party realize that and bring us into the fold.” Do you have a point of view we missed?

But I’m More Optimistic Than Ever.” [The New York Times] “Just How Far Will Joe Biden Go?” [The New York Times] “Michelle Obama Showed Us Why These Democrats Are Our Last Best Hope” [The New York Times] Here’s what readers had to say about the last debate: Was Kamala Harris the right pick? Mordy: “Manisha Sinha can furthermore reasonably anticipate the prospect of the 2024 general presidential election pitting two Indian-American women against each other — a far cry from this year’s contest between two older white men.” Sara: “I literally wept with joy when I heard the news that Kamala Harris was selected. I can’t speak for all (white) women, but it’s SO significant to me. Women in this country, especially Black and immigrant women, but even white women too, have long endured taking a back seat to less qualified men. I pray that I and my daughters will have a chance to see her serve in this office for which she is so well qualified.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
