Around the corner, two black Suburbans with federal license plates were parked by the building’s entrance — the only visible clue to the nearby presence of the California senator and vice president-elect, Kamala Harris. In the days since he prevailed in the election, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has made several public remarks and released summaries of his calls with foreign leaders as reporters track his every public movement. But Ms. Harris has barely appeared on the public radar since her acceptance speech last Saturday in Wilmington, Del., where she declared “a new day for America.” TRANSCRIPT “Across the country anxiety is growing ...” “One the most contentious elections in history ...” “... and pandemic that has transformed the way the nation votes...” “Here’s Pennsylvania, a must win for Trump, his lead. has been ...” “Votes are being counted in the states that will decide this election ...” “Let’s take a look at Arizona now ...” “Is trying to undermine this election ...” “We are at a tipping point ... Vice President Joe Biden will win Pennsylvania ...” “... shows no signs of conceding ...” [overlapping sound] “I would say the mood and energy of this election would be very chaotic.” “Unfortunately, no one’s listening and everyone is talking.” “I think the biggest part is just the relief. All the political ads are over. Everybody I know is just done with that.” “Around here, it’s suburbia, so you have that split vote, people feeling disenfranchised one way or the other.” “There’s a lot of inequality in this country, huge, you know. We judge each other by how we look. We hide behind our social media.” “Something that we’ve moved away from is having open discussion of ideas. And I think that Pinellas is such a swing area, it’s because we do have those type of discussions, hash some things out, you know.” “And they were teaching people to hate our country ...” “Will you shut up?” “... 47 years you’ve done nothing, they understand ...” “You’re the worst president America has ever had.” “I’m a patriot. So no matter who is in office, I’ll respect that. But as it’s going right now, oh my God, it’s like a bunch of chickens fighting each other.” “The last four years have left me wanting more.” “It was a lot of anxiety leading up to this point.” “I want people to have more trust in government, have more trust in the political leaders and the people we elect.” “Politics are pretty divided and things seem really dark. But, you know, as a person of color, things have always kind of been dark.” “I don’t think we focus enough on environment. We certainly don’t focus enough on, you know, the downtrodden. We just don’t do enough to help people.” “Donald Trump has a death grip over the grass roots of the Republican Party ...” ”... Democrat Party wants to turn us into a socialist nation ...” “Donald Trump is running a hustle the most gullible voters in history.” “The silent majority.” “... against the truth ...” “There’s a feeling as if middle America is just told to shut up and sit there and vote left.” “I did vote for Trump and I would again. There’s nothing that he doesn’t represent in who I am.” “We were not necessarily going to vote for Joe Biden until, you know, maybe May or June. And by then Covid was really pretty awful.” “I voted for Donald Trump despite the issues that I have with him. Just mainly for economic policy and for stances on international affairs.” “I mean, it’s difficult because neither party is really representative of a hyper-progressive stance that I would enjoy.” “I do not want to live in a socialist country. Not at all. That was my main focus. Secondly, right now, I think the economy is great. It’s making a huge comeback. And I think Trump was the man to do it and to keep it going.” “This country ... it’s frightening how many states voted for Trump. I thought we would, he would, Biden would win in a landslide. And it’s shocking. I’m shocked.” “This has been a tough election for me, honestly. I’ve always voted Republican. I did not vote Republican this time. I voted Democrat because I do not like Donald Trump.” “There are downsides to both. And because of that, I personally, I didn’t do enough research to vote. Family-wise, I do have family that supports Trump. But I just ... I couldn’t.” “Well, the one that stood out that he was for the little guy. Biden, because he’s down to earth.” “One side of a deeply divided country is celebrating this week.” “Biden-Harris campaign has the most radical platform ...” “And Donald Trump has shown us time and time again, how he feels about our community.” “... completely sick of identity politics, it’s garbage ...” “... a racist ...” “When I was a younger woman, you know, we talked about the elections all the time. But we don’t anymore.” “I think Democrats are a little more open-minded, you know, fair to see the other side, thinking critically, and it just seems like the voters on the other side, just like, ‘This is how it is.’” “I would love to talk to my friends on the other side, but it gets too...heated.” “And that’s, that’s really bad. It stops the conversation that we need to be having, but we don’t do it. We don’t.” “A reshaped Republican Party, now grappling with what its future holds.” “... the president is now enveloping himself is this fantasy that the election is still ongoing.” “He is ignoring a pandemic, which actually is ongoing.” “... has been talking about unity, what they’re pushing for ...” “... divided country ... pay off all of this pain.” “Heck yeah, a united country matters. I mean, this is America. I hope my liberal friends are right. I still love them all the same.” “I do not think we will be unified at all.” “Honestly, it will probably get a little bit worse before it gets any better.” “I don’t feel any kind of way against anyone who chooses Trump. They have their reasons for doing what they do, like I have my reasons for voting for who I voted for.” “And I will respect the president, no matter who it is. And that’s unlike Trump. He got no respect from anybody that was against him. And I think that’s wrong.” “I don’t think we’ll ever get there. We’ve always been divided.” “America is America. But I look at the good side and there’s a lot of good people here. A lot.” “Yes, it matters that we are a united country. If we don’t stand for something, we’ll fall for anything.” She shared a stage again with Mr. Biden in Wilmington two days later, after a coronavirus briefing they had attended together. Ms. Harris stood silently several feet away while Mr. Biden spoke, without giving remarks of her own. It is not unprecedented for a vice president-elect to keep a low profile in an election’s aftermath. “You know, you’ve been fairly invisible since the election,” the ABC News host George Stephanopoulos told Mr. Biden in an interview more than a month after his own election as Barack Obama’s vice president. Mr. Biden replied by insisting he had “been in the room” for every one of Mr. Obama’s important transition meetings. Because of social-distancing restrictions related to the coronavirus, Ms. Harris has no such luxury, at least not in the physical sense. After spending election week in Delaware, she has returned to the two-bedroom Washington condominium she bought after she was elected to the Senate in 2016. From there, she is in regular touch with Mr. Biden, by text message or telephone, according to aides with the Biden-Harris transition team, and with other transition officials. Ms. Harris’s husband, Douglas Emhoff, also has a close relationship with the incoming first lady, Jill Biden; the two campaigned together in the race’s final weeks. One focus of her time is the quantum leap Ms. Harris is soon to make from the legislative to the executive branch. Whereas Mr. Biden will have virtually no learning curve upon returning to the White House after eight years as vice president, Ms. Harris has spent little, if any, substantive time at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. (A transition official could not immediately say when she had last visited there.) That process is made no easier by President Trump’s refusal to acknowledge the election results and authorize an official transition process in which Ms. Harris and her aides would have access to White House officials and documents. Ms. Harris has not been contacted by her departing counterpart, Vice President Mike Pence. Days after the 2016 election, Mr. Biden hosted Mr. Pence for nearly two hours at the official vice-presidential compound at the U.S. Naval Observatory. “I told Mike, the vice president-elect, that I’m available to him 24/7,” Mr. Biden told reporters. Biden-Harris transition officials declined to comment. For now, Ms. Harris remains a senator. It is unclear when she might relinquish her seat. Mr. Obama stepped down from his Senate seat days after his 2008 election, but Mr. Biden, ever the sentimentalist, hung on to his until shortly before he was sworn in as vice president the following January, telling friends he wanted to take one last oath of office for the seat he had held for decades. (Mr. Biden also said he wanted to retain his vote in case it might be needed in a lame-duck Senate session.) Like Mr. Biden, Ms. Harris also has her own staff to build — another task potentially made more challenging by her relative lack of Washington experience. While Mr. Biden, after nearly 50 years in the capital, has a network of hundreds of former Senate and White House aides, Ms. Harris has a smaller circle, though she is expected to hire several familiar faces from her Senate office and her 2020 campaign. On social media, Ms. Harris has stayed rigorously on message, posting on Twitter several times about the coronavirus and her determination to work with Mr. Biden to contain it. “In just a few months, we will swear in a new president who is committed to getting the pandemic under control: @JoeBiden,” she tweeted on Saturday morning. Later in the day, Ms. Harris, who will become the first occupant of the White House who is of Indian heritage, also tweeted greetings for the beginning of Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights. Ms. Harris has ventured out in the Washington area at least once since the election. On a rainy Veterans Day, wearing bluejeans and a black raincoat, she and Mr. Emhoff dropped by Georgetown’s Dog Tag Bakery, which was founded to help support veterans. She has otherwise been out of sight at her condo building, about a mile from the White House, and twice that distance from the Naval Observatory complex she will soon call home. “No great thing created suddenly,” reads an inscription on the side of the building, a quote from the Greek Stoic philosopher Epictetus. Mimicking a sad face, the server at the Bluestone Lane cafe on the building’s ground floor said he hoped she would visit again soon. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
