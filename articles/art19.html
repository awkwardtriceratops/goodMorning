Dear Diary: I was at the butcher waiting for the two sweet Italian sausages I had ordered. I turned to see a man behind me wearing a sweater that I also own. “I own that same sweater,” I said. “I love this sweater,” he said. “Barney’s on the Upper West Side?” “Madison Avenue store,” I said. “Ten years ago?” “Probably 12.” “I wish they’d had other colors,” I said. “I agree.” “My wife hates the sweater.” “Mine, too!” “I only wear it when she’s not around,” I said. “I feel guilty about that, like I’m cheating on her.” “Your secret’s safe with me.” “Thanks.” I paid for the sausages. “That was weird, no?” I said to the man in the sweater. “Yeah,” he said. “Pretty weird.” — Robert Schwartz Dear Diary: The fire hydrants along Fifth Avenue
speak German, French, Spanish, Mandarin,
and in a pinch, they spray wet English
words into little puddles.
The rain has the same
inclination. It falls from the sky.
Its wet words tell us hello and goodbye.
They’d like to mingle.
They prefer not to encounter umbrellas.
They enjoy reflecting in puddles
the blue sky, seven thousand people
walking by, not caring if the puddle
knows their name
or has any kind thing to say
as rain puddles do most of their talking
when they get stepped on.
They leap up. They crawl
from their shallow places
and speak their minds.
The splash says it all.
