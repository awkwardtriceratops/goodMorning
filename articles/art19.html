Readers, take out your crystal ball and write the script for what you think (not wish) will happen on Election Day and in its aftermath. Possible plot elements: Will the same candidate win the popular vote and the Electoral College? Will there be challenges and chaos? Will courts get involved? We plan to publish a sampling of responses before Election Day, and later highlight the one that best reflects what happened. The deadline for submissions (no more than 200 words) is Tuesday, Oct. 27, at 10 a.m. Eastern time. Email: letters@nytimes.com Please include your name, city and contact information, and put “prediction” in the subject line. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
