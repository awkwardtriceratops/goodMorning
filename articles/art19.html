Biden Jr.’s plan for winning the presidential election relies on putting together African-American voters of all ages, including younger Black people who are less enthusiastic about him, and white moderates who find President Trump unacceptable. At last week’s Republican National Convention, the Trump campaign appeared to be sowing discord within that coalition. By framing the response to unrest in cities as binary — you are either for violence or for the police — Republicans seemed to be daring Mr. Biden to challenge young Black voters. In a speech in Pittsburgh yesterday, Mr. Biden rejected that choice. Instead, he recognized the grievances of peaceful protesters, while denouncing “the senseless violence of looting and burning and destruction of property.” Today, we examine whether the speech worked — and what it means for the rest of the election campaign. On today’s episode: Alexander Burns, a national political correspondent for The New York Times. TRANSCRIPT Does anyone believe there’d less violence in America if Donald Trump is re-elected? We need justice in America. We need safety in America. We’re facing multiple crises, crises that under Donald Trump have kept multiplying — Covid, economic devastation, unwarranted police violence, emboldened white nationalists. I believe if I were president today, the country would be safer and we’d see a lot less violence and here’s why: I have said we must address the issue of racial injustice. I’ve personally spoken to George Floyd’s family and to Jacob Blake’s family. I know their pain, and so do you. I know the justice they seek, and so do you. An average of a thousand people dying every day in the month of August — do you really feel safer under Donald Trump? Mr. Trump, you want to talk about fear? Do you know what people are afraid of in America? They’re afraid they’re going to get Covid. They’re afraid they’re going to get sick and die. And that is in no small part because of you. Background reading: Over the weekend, protesters and Trump supporters clashed in Portland, resulting in the fatal shooting of a man affiliated with a right-wing group. The shooting immediately reverberated in a presidential campaign now entering its most intense period. In his speech in Pittsburgh, Joe Biden deflected Republican criticism and attempted to refocus the spotlight on the president’s character and leadership in the midst of the pandemic.
