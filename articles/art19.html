By Priscilla Blossom When I turned 35, I briefly entertained the idea of getting pregnant again. The memories of first flutters and baby showers danced in my head. At the store, my eyes fell on adorable onesies and ultrasoft plushies. I yearned for those early new-mom moments, playing peekaboo during diaper changes, rocking a baby to sleep in my arms, sniffing that intoxicating newborn aroma. But then I remembered that was only one sliver of what pregnancy and new motherhood were like for me. In my first pregnancy, at 27, everything that could go wrong did. Early on I had two bouts of unexplained vaginal bleeding. Medically, these frightening episodes are referred to as “threatened abortions.” They both occurred while I was at work, and because I had to leave my post for the E.R., I was subsequently fired. Losing my job meant not only losing my income, but also my health insurance. At a time when I was already terrified of losing my baby, my now-former employer only made my fears worse. Still, my boyfriend and I got married, then moved into a new apartment with room for a nursery, and assumed our happy little family might yet work out. Months later, though, I would go into preterm labor and give birth to my baby girl. Margaret Hope was only 22 weeks, tiny and fragile, and weighing just under a pound. Eight hours later, she was gone. I never even got to see her face while she was alive. For months afterward I tried to make sense of the tragedy, and did everything I could to survive it. The following year I was pregnant again. This time, however, I was going into it with a head and heart full of trauma. We were living at my parent’s house with no room for a nursery — we’d lost our previous apartment because trauma and grief make it hard to earn a living. And now my obstetric paperwork had a new label for me: High Risk. Being high risk means doctors generally pay closer attention to you and your fetus, but it also mars the experience of growing a human. It often means: You’ve been through something difficult, something terrible. Or worse, you might go through it all over again. This second pregnancy was even more stressful and highly monitored than the first: I had weekly transvaginal ultrasounds to measure my cervix, and was placed on pelvic rest at three months (meaning not only no sex, but no orgasms either). I had to have weekly progesterone shots, and at 21 weeks, I had an emergency cerclage (which involves placing a single suture through the cervix to tighten it or keep it from opening well before due date). But luckily, there was a rainbow at the end of it all, and that rainbow was born at 40 weeks and 2 days, weighing just over nine pounds. My husband immediately placed him on my chest, and this time, my baby and I looked into each other’s eyes. It was wild. But having my rainbow baby doesn’t negate everything I often feel I was robbed of. Between prenatal depression and unresolved PTSD, I could never just fully relax into being pregnant. That bliss you feel when you simply don’t know about all the horrible things that could go wrong? I never felt it. Those cute pregnancy announcements that people put on social media? I was terrified to tell a soul about my second pregnancy, because that would mean I had to admit to myself that I was pregnant, and that no matter how many doctors took care of me there was the potential for another loss.
