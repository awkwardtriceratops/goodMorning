The Guards Saw a Blackmail Opportunity.<br></h1><p id="artcont">A Canadian-Iranian software engineer for Facebook, a tech celebrity in his native Iran, visited family in Tehran in January. His recent revelations of what happened next have stirred outrage. By Farnaz Fassihi A Canadian-Iranian software engineer at Facebook, a superstar among technology students in Iran, traveled to Tehran in January to visit his family. It was a trip that would upend his life. A few weeks later, the engineer departed under what he now describes as a coerced deal to act as an informant for the  Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the powerful arm of Iran’s military. The engineer, Behdad Esfahbod, 38, said he was arrested by Revolutionary Guards intelligence agents on the streets of Tehran, held in solitary confinement for seven days and psychologically tortured into promising to cooperate, which he never did. He has since struggled as his mental health, marriage and career fell apart. He said he had considered suicide.
