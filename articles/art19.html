Biden picks Marcia Fudge for housing secretary and Tom Vilsack for agriculture secretary. Arizona Republicans hurl insults at one another after Trump’s loss in the state. With just days in the congressional session, the White House offers Democrats a pandemic stimulus proposal. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is expected to formally name Lloyd J. Austin III, a retired four-star Army general, to lead the Department of Defense. His choice drew immediate opposition on Capitol Hill for breaking with tradition and putting a former military commander at the head of the agency, a position typically filled by a civilian. The move would require a congressional waiver for General Austin, who retired in 2016, short of the requirement that any military veteran be retired from active duty for at least seven years before leading the Defense Department. Civilian control of the military has been a priority in the country since the nation’s founding. At 67, General Austin has been a respected presence at the Pentagon for years and is the only African-American to have headed U.S. Central Command, the military’s marquee combat command, with responsibility for Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Yemen — most of the places where the United States is at war. After retiring, General Austin joined the board of the defense contractor Raytheon Technologies, a position that has also garnered some criticism. Mr. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are expected to formally announce their selection of General Austin, who would be the first Black defense secretary, at an event Wednesday in Wilmington, Del. Their incoming national security team will face immediate challenges in rebuilding international relationships that deteriorated during the Trump administration. They have yet to announce their choices to lead the Central Intelligence Agency and the Justice Department. It could be difficult for lawmakers to reject a waiver for General Austin, especially for those who approved a similar measure for President Trump’s choice four years ago, Jim Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general. But many lawmakers said Tuesday that they did not want the practice enshrined into American political life. Colin L. Powell, the first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and first Black secretary of state, urged Congress to approve a waiver allowing the general to serve. In a statement on his Facebook page, Mr. Powell said that he had been a mentor to General Austin. “General Austin has served splendidly at all combat and civilian levels in the armed forces,” Mr. Powell said. “He has demonstrated his warfighting skills and his bureaucratic, diplomatic and political acumen.” Robert M. Gates, a former secretary of defense under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, also praised General Austin. “He is an extraordinary leader with a deep understanding of the international challenges facing the United States and the Defense Department,” Mr. Gates said in a statement. “From personal experience, I know him to be a person of unshakable integrity, independent of thought and conscience, and a steady hand.” Zach Montague contributed reporting. — Eileen Sullivan and Eric Schmitt One president all but declared victory over the pandemic, hailing new vaccines as a “medical miracle” and congratulating himself for doing what “nobody has ever seen before.” The next president declared the pandemic deadlier than ever, calling it a “mass casualty” event that is leaving “a gaping hole” in America with more misery to come. “We’re here to discuss a monumental national achievement,” President Trump boasted on one screen. “From the instant the coronavirus invaded our shores, we raced into action.” “We’re in a very dark winter,” President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said minutes later in his own speech on another screen. “Things may well get worse before they get better.” Rarely has there been a single hour on a single day that saw such discordant messages emanating from Washington in a time of national crisis. In the middle of a transition of power that has already proved more unsettling than any in more than a century, the departing and incoming presidents on Tuesday offered the American people vastly divergent assessments of the state of their union. The split-screen speeches beamed from the White House and the headquarters of the next administration in Wilmington, Del., could hardly have underscored the differences between the 45th and 46th presidents more starkly. Mr. Trump offered told-you-so triumphalism as he bragged about the “incredible,” “amazing” and “unprecedented” development of vaccines for the coronavirus. Mr. Biden projected feel-your-pain empathy, urged resisters to wear masks and warned that “this mess” would not end quickly. At Mr. Trump’s event, dozens of officials and guests crowded into an auditorium, most of them wearing masks, which is a change for this White House. But they were still not socially distant. The president himself, who was hospitalized with Covid-19 in October, wore no mask as 15 members of his team gathered behind him for the signing of an executive order meant to prioritize the vaccine for Americans over people in other nations. At Mr. Biden’s event, where he formally announced his top health care nominees and advisers, only a handful of people were present, all masked and sitting far apart. Some of those whose appointments he announced beamed in their remarks remotely. Shortly before the event, the Biden team made its regular announcement that the president-elect had once again tested negative for the virus. The contrast comes at a perilous moment for the United States as coronavirus cases keep rising to new peaks, hospitals are overwhelmed with sick patients and the number of virus deaths is spiking. The new vaccines developed on Mr. Trump’s watch may be approved within days. But only health care workers and the most vulnerable Americans will get inoculated in the short term, and most Americans will likely not get access to lifesaving shots until spring. — Peter Baker President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has selected Representative Marcia L. Fudge of Ohio to serve as the secretary of housing and urban development in his administration and Tom Vilsack for agriculture secretary, people familiar with the transition said. Ms. Fudge, 68, joins Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, a retired military officer whom Mr. Biden selected to run the Pentagon, as the second African-American named to the president-elect’s cabinet this week. Both positions require Senate confirmation. Mr. Biden pledged during his campaign to assemble an administration that would “look like America” and has so far selected several women and people of color for key posts. Mr. Vilsack, 69, would return to a post he held during the Obama administration, when he served as agriculture secretary for eight years. A former governor of Iowa who served two terms, Mr. Vilsack was also a key supporter of Mr. Biden in the 2020 presidential campaign, endorsing him before the caucuses there and campaigning with him around the state. Ms. Fudge — who has been a member of the House since 2008, when she won a special election — and her allies in Washington had urged Mr. Biden to nominate her to run the Agriculture Department, where she had hoped to shift the agency’s focus away from farming and toward the issue of hunger in America. Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina and one of Mr. Biden’s most prominent Black supporters, had urged Mr. Biden to put Ms. Fudge at the Agriculture Department. But in the end, the president-elect chose her to lead the nation’s sprawling housing agency instead. Picking Ms. Fudge adds strain on Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose majority in the House had shrunk to a handful of seats after the elections in November. Mr. Biden’s decision means Democrats must win another special election to fill her seat or risk the party’s margin shrinking further. — Michael D. Shear, Thomas Kaplan and Katie Glueck The Republican speaker of Arizona’s House did what he thought was right after Rudolph W. Giuliani rolled through Phoenix for maskless meetings with Republican legislators and then tested positive for the coronavirus: He shut the chamber down for a week in a bid to prevent the spread of Covid-19. But that decision is adding fuel to the open conflict within Arizona’s Republican Party, positioning Trump loyalists intent on overturning the state’s election results against relatively moderate figures including the speaker, Rusty Bowers, and Gov. Doug Ducey, who have each made clear the results will stand. The party this week publicly urged people to fight to the death to overturn the election in which President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. defeated President Trump by fewer than 11,000 votes, about 0.3 percentage points. That entreaty came after 28 current and incoming Republican lawmakers called for the decertification of the election as requested by Mr. Giuliani, the personal and campaign lawyer for Mr. Trump. The quarreling, which has powerful state Republicans openly insulting one another, is bringing attention to the challenges the party faces as Arizona shifts from a Republican bastion to a battleground state. “There’s been a civil war boiling in the Republican Party for a couple of years,” said Marcus Dell’Artino, a Republican strategist in Phoenix. “Now we’re seeing the public part of it.” The infighting has flared after Mr. Giuliani visited Phoenix last week as part of his traveling legal battle contending, without providing evidence, that the election was altered by widespread fraud. Mr. Giuliani spent about 11 hours with several Republican lawmakers in a hotel ballroom, and also met with at least eight during a visit to the Arizona Capitol. Neither Mr. Ducey’s office nor Zachery Henry, a spokesman for the Arizona Republican Party, responded to requests for comment on the public discord. After the party asked its followers on Twitter if they were prepared to die for the cause of overturning the election, Mr. Ducey asserted that the Republican Party was “the party of the Constitution and the rule of law.” “We prioritize public safety, law & order, and we respect the law enforcement officers who keep us safe,” Mr. Ducey said on Twitter. “We don’t burn stuff down. We build things up.” — Simon Romero Just days before Congress concludes this year’s session, the White House on Tuesday offered Democrats a $916 billion pandemic stimulus proposal that would meet their demand to provide some relief to state and local governments and include liability protections for businesses that have been a top priority of Republicans. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been urging the lame-duck lawmakers “to act and act now” to help the slumping economy before he takes office in January. “This situation is urgent,” he said Friday. “If we don’t act now, the future will be very bleak.” The offer from Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, to Speaker Nancy Pelosi was the first time since November’s elections that the Trump administration has engaged directly in talks on Capitol Hill about how to prop up the nation’s flagging economy. It came as lawmakers raced to reach a deal on another round of coronavirus relief before they conclude this year’s session, now expected to happen next week. The plan does not include a proposed revival of $300 weekly enhanced unemployment benefits, though it would extend other federal unemployment programs set to expire in the coming weeks. Instead, it would include another, smaller round of direct payments to Americans, amounting to $600 per person. Democrats have already called the cuts to unemployment insurance benefits “unacceptable.” The original $2.2 trillion stimulus law enacted in March distributed $1,200 stimulus checks and established the enhanced unemployment benefits at $600 a week through July, which President Trump later extended at $300 a week for most workers. The proposal put forward by Mr. Mnuchin would not address the lapsed benefit and would halve the one-time payment. “The president’s proposal must not be allowed to obstruct the bipartisan congressional talks that are underway,” Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said in a statement. The two provisions Mr. Mnuchin singled out as part of his offer — what he called “robust” liability protections for businesses, schools and hospitals, and funds for state and local governments — have been the largest sticking points in efforts to reach a compromise. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
