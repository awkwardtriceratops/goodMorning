To the Editor: Re “Growing Crisis in Postal Service Alarms Voters” (front page, Aug. 16): On May 11, I wrote to my senators and representative expressing my concern that President Trump would attempt to suppress the vote in the fall election. No one replied. And now, three months later, Mr. Trump has publicly stated that he is dedicated to keeping people from being able to vote by mail during this life-threatening pandemic. His administration has already implemented plans for slowing mail delivery by cutting postal workers’ hours and removing sorting machines. That this can be done in broad daylight without every person in both parties speaking out against it is unbelievable. The people’s right to vote is the foundation of our democracy. It is therefore incumbent upon the House and the Senate to fully fund the Postal Service immediately and stop Mr. Trump’s tyrannical attempt to stop the vote. This is not a partisan issue. Our democracy is at risk. Sharron Miller
Norman, Okla. To the Editor: A plea to owners and directors of businesses and nonprofits with a social conscience: Please do not send anything but urgent mail through the post office during the month before the election. This could free up capacity for the post office to handle the deluge of mail-in ballots that need to reach boards of election by Election Day. Seriously, I would be happy to have a mailbox empty of everything but prescription medications, bank notices and other important mail if it would help thwart President Trump’s evil plan to slow down the mail.

Englewood, N.J. To the Editor: While I am no longer shocked by Trump administration policies that imperil our democracy, I am perplexed by its efforts to sabotage the Postal Service to advance its voter fraud narrative and disenfranchise voters. This cynical, ham-handed ploy is destined to backfire given that the Postal Service is one of our most trusted institutions and a vital piece of our social fabric. A suboptimal Postal Service jeopardizes our ability to pay bills on time, to receive medications for health conditions and to strengthen social bonds at this time of spirit-crushing isolation. The consequences are especially dire for the elderly who are not as digitally savvy and connected as younger cohorts. A case in point is my 89-year-old mother. She is missing deadlines for handling key financial transactions and is enduring long delays in receiving medications needed to manage potentially life-threatening conditions. She is so distraught by the chaotic situation that she has vowed to vote Democratic in November — a serious indictment of the administration for a dyed-in-the-wool Republican. Randy Budros
Maplewood, N.J. To the Editor: There is a way for the Postal Service to cut costs and use its work force and resources more efficiently, while also maintaining regular service to all of their customers. Split up the regional delivery areas into two groups. Half of the zones receive the mail on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, the other half on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. This plan would take the pressure off staffing and vehicle use, with minimal compromise to the service that many still rely upon. Eric Schroeder
Bethesda, Md. To the Editor: President Trump and his wife have requested absentee ballots to vote. So every American citizen should have the privilege to do the same. Mark your ballots early! Mail early! That would ease the strain on the Postal Service and thwart Mr. Trump’s attempts to sabotage voting by mail. Nancy P. Nemlich
White Plains, N.Y. To the Editor: Re “Post Office Says Ballots May Fail to Arrive in Time” (front page, Aug. 15): President Trump, let’s make a deal: You assure us that mail-in ballots will be delivered in a timely way, and eligible if postmarked by Election Day. In return, the United States will issue a new postage stamp displaying your image. One stamp will be issued upside-down, making it more valuable, which you get to keep, forever. Alan Goldfarb
