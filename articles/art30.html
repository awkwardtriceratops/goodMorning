Today we’re looking at university outbreaks tied to parties, not classrooms. We also have new data on the parents who are juggling remote learning and full-time jobs. The coronavirus is already spreading through colleges and universities at a frightening pace — and some of the biggest clusters have been at sororities, fraternities and off-campus parties. The Times has linked at least 251 cases of the virus to fraternities and sororities across the country, including in Washington, North Carolina, Berkeley, Calif., and Oxford, Miss. Last weekend at the University of Alabama, in Tuscaloosa, bars and sidewalks were crowded with sorority members and other students reveling in their return-to-school rituals, sparking the fury of university officials. “The basic features of daily life in sororities and fraternities supersize the risk of spreading the virus,” our colleague Amy Harmon told us. The University of Notre Dame announced that it would move to online instruction for at least the next two weeks to control a growing outbreak, with a number of cases connected to two off-campus parties. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill moved undergraduate classes entirely online because of four clusters of infections, including one at the Sigma Nu fraternity house. “The frats are being frats: They are having their parties,” a U.N.C. sophomore told The Times. At least 165 of the 290 cases at the University of Washington’s Seattle campus have been associated with its Greek Row. At Oklahoma State University, an entire sorority is in quarantine after 23 of its members tested positive. Even before the pandemic, fraternity and sorority houses were often semiautonomous zones with limited university oversight. But faulting individual students for partying, rather than creating public health infrastructure, might not be a winning strategy, two professors wrote in The Atlantic last month. At Georgia Tech, students staged a die-in on the first day of classes. The governor is pushing in-person instruction, though the state has the highest rate of reported new cases in the country. Michigan State University moved to online-only teaching for undergraduates for the fall semester, about a week before students were scheduled to move in to campus housing. The University of Alabama has an ambitious plan to reopen based on apps and robust testing, even as local virus rates remain high. New York has enforced strict quarantines on travelers from 33 states. At least 59,000 out-of-state students are scrambling to figure out how to get to campus. As Vermont’s colleges open for the semester, cases of Covid-19 are starting to rise. An entire dorm at Colorado College was quarantined after a student tested positive. A vast majority of parents have resigned themselves to going it alone in the pandemic school year, according to a new survey for The New York Times. Just one in seven parents said their children would be returning to school full time this fall. Four in five parents said they would have no in-person help educating and caring for them, whether from relatives, neighbors, nannies or tutors, according to the survey. Eighty percent of parents who are both working remotely during the pandemic will also be handling child care and education. “All the choices stink,” Kate Averett, a sociologist at the University at Albany who has been interviewing parents nationwide since the spring, told The Times. In families where both parents need to work outside the home, there are obvious logistical challenges. Three-fourths of these parents say they will also be overseeing their children’s education. “As parents, we’re all feeling it individually, and because of the nature of this pandemic, it can start to feel like we’re in it alone,” our colleague Claire Cain Miller, who wrote about the survey, told us. “But everyone’s feeling it, across all demographic lines.” The survey found very few differences based on demographic characteristics like race, location, or the age of children. Mothers, though, are doing most of the planning, and spending the most time caring for and educating the children. And parents with more resources had more options, like taking an unpaid leave or hiring a private teacher or nanny.

Near the U.S.-Mexico border, volunteers are making sure children get a quality education during uncertain times. Our Parenting team offers an in-depth look at home-schooling, a decision made by some families that feels more relevant than ever. On Wednesday, educators in Detroit will vote whether to strike over plans to return to in-person learning. Teachers’ unions in New York City and Chicago are also putting pressure on local officials. There are more than 1,200 job openings for teachers, bus drivers and substitutes in Tennessee, a state that already faced chronic teacher shortages. Many districts have reopened for in-person teaching. In Maine, schools are serving meals for both in-person and at-home learners. In New York City, the union that represents, among others, lunch cooks is putting sustained pressure on Mayor Bill de Blasio to delay the start of school. One preschool in Cleveland, Ohio, is modifying everything — from tooth brushing demos to rug time — to keep kids safe. Utah told The Times that 200,000 packages of disinfectant wipes it ordered for the upcoming school year won’t arrive until mid-September, weeks after some districts have started in-person classes. Connecticut’s largest teachers’ union recommended postponing the start of the school year, despite the state’s low case count. But in New Haven, some want at least some in-person school to start because not all students have access to the internet or computers. Updated Aug. 19, 2020 The latest on how schools are navigating the pandemic. Even though classrooms are opening, most students in the U.S. will spend at least part of the week online. As a parent, there are measures you can take to protect your kids’ health and keep life feeling somewhat normal. Keep your kids’ eyes healthy by enforcing regular breaks and tests when they’re staring into screens for hours on end. Regulating screen time can also help your children sleep better: Bedtime habits have changed worldwide since quarantines started. Psychologically, it can be hard to keep school from bleeding into the rest of the day. Set up a remote learning space at home so your student can keep classroom thoughts out of playtime. Terri Ball, a 52-year-old elementary school teacher in Prescott, Ariz., recently resigned from her job after over 30 years in education. “We are opening up way too soon,” said Ms. Ball, who has several medical conditions. “I love teaching, but not enough to die for it.” She’s not alone. In Salt Lake County, Utah, 79 teachers resigned because of fears about returning to the classroom without adequate protection. We want to hear from teachers making difficult choices.
