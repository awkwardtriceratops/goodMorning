By Margaret Renkl Contributing Opinion Writer NASHVILLE — Tuesday marks 100 years since the Tennessee General Assembly voted to ratify the 19th Amendment, which gave American women the right to vote and shifted the national political landscape as thoroughly as any earthquake, tornado, and tidal wave combined. By Aug. 18, 1920, more than a year had passed since the United States Congress voted to approve the amendment. Thirty-five of the necessary 36 states had already voted for ratification, but there the women’s suffrage effort had stalled. Tennessee was ratification’s last viable hope before the 1920 election, and possibly for the foreseeable future. In a story that is legendary here, the final vote came down to the conscience of one man: Harry T. Burn, a state representative from McMinn County, who was all of 24 years old. Mr. Burn supported women’s suffrage personally, but his most vocal constituents did not and 1920 was an election year. When the governor called a special session of the legislature to consider a motion to ratify the amendment, Mr. Burn headed to Nashville hoping to avoid a vote altogether. TRANSCRIPT This is the Tennessee House chamber on August 18, 1920. The room is full of roses, yellow worn by those supporting women’s suffrage and red by those against. It’s tense. All eyes are on the clerk as he counts the votes. After decades of tireless campaigning and 144 years after Thomas Jefferson declared all white, property-owning men equal, the battle for women’s suffrage came down to a single vote, cast by the youngest member of the legislature, carrying a note from his mother. This vote ratified the 19th Amendment and guaranteed women the right to vote. It’s an incredible story and reminds us of how even constitutional amendments, so national in their scope, ultimately get decided on a very local, human level. It brings politics home. We have one of the world’s oldest and shortest Constitutions. And its authors recognized the need for it to evolve with time. The process is undoubtedly arduous. It took 203 years to pass the 27th Amendment, which revised congressional pay. But it allows we, the people, to determine the law. In 1923, three years after the 19th Amendment was ratified, suffragist Alice Paul proposed a new amendment, one that would declare men and women equal under the law, not just at the polls. It became known as the Equal Rights Amendment, the E.R.A. Today, nearly 100 years later, its passage still hangs in the balance. This year, as we approach the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment’s ratification, the E.R.A. will be a subject of local debate as supporters will work to get the 38th and final state to ratify. Eyes will be on several of the state legislatures who have yet to ratify, including Virginia, North Carolina and Arizona. Its history is fascinating. After it was proposed in 1923, the E.R.A. was presented in every session of Congress for nearly 50 years. In 1940, the Republican Party was the first to include support for the amendment in its platform. When Congress eventually passed the E.R.A. in 1972, it went to the states for ratification. It was quickly approved by 33 states. But the opposition, led by a woman, ran a campaign so strong the amendment was still three states short by the deadline. “By coming here today, you have shown that that is not what American women want.” In recent years, galvanized by the #MeToo movement and the ratification of the 200-year-old 27th Amendment, supporters have pushed for ratification from three remaining states, hoping Congress will adjust the deadline. In 2017, Nevada voted to ratify, followed a year later by Illinois. History is being made. And it’s happening right in our backyards. And that’s why I want to show you this moment, from 1920, in the Tennessee House chamber, when the 19th Amendment hung in the balance. “The Suffragists needed one more vote. And as the fateful roll call began, they had no idea where it might come from. Harry Burn, from McMinn County, the youngest man in the legislature, was cautious. Most of his constituents were against votes for women. And he had come into the chamber that morning with a red rose in his buttonhole. But he also carried, folded in his pocket, a letter from his mother.” “Dear son, vote for suffrage and don’t keep them in doubt. I noticed some of the speeches against. They were very bitter. I have been watching to see how you stood but have not seen anything yet. Don’t forget to be a good boy. With lots of love, mama.” “When the roll call reached him, Harry Burn voted to ratify. His single vote ended 72 years of painful struggle. The 19th Amendment was now law. Women’s suffrage had, at last, been written into the Constitution. And the goal that had first been proposed in Seneca Falls in 1848 had been reached. Asked to explain himself later, Harry Burn said simply, I know that a mother’s advice is always safest for a boy to follow.” I love that story on so many levels. It’s one of the great single deciding votes in our history. And it was cast by a 24-year-old who changed his mind on the spot thanks to a letter from his mother. It’s an interesting echo to the process we’re seeing unfold around the renewed efforts to pass the E.R.A. You know, the most recent vote to consider the E.R.A. was in Virginia in February 2019. Guess how many votes it fell short by? In the sweltering month of August, in an overdressed age without air-conditioning, the Tennessee Senate passed the motion to ratify with a comfortable margin, but legislators in the House engineered one delay after another. As the hot days wore on, lobbying from both sides intensified. In what became known as the War of the Roses, supporters of suffrage wore yellow roses in their lapels; anti-suffragists wore red. Bribes were proffered, whiskey flowed, and previously stalwart supporters defected — legislators who wore a yellow flower on one day might be found wearing a red one the next. On the 10th day of the special session, Mr. Burn received a letter from his mother, Febb Burn, a widow back home in Niota, Tenn. Mrs. Burn urged her son to “be a good boy” and vote for ratification. That morning Mr. Burn, a red rose in his lapel, twice voted to table the motion, but each of those votes ended in a tie. A tie in the actual vote on ratification would consign the motion to defeat, so Tennessee’s anti-suffragist Speaker of the House finally put the motion to ratify up for a vote. And that’s when Mr. Burn, with his mother’s letter in his pocket, switched sides. When the clerk reached his name in the roll-call vote, he responded with a quiet “Aye.” Pandemonium ensued. Harry T. Burn had just broken the tie. The vote to ratify had surely passed. But the drama didn’t end there. Moving down the roll, the clerk came to Banks Turner, a House member from West Tennessee who had voted with the suffragists earlier in the day. This time, however, Mr. Turner sat silent when his turn came to vote. His silence created yet another tie. As nay vote followed nay vote, anti-suffragists rose to their feet, already tasting victory. But after the roll call was complete, Mr. Turner finally spoke. “Mr. Speaker,” he said, “I wish to be recorded as voting Aye.” “There was a long moment of silence, silence and shock,” writes Elaine Weiss in “The Woman’s Hour,” her lively, page-turning account of that summer. “Then an explosion, a roar never before heard in the old statehouse. The chamber shook with screams and cries, with thumping and whooping.” At the very last possible second, Tennessee had just voted to ratify the 19th Amendment. The story, of course, is longer and more complicated than a newspaper column allows, certainly more than fond stories of politically engaged mothers and dutiful sons can account for. As Ms. Weiss notes, the fight for women’s suffrage didn’t end on Aug. 18, 1920. This anniversary has given Nashville an opportunity to provide a fuller picture of the legendary events that happened here 100 years ago. There have been exhibits and special events at the historic Hermitage Hotel, where so much of the lobbying took place in 1920. A brilliant new documentary, “By One Vote,” by Nashville Public Television. A new suffrage monument by sculptor Alan LeQuire. An original opera by the Nashville Opera. Many of these commemorations, and so many others, have been put on hold during the pandemic, but some of them have been modified to allow for safe in-person attendance or have moved online. At the Tennessee State Museum, which follows the governor’s plan for public buildings and is open to the public with special social-distancing guidelines, “Ratified! Tennessee Women and the Right to Vote” is a gorgeous two-gallery exhibit built from archival photos, physical artifacts, documents, and videos, including a wonderful clip from a television interview with Mr. Burn, recorded much later, who explains his reasons for casting a vote for ratification. “Ratified!” tells a more complicated version of the suffrage story, going back much further than the vote for ratification. “One question we wanted to answer for visitors is why there was not a suffrage movement in Tennessee in the 1840s, when the national movement started,” curator Miranda Fraley-Rhodes told me on a tour of the exhibit last week. “And the answer to that is slavery. The suffrage movement really came out of the abolitionist movement, and in the South the whole culture was shaped by the institution of slavery.” Tennessee, like the South as a whole, has a long history of suppressing the vote — a history that is ongoing. But at least some white suffragists here were advocating for interracial cooperation in securing the vote by 1920. The museum’s multimedia displays take special care to highlight the key contributions of Black women like Juno Frankie Pierce and Ida B. Wells. “In Nashville there was very much an effort between leading African-American suffragists and leading white suffragists to work together to help elect reform candidates,” according to Dr. Fraley-Rhodes. To make sure this history is available to Tennesseans who aren’t able to travel to Nashville, the museum has moved an interactive portion of the exhibit online and partnered with the Tennessee State Library and Archives and Humanities Tennessee (my former employer) to create what Ashley Howell, executive director of the museum, calls “an exhibit in a box” — eight panels that tell the story of suffrage and that can be mounted on the wall or on easels. Last week the exhibits were shipped, free of charge, to 87 locations around the state. A few blocks down Rosa Parks Boulevard and up Church Street, the Nashville Public Library’s new Votes for Women room takes a very different approach to presenting and discussing issues raised by suffrage. Votes for Women is a permanent exhibit, with plans for its programming to evolve in response to contemporary issues and current events. Like the library’s magnificent Civil Rights Room, which it echoes in both design and intention, the new Votes for Women Room is partly about history and partly about how to interpret the current moment through the lens of history, said Andrea Blackman, director of both rooms, when she showed me around last week. The centerpiece of the Votes for Women room is an eye-level timeline of photos depicting pivotal moments in the history of women’s quest for equality. The people in the photos are deliberately diverse, said Ms. Blackman: “We asked ourselves, ‘How do we balance race? How do we balance age?’ We want people to walk into this space and be able to see themselves.” Above the timeline hangs a circle of statements by activists from the past hundred years. The first one you notice on entering the room is Gloria Steinem’s famous pronouncement, “Women have always been an equal part of the past. We just haven’t been a part of history.” Next to it is an equally famous exhortation from Shirley Chisolm: “If they don’t give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.” The library, following the mayor’s reopening plan for public buildings during the pandemic, is currently closed to the public, so Votes for Women will launch online Tuesday, with appearances by Rosanne Cash and Nashville’s youth poet laureate, Alora Young. Ms. Blackman, whose background is in education, is already busy sharing its treasures online and inspiring engagement with the questions the exhibit raises. “As long as people continue to push communities to change their thinking, or see that there’s another way to look at something, or challenge history, we’ll continue to have these tough conversations. Why not have them in a place where they can do research to support their arguments, where they can be supported in relating their ideas, and where they will have a backdrop of 100-plus years of activists who were asking those same questions?” “I think, looking at the long history of women’s suffrage, what we can take away is that sometimes change happens over a very, very long period of time,” the University of Memphis historian Beverly Bond observes in the Nashville Public Television documentary. “The wheel of progress just keeps right on turning — with a few maybe backward rotations, but it keeps turning.” Margaret Renkl is a contributing opinion writer who covers flora, fauna, politics and culture in the American South.
