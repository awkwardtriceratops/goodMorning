By Farhad Manjoo Opinion Columnist Now that the ballots have been cast and we wait to see whose will be counted and whose will be ignored, can we please take a moment to acknowledge what a huge mess this whole thing has been? I don’t mean the big things — the absurd twists in the ugly, never-ending, pandemic-blurred, possibly world-ending presidential election of 2020. No, I’m referring to the smallest, most particular act of this saga: the way we voted. The process of registering your democratic preference, the citizen’s core duty in a democracy. Can we take a moment to acknowledge how terribly inefficient, inaccessible, unfair and just plain backward this process remains in the United States? When all the tallying is done, up to an estimated 160 million Americans will have voted this year — a turnout of about 67 percent of eligible voters. That would be a modern record, and given that it occurred as the coronavirus raged, the casting and counting of all those votes should be regarded as an achievement for the United States’ election system. But that’s not a very high bar, and the biggest problem about how America conducts its elections is that we have been too tolerant, for too long, of a bar set way too low. High turnout notwithstanding, the glaring lesson of this year’s election is that we cannot go on this way. From the endless lines to the pre-election legal wrangling to the president’s constant effort to undermine the process, every ballot cast this year was a leap of faith: Would it get there in time? Would it get there at all? Would they try to toss it out because you voted from a car? Would they throw it out because you signed your name carelessly? Would judges be called upon to alter the mail-in deadline after the election had already begun? Would you ever be able to find the one dropbox in your sprawling county? And, after all that, would anyone believe the count, anyway? All of this uncertainty is unworthy of the world’s “oldest democracy.” American elections are broken, and because the legitimacy of the entire political system rests upon our votes, their brokenness mars every other part of our democracy. TRANSCRIPT All right, let’s have a look here. “New Mexico is 49th in unemployment and 50th for schools. We got to bust through some walls to make changes.” [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] “— is to rebuild our infrastructure. And here’s what I think of Trump’s wall.” So awkward. Please play me more. What? Are you kidding me? It is chaotic. It’s crazy. It’s like you want to stop people from voting. This is, it’s stupid. Ugh. I’m done. I’m done. That looks like an ink blot test. This looks like a toilet to me. It looks like a Jackson Pollock. That’s straight-up Jackson Pollock. How do you pronounce that? I don’t even know what that is. Gerrymandering? “Gerrymandering. The art of drawing districts to put as many of your voters together or more often, to make sure the other party’s voters are broken up and scattered.” Well, now when you tell me what gerrymandering is then this sounds like cheating. That’s illegal. I’m sorry, firstly, gerrymandering needs to be illegal. In Australia, redistricting is done by an independent commission, not done by the politicians who won those districts, so it is a lot fairer. “If you haven’t registered to vote, time is running out.” “With registration deadlines as far as 30 days before the election.” What is voter registration? I mean, I know what it is, but I understand, why do you have this kind of thing? In Germany, you don’t need to register yourself for the vote. In Estonia, voter registration is automatic. I actually had somebody who is an election officer come over to my house and help me out with my process of voter registration, and mind you, this is in a country of 1.3 billion people. ”Voter purging is the process by which election officials remove names from the voter rolls.” Come on. No one thinks of a word “purge” and thinks of anything positive. We have seen the “Purge” films. Georgia likely removed nearly 200,000 from voter rolls wrongfully? How? I can’t imagine for this to happen in Germany. Nope, you don’t get to vote. Nope, you don’t get to vote either. Nope. “Voting in America is on a Tuesday. Many people don’t vote, because they are either too busy or have conflicting work or school schedules.” To me, it sounds like 19th century to be honest. What I really appreciate about Germany is it’s so easy for you to go and vote. It’s on a Sunday. It’s on a free day. In India, it’s actually illegal to keep your employees from voting. So in Australia, we have this thing called a “democracy sausage.” You take a selfie with your democracy sausage. You haven’t voted in Australia unless you’ve gotten your democracy sausage. In the last Estonian parliamentary elections, I think I cast my vote during breakfast. I have this identity card. I insert it into a computer reader, pick my candidate, and cast my vote. It took me two minutes. Approximately a minute. Five minutes. Five to seven minutes. Five to 10. Ten minutes. ”Seven hours, 45 minutes, and 13 seconds it took for me.” Wait, wait, wait, it took him the amount of time it will take for me to fly from the U.K., from London to New York. This feels like the opposite of easy to vote. This is not acceptable. It’s just not acceptable in a democratic country, I think. I’ll say 80 percent, just because they’ve haven’t been doing too well recently with everything else. 64 percent. Yeah, that’s not good. That’s almost half of the Americans have no voice. It’s like you want to stop people from voting. Why is that so? ”Somebody please help us. We are at our polling place in Atlanta, Fickett Elementary School. The systems are down.” “Oh look, there’s no line. There’s no line at all, out here in suburban white country.” That’s, for real that’s the reason? Oh. That is the definition of racism. It’s the same in South Africa. If you want to go into a wealthy white community, everything is easy. If you want to go to the township, I don’t even know if you’re going to get to vote. “Moms and dads took their kids, you know, to vote with them doing the civil rights era. How I get to do that now? How I get to take my family with me, and I can go vote with family for the first time, and that means a lot to me.” I think this is the sign of the resilience. That I think is what will protect democracy, if nothing else. But that American spirit, you have to love it. You know, people are still going out there and standing in the queues and standing in the rain. As weird as it sounds, the only way to overcome this is to vote. Fight to vote and then change the system by voting. I will never get up on American life. If people keep the same spirit, keep the same energy, then undoubtedly, a “change is gonna come.” I think Americans should have a democracy sausage. Sure, call it a democracy hot dog if you want to. It tastes like freedom. Tastes like representative power. Fixing how we vote isn’t a mystery. Experts have recommended several specific measures that could greatly expand the franchise, including federal measures to make registration easier, expand early voting and ensure we have adequate resources at polling locations to prevent long lines. The difficulty is, instead, political. For decades, limiting who gets to vote has been a key strategy of the Republican Party — though usually people on the right have not been quite so proud of this fact. This year, as has happened often with Donald Trump, subtext became text. In the weeks before Election Day, Trump all but boasted about the role that voter intimidation and suppression would play in his campaign. “We’re watching you, Philadelphia,” Trump warned in Pennsylvania last week, suggesting something untoward going on with the vote in a city highly unfavorable to his candidacy. “We’re watching at the highest level.” If Democrats win the presidency and the Senate, undoing the Republican bet on disenfranchisement ought to be among their highest priorities. One reason voting remains so onerous is that we rarely think about it except close to Election Day. The further out we get from the vote, the less urgency there is to fix things. But nothing else in a democracy works if voting doesn’t work. So, please, let’s fix voting first. None of the problems we saw this year were new; inaccessibility, confusion, bureaucratic hoop-jumping and outright intimidation have long been hallmarks of American elections. Though politicians speak dreamily of the importance of voting, the United States badly lags other democracies on many measures of electoral success; in many countries, a turnout rate of about two-thirds wouldn’t rank as particularly extraordinary. Voting in this country is also highly unequal. Compared with turnout among whites, turnout among people of color is often lower. It’s hard to argue this isn’t by design, a result of decades of deliberate disenfranchisement and the perpetuation, still, of voter suppression efforts aimed at people of color. But the best way to appreciate the shortcomings in how we vote isn’t by looking at other countries. Instead, compare the act of voting to other modern services. Set against so many less important transactions in American life — ordering a complicated coffee from a national chain, or finding the best sushi place in a town you’ve never visited before — the simple act of casting a ballot is laughably antiquated. Across much of the country, registering to vote is a labyrinth. In most states, if you haven’t remembered to register by Election Day, you’re too late. Not that you’d necessarily know about it. In between elections, it’s become common for states to “purge” voter rolls of people deemed ineligible, a process that many voters only learn about when they show up at the polls and are denied the chance to vote. The system is also fragmented and underfunded, and it suffers from misaligned incentives. In many countries, elections are administered by nonpartisan agencies that set rules for the entire nation. In the United States, elections are often run by elected officials — Republican or Democratic secretaries of state, for instance — and rules about who gets to vote and how they do so differ from state to state. Because states and the federal government do not sufficiently fund the voting system, it is often unable to meet anything more than ordinary demand. In the last few weeks, Americans in many cities have waited hours for the chance to vote, which is both inspiring and a really terrible comment on the state of our democracy. As Amanda Mull noted recently in The Atlantic, in 2020 the act of voting was elevated to that most sacrosanct place in American society — it became feel-good marketing for brands. This year it felt as if just about every brand in America turned giddy about the democratic process. Retailers and fashion designers and restaurant chains couldn’t stop reminding us to “Vote!” But the embrace of voting as a way to project corporate virtue only highlights how little the government has done to promote this supposedly precious democratic act. “As long as America’s leaders decline to make the system-wide changes that would help more people vote, corporations with something to sell will seep into the void,” Mull wrote. She’s right, and it’s terrible. Voting shouldn’t be this difficult or this uncertain. We know what needs to be done to improve the process. And we shouldn’t wait until another election to get it done. Farhad wants to chat with readers on the phone.
