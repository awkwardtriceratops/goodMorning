Supported by By Bradford Pearson In the latest article from “Beyond the World War II We Know,” a series by The Times that documents lesser-known stories from World War II, we look back at how Japanese-Americans who had been interned during the war fared after the Japanese surrender. On the second weekend of May 1946, more than 500 Japanese-Americans arrived at a dusty, ripped-up corner of Los Angeles County adjacent to a Lockheed Corporation bomber factory. Their bags were unloaded and piled next to bulldozers still planing the dirt outside their new homes, a cobbled-together assortment of used federal housing trailers in glistening silver and bland shades of green. As the children — who made up nearly two-thirds of the new tenants — played, their parents and grandparents inspected the homes of the new Winona trailer camp. Fewer than a fifth of the trailers had working stoves, and those that did were in such disrepair that four fires ignited in one day. Broken windows and unlockable doors were common. The only phone was protected by a guard whose stated duty was to secure only the property of the site’s contractors, not its residents. There was no food, electricity or heat. Toilets were housed in a communal building, and not connected to the sewer. “The trailers were so filthy that an animal should not have been expected to live in them,” said Seldon Martin, a Social Security Board official responsible for overseeing the well-being of the occupants, after visiting the camp. “Undoubtedly it was worse than any housing the Japanese had to put up with during evacuation.” A year earlier, those same people had sat in internment camps across the American West. As they searched for their bags in the trailer camp a year later, county officials scrambled around them to arrange meals from a nearby tuberculosis sanitarium. Similar situations played out up and down the West Coast, as tens of thousands of Japanese-Americans returned after more than three years of incarceration. But they weren’t returning to the world they left. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066 paved the way for their removal, Japanese-Americans sold their homes, farms and businesses, often for pennies on the dollar. While incarcerated they worked menial jobs for $12 or $16 or $19 a month — hardly enough to survive on, let alone save for a new beginning. Unable to return to their farms — restrictive covenants and alien land laws often banned Japanese-Americans and their Japanese parents — many who worked on or owned strawberry or lettuce fields before the war moved to Los Angeles and became gardeners, trying to settle into an urban life for the first time in their lives. Los Angeles, which was home to the largest ethnically Japanese community in North America before the war, was changing, too. The War Relocation Authority, the federal agency tasked with operating the 10 internment camps, worked to empty those camps as quickly as possible following Roosevelt’s closure order in December 1944. The W.R.A. shuttered almost all the camps in the fall of 1945. (One camp, Tule Lake, remained open until March 1946 to house “disloyal” incarcerees.) Each internee received $25 and a train ticket to wherever they wanted to go. Housing was strained to the seams across the United States, but the situation in Los Angeles, described by one official in October 1945 as “full of dynamite,” was especially dire. More than 1.3 million people — roughly one out of every 100 Americans — moved to California between 1940 and 1944. The California State Reconstruction and Reemployment Commission estimated that 625,000 new homes would need to be built to accommodate the growth in the five years following the war, including 280,000 in Los Angeles County alone. During the war, Little Tokyo first became a ghost town, then swelled with Southern Black workers arriving for defense jobs; for three years Little Tokyo was known as Bronzeville. It was into this chaos that the W.R.A. planned to unload 1,200 incarcerees each week that fall. By the end of 1945, a month after closing nine of the 10 W.R.A. camps, thousands of Japanese-Americans returned to the West Coast with nowhere to live. Those who couldn’t find other housing took rooms in $1-a-night hostels carved out of prewar hotels and Buddhist temples, or trailers and repurposed Army barracks. Communities with as many as 1,000 residents filled mazes of barracks and trailers in El Segundo, Hawthorne, Burbank, Inglewood and Santa Monica. Even Lomita Flight Strip, an airfield used to house and train squadrons of P-38 fighter pilots 17 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, was converted into housing. To get into Los Angeles to find work required 85 cents each way, and a four-hour round-trip by bus. Charlotte Brooks, a historian, described the camps as “isolated ghettos that perpetuated the hardships of incarceration.” The environment that had forced the trailers’ occupants from their homes in 1942 hadn’t disappeared, either. Frank Kawana was 12 when his family moved into the trailer camp in El Segundo, which sat near North American Aviation’s B-25 bomber plant. One day, as the 5 o’clock whistle blew, Kawana and his father were stuck standing at an intersection while the workers drove off. “It was probably about 10 minutes but it seemed like 10 hours,” Kawana recalled in 2011 to Densho, a nonprofit preserving the history of Japanese-American incarceration. “Every other car would roll down the window” and they yelled “‘Goddamn Japs! Get the hell out of here!’” His father grabbed his hand. “A little bit of him and a little bit of me died that day,” Mr. Kawana said. When it shuttered the internment camps in 1945, the W.R.A. liquidated not only the barracks but also the cots and kitchen equipment from the camps. Some items even found their way to the West Coast’s makeshift housing; it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where a trailer or hostel resident pulled the sheets up at night in the same bed they where they had slept the previous three years. “Because of poverty and restrictive covenants and hostility and fear, Japanese-Americans were forced to take whatever housing they could get,” said Greg Robinson, the author of “After Camp: Portraits in Midcentury Japanese American Life and Politics.” The public sentiment that had driven the decision to remove Japanese-Americans from the West Coast in 1942 hadn’t miraculously disappeared. Los Angeles County refused to hire Japanese-Americans until 90 days after the end of the war, and private-sector discrimination led to former shop owners becoming domestic servants, Robinson said. The state’s produce industry, the lifeblood of many Japanese-Americans before the war, shut out the returning families. The community didn’t fully recover financially from incarceration until the early 1960s, Robinson said, missing out on 15 years of postwar American prosperity. All of this led to an economic hollowing out of the community. In 1941, only 23 of Los Angeles County’s 36,000 residents of Japanese descent received public assistance. By January 1946 that number had climbed to 937. As housing and employment pressures eased, the populations of the barracks and trailer camps slowly began to shrink. In the spring of 1946 the W.R.A. closed its doors and the majority of the trailer camps it oversaw. At the Lomita Flight Strip camp, the agency cut the water lines as 160 residents were scrambling for new housing. Many of them moved into private trailers operated by plant nurseries and seafood companies, their lodging provided in exchange for their labor. Most of the rest were dumped at Winona trailer camp that second weekend in May. Windows were fixed; gas, sewer and power lines connected. The 337 school-age children eventually found classrooms to accommodate them. Families, close to 200 in total, filled the trailers, planting petunias and small patches of grass; the men took advantage of the proximity to Hollywood, its demanding lawns requiring dedicated gardeners. Eventually, families trickled out, skirting Los Angeles County’s restrictive covenants by moving to Black communities like Watts and Crenshaw. Jim Matsuoka lived with his family and more than 100 other Japanese-American families at Los Cerritos trailer camp in Long Beach, where the trailers were “barely fit for human habitation,” he recalled in a 2010 Densho interview. After first living in the camp, his sisters moved to Echo Park. There, the 12-year-old heard a familiar sound for the first time in five years. “I heard the toilet flush,” he said. “It was like: ‘I’m back to civilization. I’m back among living people.’” In the fall of 1947, the last families in Winona were evicted once again. The Federal Public Housing Authority made them a deal: we’ll sell you your trailers if you leave. After paying a discounted $75 to $100 for their trailers, about 100 families took the offer and moved two miles up the road, to an industrial zone the Valley Times, a Burbank newspaper, later generously called a “nameless community.” (A year later, the area would vote to change its name to Sun Valley, drawing the ire of the upscale Idaho ski resort of the same name.) Since the trailers lacked wheels, the F.P.H.A. towed the homes to their new locations for $25, a third of the cost of some of the trailers. In current dollars, the families spent more than $1,000 to start over yet again. For many Winona residents, the move would be the fifth they had made in less than six years. The process of rebuilding began again: new children, more gardens, renewed hope for stability. Homeowners erected picket fences around their tiny trailers, and this time the move stuck. For the next eight years the corner of San Fernando Road and Olinda Street was a bustling Japanese-American community. On weekends children attended Buddhist Sunday school, while during the week they buoyed their regular curriculum with Japanese language lessons. The community sprouted the Valley Japanese Community Center, teaching Japanese dance, song and cuisine. The center opened its own building outside the trailer camp in the early ’50s; it still operates. By 1955 the trailer camp boasted a heated pool, shuffleboard courts, horseshoes and a playground with six swings, tetherball and a sandbox. Then, once again, it was gone. The language of the public notification buried on page four of the June 27, 1955, Valley Times was blunt: “An application has been filed with the commission requesting that the R1 One-Family Dwelling Zone be changed to the M2 Light Industrial Zone.” Within a year the land was sold out from under its residents, the trailer park bulldozed and replaced with warehouses. Families scattered, and with them the memory of the Japanese-American trailer camps: When former residents organized a reunion in 1986, they learned that no one at the Burbank Historical Society even knew the Sun Valley trailer camp had existed.
