By Tracey Tully and Michael Gold TRENTON — The neighbors gathered outside a blue-and-white building in Trenton on Wednesday morning, coming together in shock, anger and grief on a block filled with abandoned homes just two miles from New Jersey’s gilded State House. They came to mourn what they said was another senseless act of violence in a city that has been plagued by them this year. And they came to vent their fury that little had been done to halt the spree. But this killing felt especially brutal given the victims: two young brothers who were slain by bullets shot into their home on Tuesday night. “The children did not deserve to be at the other end of a barrel,” Mayor Reed Gusciora said at a news conference on Wednesday. “And we have to do better as a community to make sure that this does not happen again.” The victims — Gustavo Perez, 16, and Johnny Perez, 8 — were the latest killed in a surge of homicides this year in New Jersey’s capital, a city where many struggle to make ends meet in one of the nation’s wealthiest states. For months, officials and residents in Trenton have been overwhelmed by a spike in violent crime, which many other cities around the country are also grappling with. With about 10 weeks left in the year, Trenton, a city of about 84,000 people, has seen 34 homicides — more than double its total from last year, when 15 people were killed. The city is also close to matching its deadliest year on record; in 2013, 37 people were killed in homicides, according to State Police data. But the death of the two brothers deepened the pain and frustration felt by residents of the East Trenton neighborhood they called home. “How do you kill an 8-year-old child?” asked Leroy Hayes, 64, a neighborhood fixture and handyman. “This neighborhood is just killing after killing after killing, and nobody’s doing nothing.” At least one shooter fired multiple rounds, apparently from the street into the home, striking the two brothers, officials said. Neither the suspected gunman nor a possible motive have been publicly identified. But the city’s police director, Sheilah Coley, said at a news conference that detectives believed the house had been targeted. Mr. Gusciora said the authorities were investigating whether the killings were connected to a family gathering that had taken place in front of the house before the shooting. “We’re at a loss of what transpired at the family gathering, or whether this is gang-related or family-related,” Mr. Gusciora said. The gunfire left a single bullet hole in a second-story window facing the road. Gustavo, the 16-year-old, was struck in the chest, while Johnny was hit in the neck, Ms. Coley said. The boy’s mother and another brother were also home and were not injured, officials said. Jennifer Perez, 19, a close family friend who shared a house with the family several months ago, said that the boys’ mother, who has not been identified, was devastated by the deaths. “She’s stressing right now,” Ms. Perez said. “She lost two. She’s really sad.” Johnny, the younger of the victims, was a second grader at Woodrow Wilson Elementary School who liked to play video games and “loved to laugh,” Ms. Perez said. Her brother, Dante Girjalva, a fourth grader, said he and Johnny would often play with toy cars and trucks. City officials said that Gustavo, the older brother, “was familiar” to the police, but they did not provide more details. Jabril Martin, 21, who lives near the home, said that Gustavo “hung with the wrong people, but all in all, he was a good kid.” The victims’ 16-year-old brother, Antonio, sat outside the house on Wednesday, being consoled by a family friend. The increase in violence in Trenton is a stark reversal after two years of decline. Among the deaths that have drawn more attention recently was that of a longtime state employee, Vernetta McCray, who officials said was struck by a bullet in August as she was returning home from work. Though the spate of shootings has also involved a number of teenagers, Gustavo and Johnny are believed to be among the youngest victims this year. In June, a 12-year-old girl was shot in the stomach on a weekday morning when a shooter opened fire near a playground. She survived her injury. Shootings are on the rise in other large cities across the country, including Chicago, Minneapolis and New York. Some conservatives have linked the violence to recent protests in cities against police brutality and the ongoing debate over the future of policing in the country. Both liberal lawmakers and experts on crime have said that the pandemic has deepened the systemic problems that often fuel gun violence, including poverty and unemployment. At Wednesday’s news conference, Mr. Gusciora and Ms. Coley connected the violence to a number of factors, including fighting between neighborhood gangs and the availability of illegal guns, both of which have been issues for Trenton in the past. But when pressed on what caused this year’s spike, Mr. Gusciora cited the economic and social disruption caused by the coronavirus. “I can’t help but to think that Covid was a contributing factor,” Mr. Gusciora said. “Both because people are out of work, and kids are all at home. So they’re more susceptible to engaging in violence.” Despite its relative wealth, New Jersey has long faced a significant divide between its affluent suburbs and many of its cities, which struggle with high poverty. Mr. Gusciora said that Trenton — where the median household income is $34,000, less than half the statewide average — had acutely felt the effects of the crisis. Numerous social programs had been disrupted, he said, because of a lack of money. The mayor also pointed to the state’s release of inmates from prisons and jails, a move meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus in those facilities, saying that three of the city’s homicides had involved people released under the program. New Jersey also plans to release thousands of additional prisoners later this year, all of whom are within eight months of completing their state prison sentences. Mr. Gusciora said 300 of those people were expected to come to Trenton, which he anticipated could exacerbate the existing strain on the social safety net. Separately, Ms. Coley, the police director, said that the Trenton Police Department had been told by the courts not to make arrests during a period between March and June when the coronavirus was rampant in the state. During that time, crime rose, she said, and officers were forced to “play catch-up” over the summer. Peter McAleer, a spokesman for the court system, said no such guidance was ever issued. The attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. As violence has risen in Trenton, the city has tried a handful of strategies to quell the gunfire. Officials moved to deploy more officers throughout the city and solicited help from the State Police, which has provided additional patrols. In April, the city also imposed a curfew after a particularly violent weekend. That curfew was eased gradually then lifted entirely in September amid opposition from community groups. Outside the Perez’s home, Kathy McBride, Trenton’s City Council president, was harshly critical of the mayor and the Mercer County prosecutor’s office for failing to adequately address the uptick in shootings. She also rejected their explanations for the spike. “We can no longer allow our children, our babies, to become our ancestors,” Ms. McBride said, as she held a toddler in her arms. “While you’re making excuses, our babies are falling into graves.” Mr. Gusciora said that he believed Trenton would have a difficult time confronting its violence crisis without more money for additional police officers and social programs. He called on the state to provide more funds to its capital city but acknowledged sufficient aid was unlikely given that the pandemic left a massive hole in New Jersey’s budget. “All bets are off because of Covid, unfortunately,” the mayor said. “The state has limited resources.” Tracey Tully reported from Trenton, and Michael Gold from New York. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
