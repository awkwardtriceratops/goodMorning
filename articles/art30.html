Efforts to thwart these funds are the true public safety threats. By Mary Hooks and Jocelyn Simonson Ms. Hooks is a co-director of Southerners on New Ground. Ms. Simonson is a law professor who specializes in criminal law and social change. At least 10,000 protesters and ordinary people have been freed from jail and immigrant detention facilities after months of uprisings in which millions of dollars have been donated to nearly 80 community bail funds nationwide. But the backlash has begun. In the last few weeks, news media, ranging from Fox News to The Boston Globe, have maligned the work of community bail funds, which pay money bail in criminal and immigration cases for those who cannot afford it. Reading these stories, it would be easy to conclude that the funds pose a threat to our collective safety. But the opposite is true. Bail funds promote public safety, in small, non-sensationalist ways: They free people from the violence of jail, and allow them to fight their cases while keeping their families, homes and jobs. They build collective power by living out the ways in which the state should be supporting people in need rather than imprisoning them. Over time, this adds up to less violence and more security. The Globe has run multiple stories about a tragic case and statistical anomaly: Shawn McClinton, 39, was charged with kidnapping and rape three weeks after the Massachusetts Bail Fund bailed him out. The face of Mr. McClinton, a Black man, has filled the local papers and made national news. The New York Post felt the need to publish four different mug shot-style pictures of him in one short article. Yet a vast majority of people who are freed on bail return to court without harming anyone, as the Massachusetts Bail Fund recently pointed out in a statement; 93 percent of people there returned to court in 2016 without an arrest of any kind. It is also part of a national push by right-wing groups to smear these funds in the wake of enormous support for them. The incredible growth of bail funds threatens the right, and the status quo, because it underscores the national reawakening around the intersection of racism, police violence and mass criminalization. The Trump campaign has repeatedly tweeted images of mug shots of Black people it claims were bailed out by the Minnesota Freedom Fund, while asserting that the Biden campaign bailed them out because some individual members of Joe Biden’s staff donated to the fund. There is no report, however, that any of the people named by the Trump campaign have been arrested or have harmed anyone since their release. Even if they had, such incidents would be blips in a much larger story. This kind of racist criticism is known as the “Willie Horton effect.” A single act of violence, especially when connected to the dog-whistle of a Black man’s mug shot, is used to derail larger efforts at promoting safety outside of the criminal system. Focusing so intently on one act obscures the everyday mass violence that the criminal legal system does to millions of people. It takes only a few days in jail for someone to lose her home, job, car, children, physical safety — and, during the pandemic, even her life. Consider Lisa Clinton, a 42-year-old formerly incarcerated Black woman in Atlanta. In 2018, she was accused of stealing $80 worth of food and clothing for her and her five children when she was facing eviction. Ms. Clinton could not afford the $1,600 bond set in her case, and she expected to spend months or years waiting in jail for her case to be resolved. It’s a situation that nearly half of a million people in the United States face every day. People held in pretrial detention are disproportionately Black: 43 percent, even though Black people make up only 12 percent of the general population. Ms. Clinton, though, was bailed out by Southerners on New Ground (SONG), as part of the Black Mama’s Bail Out Action. Once Ms. Clinton was at home, she was given support to help her care for her family and fight the eviction. Like many bail funds and bailouts, SONG has an abolitionist vision of pushing toward a world without prisons by supporting people so they’re safe in their own communities. The group helps people find things that the state should be helping them access instead of criminalizing them: housing, health care, counseling and other basic needs that keep people from being harmed and harming others. Community bail funds are temporary infrastructure, not permanent solutions to the crises of poverty and criminalization. Ms. Clinton soon went to a strategy meeting at SONG, where she says she was “blown away.” She added, “I never knew there were people taking action in solidarity with people like me.” Bail funds often engage in broader organizing and political work — pressuring district attorneys to stop asking for exorbitant bail, working to pass legislation that would end the use of money bail, pushing for decriminalization of “quality of life” and other offenses, and calling for the redistribution of state resources away from punishment and toward collective care. Ms. Clinton jumped into the work, and she was eventually hired as the regional bailout coordinator. In that role, she pays bail for people and provides supportive services. This year, she launched her own initiative, R.E.S.I.S.T., raising money to buy land on which to build healing, sustainable cooperative housing for formerly incarcerated women.
