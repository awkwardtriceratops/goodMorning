RIGHT NOW Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana drew comparisons to Hurricane Rita, which caused an estimated $25.2 billion in damage when it hit Louisiana and Texas in 2005. TRANSCRIPT We expect it to be out of the state of Texas after about a day. So we are anticipating that the storm itself will be out of Texas perhaps as early as the end of Thursday. That said, there will be a lot of devastation wrecked upon Texas as the storm sweeps through, especially east Texas, as well as lingering challenges that will result. If you are subject to one of these evacuation orders, you need to be doing all you can to make sure that you take the action that needs to be taken to protect your life. Those who stay behind may be caught in a situation where rescue teams may be challenged, and being able to rescue from a situation that could cause you to lose your life. So please heed local warnings so that you can take the action in advance that is needed. Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana doubled down in his warning to residents on Tuesday of the danger posed by Hurricane Laura as it barrels toward the Gulf Coast. He described a storm that would pound the region with powerful winds and heavy rains and threatens as much as 13 feet of storm surges on some parts of the coast. “This is a major hurricane,” Mr. Edwards, a Democrat, said during a briefing on Tuesday. “It’s going to be a large, powerful storm.” He said it was expected to make landfall early Thursday, and officials have told more than 500,000 people in Louisiana and Texas to evacuate. The governor drew comparisons to Hurricane Rita, which caused an estimated $25.2 billion in damage when it hit Louisiana and Texas in 2005. He said Laura resembled Rita in its intensity and expected path. “That point of reference sometimes helps people understand the seriousness of the situation,” Mr. Edwards said. Tracking Hurricane Laura on its path toward the Gulf Coast. The region had been bracing for Tropical Storm Marco, but it significantly weakened before making landfall on Monday evening. Now the focus is on Laura, which has unleashed heavy rainfall across Cuba and Jamaica. Hurricane conditions are possible from San Luis Pass, Texas, which is south of Houston, to Intracoastal City, La., according to the National Hurricane Center’s Tuesday afternoon update. Officials said the wind was likely going to be considerably stronger than they had originally expected, with the storm forecast to intensify into a Category 3 storm before making landfall. Benjamin Schott, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said there was “little to impede its development” as it approaches the coast. Officials urged residents to get out of harm’s way and to do so soon, as the winds and rainfall could arrive as early as Wednesday afternoon. “Anyone attempting to travel during the storm is putting their life at risk,” Mr. Schott said. City and county officials in Texas and Louisiana have issued evacuation orders affecting hundreds of thousands of residents, particularly those living in low-lying areas. These orders, some of them voluntary, include parts of Orange, Jefferson and Chambers Counties, as well as Galveston, Texas, and the Texas A&M University campus in the city. Port Arthur, Texas, which has the nation’s largest oil refinery, and Cameron Parish, La., just across the state line, issued mandatory evacuation orders. Oil and gas companies have withdrawn workers from offshore production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Portions of Jefferson, Lafourche and Plaquemines Parishes in Louisiana have also told residents to evacuate. On Tuesday, Lina Hidalgo, the top elected official of Harris County, Texas, which includes Houston, issued a voluntary evacuation order for residents in coastal portions of the county on Galveston Bay, including Baytown, Seabrook, Nassau Bay, Friendswood, and parts of Pasadena and Clear Lake. South Houston was not included in the order, although Ms. Hidalgo had initially mentioned it. “Let me make this as clear as possible: All of us need to be prepared for the very real potential of a direct hit from this storm,” said Ms. Hidalgo, whose title is county judge. “This is truly when we have to say, prepare for the worst.” Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas also mobilized more than 70 members of the Army and Air National Guards and the Texas State Guard to help local, state and federal officials with the storm response. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice said in a statement that staff had begun evacuating several facilities on Monday. Prisoners and employees were transported with N-95 masks and personal protective equipment because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections has already moved more than 1,300 inmates. Laura was approaching the United States on the anniversary of another major Houston-area storm, Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in Texas on Aug. 25, 2017, lashing the Gulf Coast with extensive flooding and causing nearly $125 billion in damage. At a briefing on Tuesday afternoon, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said that Laura was not likely to be a “replica” of that earlier monster storm but that it was expected to be more of a “wind event” than Harvey was. The governor warned Texans to move swiftly to protect themselves and their property and to “be very aware” of surging water, which is predicted to engulf much of coastal East Texas. “It can easily sweep you away, causing you to lose your life,” Mr. Abbott warned. The storm is also likely to spawn tornadoes and leave a “lot of devastation” as it roars through the state, he said. Mr. Abbott added 36 more counties to a state disaster declaration, on top of the 23 that he had listed before. Thousands of emergency workers, including the National Guard, were poised to spring into action with motorboats, aircraft and other equipment when the storm hits. The governor described Laura as a fast-moving storm that could be out of the state after about a day, possibly by the end of Thursday. The governor evoked the successful rebuilding effort in the aftermath of Harvey, one of the most destructive storms on record. “We were bruised, but we were not broken,” he said. As Hurricane Laura approaches, officials are urging residents not to drop their guard against the coronavirus. “Remember, just because a hurricane is coming to Texas, does not mean that Covid-19 either has or is going to leave Texas,” Gov. Greg Abbott said at a briefing on Tuesday, reminding residents to continue maintaining social distance and wearing face masks. “Covid-19 is going to be in Texas throughout the course of the hurricane,” he noted. Although large shelters are being set up throughout the hurricane zone, the governor encouraged evacuees to consider booking rooms in hotels and motels instead of using shelters, as a safer way to isolate themselves from others who might be infected. Governor Abbott and Chief Nim Kidd of the Texas Division of Emergency Management said buses used for evacuations would carry fewer people than in the past, to allow riders to stay a safe distance from one another. Planners are bringing in more buses than in previous disasters, to make up for carrying fewer people on each bus. Traditional shelters like gymnasiums and convention centers that have hosted hundreds of evacuees in past disasters will be set up to provide “layers of separation” between the occupants, Mr. Abbott said. The shelters and buses will be supplied with hand sanitizer and personal protective equipment like face masks, and state officials plan to dispatch testing teams to the larger shelters. “The state and local governments are fully aware that they are dealing with a pandemic while they are responding to Hurricane Laura,” the governor said. Tropical Storm Laura made landfall in western Cuba on Monday night, churning through the provinces of Artemisa and Pinar del Rio. Damage was being assessed Tuesday morning, but no casualties had been reported. The storm tore through the eastern part of the island on Sunday night, stripping away tin roofs in Guantánamo province and collapsing a bridge in Granma province, before tracing the length of the island about 50 miles from the southern coast. As the storm moved west, electricity was cut as a precaution to many provinces. Across Cuba’s southern coast, Laura toppled trees and telephone posts and downed power lines. The island’s Civil Defense Force oversaw the evacuation of 334,000 people. Thousands were moved to emergency shelters, but most took refuge with relatives. Though clustering may cause a spike in coronavirus infection rates, authorities said they felt their primary duty was to protect people in coastal areas from the storm. Laura tore through banana and coffee plantations in the eastern part of the island and damaged crops in the province of Artemisa, a major source of root vegetables for the capital. Food supplies in Cuba have been dicey in recent months: over the last two years, sanctions imposed by the Trump administration have blocked gasoline deliveries from the country’s main ally, Venezuela, leading to a decrease in domestic food production. Although people in Havana had braced for a tough night, the eye of the storm passed more than 60 miles to the west. As electricity flickered back on Tuesday morning, people in the capital awoke to a rainbow. When Hurricane Laura comes ashore, Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana predicted on Monday, it could be similar in intensity to Hurricane Rita, which struck the Gulf Coast on a similar track about a month after Hurricane Katrina pounded New Orleans in 2005. Rita made landfall on Sept. 24, 2005, as a Category 3 storm with sustained winds of 120 miles an hour. It spawned an estimated 90 tornadoes as it pummeled Louisiana, Mississippi and eastern Texas, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm dumped as much as 15 inches of rain in some areas, and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses. Storm-surge flooding swept as far east as the Florida Keys. Rita was the third hurricane to reach Category 5 strength during the deadly and destructive 2005 storm season. It caused an estimated $10 billion in damage in the United States, according to the hurricane center; it killed at least seven people directly, with another 55 deaths attributed indirectly to the storm, including a bus accident during the evacuation in the Texas. More than three million people tried to flee the Houston area and other parts of coastal Texas during a chaotic evacuation that choked major highways and stranded people in their cars. The evacuation become a case study for what to avoid in storm planning and hurricane response. Saturday will mark 15 years since Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast, overwhelming a poorly designed levee and drainage system and swamping much of New Orleans. But unlike the storm’s 10th anniversary, when current and former presidents visited and the city drew international attention, the commemorations this year will mostly be understated. The anniversary tributes were scaled back long before Hurricane Laura, which is expected to come ashore west of New Orleans, had formed in the Gulf of Mexico. The city has been slammed by the coronavirus, which has killed nearly 600 New Orleans residents so far, and sickened thousands more. The mayor, LaToya Cantrell, is planning to attend a wreath-laying ceremony at the site of one of the levee breaches, as she does every year, but there is nothing else formally planned by the city. An annual ceremonial march that usually ends in a large rally is going forward, but will be live-streamed so “if you’re sick or have Covid you can stay home and just watch it online,” said Sess 4-5, a hip-hop artist who organizes the march. Robert Green Sr., who lives in the Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood and lost his mother and a granddaughter in the floods from Katrina, planned processions in past years and initially had ambitious ideas for this year’s edition. He invited people from across the country who had come to New Orleans over the past decade and a half to help rebuild homes. The procession is still happening, but without the out-of-own guests. “Weather’s not going to be an issue,” Mr. Green said. “Covid is going to change the way that we do it.” Still, he added, “every family that lost something is going to remember that day. It’s not going go by the wayside.” After a record number of tropical storms formed in the Atlantic Ocean in June and July, with five striking the United States, government scientists updated their forecast for the remainder of the hurricane season, saying it was likely to be extremely busy. “It’s shaping up to be one of the most active seasons on record,” Louis W. Uccellini, director of the National Weather Service, said on Aug. 6. Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane season forecaster with the Climate Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said there could be 19 to 25 named storms — those with sustained winds above 38 miles an hour, or 61 kilometers an hour — before the season ends on Nov. 30. Of those, seven to 11 could be hurricanes, with sustained winds of 74 m.p.h. or higher, including three to six major ones. “We’ve never forecast up to 25 named storms before,” Dr. Bell said. Even so, he said, it was unlikely that the 2020 season would be as active as 2005, when there were 28 named Atlantic storms and the Weather Service had to resort to using the Greek alphabet to name the last few.

Typically about 95 percent of named Atlantic storms occur between mid-August and the end of October, the period when ocean temperatures reach their peak and atmospheric conditions off the coast of Africa favor storm formation. Laura is the 12th named storm of the 2020 season, and Marco the 13th, though Marco reached the U.S. mainland ahead of Laura. Adam Sobel is an atmospheric scientist and the director of the Initiative on Extreme Weather and Climate at Columbia University. While there is considerable support that warming oceans are making the hurricanes that do occur produce more rain, stronger winds and worse coastal flooding, it has not been clear that it is producing more storms. Decades ago, we used to think a hotter planet should have more hurricanes because storms like warm ocean water. It turns out it is not that simple. Hurricanes form over the warmest waters on the planet, but as the entire ocean warms, the sea surface temperature threshold needed for storms to form also rises. That is for the planet as a whole. But the Atlantic Ocean is a special case, both because some of us live near it, and because its climate has some unique features. The Atlantic has experienced large swings in hurricane activity: The 1950s and 1960s were very active, then the 1970s and 1980s were quiet, and then things picked up again. Those have historically been viewed as natural cycles, implying that we could expect the relatively active period we are in to eventually end. But there is increasing evidence that the quiet decades were caused by aerosol pollution — tiny particles originating from sulfur out of American and European smokestacks that cooled the ocean by reflecting sunlight. That pollution has been reduced by environmental regulation, and with increased greenhouse gases warming the Atlantic, returning to a low-hurricane period may be less likely. The Atlantic is also influenced by the Pacific Ocean. Atlantic hurricanes tend to be suppressed in El Niño years and active in La Niña because of how those Pacific phenomena affect the jet stream. Climate models have predicted that our warmer future will on average see an El Niño Pacific more often, giving us a reason to predict fewer Atlantic hurricanes. New research by some of my colleagues, though, has made a persuasive case that the models are wrong, despite their consistent predictions for the Pacific. If so, our expectations for the future of Atlantic hurricanes may have been far too sanguine.
