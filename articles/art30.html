But that may be beginning to change. By Mark Leibovich Mr. Leibovich is the chief national correspondent for The New York Times Magazine. WASHINGTON — Sitting in the back of his limousine after an appearance on “The Tonight Show,” Donald Trump was explaining to me why he never had much use for Jimmy Carter. “Jimmy Carter used to get off Air Force One carrying his luggage,” Mr. Trump said, smirking. “I don’t want a president carrying his luggage.” It sends the wrong message, Mr. Trump believed, for a president to act like some kind of humble servant, an everyday slob. A commander in chief should be imperial and, yes, superior. “I don’t want someone who is going to come off carrying a large bag of underwear,” Mr. Trump said. It was late in 2015, Mr. Trump was the unlikely front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, and I was following him around for a profile I was working on. I was struck by how someone with such an obsessively cultivated image as a gold-plated know-it-all could appeal to a base made up heavily of white blue-collar workers, union-affiliated and non-college-educated voters — a stark departure from Republican coalitions of the recent past. Even the most aristocratic of American presidents had at least pretended to share the folksy tastes of “ordinary” voters — George H.W. Bush and his pork rinds, for instance. It might have been unconvincing, but at least it seemed polite. As Mr. Trump’s limo inched away from 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Hope Hicks, his not-yet-famous communications director, pointed at a group of fans running up Sixth Avenue in pursuit. “Look at these people,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s literally a little bit sad.” I’ve thought about this episode a lot during Mr. Trump’s tumultuous term in office and possibly imminent comeuppance at the polls. It’s hard not to wonder how he really feels about his supporters, especially when the coronavirus-positive president began walking maskless around the White House. He has been, to say the least, careless about placing his most devoted people at risk. These include his own top White House and campaign aides, residence staff members, Secret Service agents, Republican senators and campaign advisers, and possibly donors at a fund-raising luncheon in New Jersey and rallygoers in Minnesota (depending on when he first thought he might be contagious). On Friday news broke that he was planning to hold a rally for hundreds this weekend on the White House lawn. Several people who have dealt extensively with Mr. Trump have suggested that he takes a dubious, even disdainful view of his most loyal followers. He takes them for granted because he knows they would forgive him for anything: “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any voters.” “The people Trump despises most love him the most,” said Howard Stern, who hosted Mr. Trump on-air for years, in May. His voters, Mr. Stern said, are people he would not want in his hotels. “He’d be disgusted by them,” he said. “Go to Mar-a-Lago, see if there’s any people who look like you. I’m talking to you in the audience.” In his recent memoir, the longtime Trump fixer Michael Cohen described the contempt with which his boss would speak about evangelical Christians, perhaps the president’s most durable corps of supporters. After a meeting with a group of pastors in 2011, Mr. Cohen says Mr. Trump asked him: “Can you believe this [expletive]?” Until recently, it had been easy to consign the question of how Mr. Trump sees his supporters to the black hole of speculation about his true motivations, if anyone still bothers with that. In a broad political sense, Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus has clearly driven away swarms of older voters, traditionally the Republican Party’s most bedrock constituency, who polls now show overwhelmingly support Joe Biden. As a general rule, saying that the coronavirus would “just disappear” or “go away” and that Mr. Trump himself feels 20 years younger after being treated for it is not going to play well with the demographic group — aged 65 and older — that accounts for roughly 80 percent of coronavirus deaths.
