Filing<br></h1><p id="artcont">The company’s performance renewed questions about whether “gig economy” businesses can turn a profit. By Erin Griffith and Peter Eavis SAN FRANCISCO — DoorDash, the largest food delivery start-up in the United States, revealed on Friday that it is losing money even as the coronavirus pandemic has spurred a huge surge in orders, according to financial documents released as the company prepares to go public. The San Francisco company’s performance renewed questions about whether “gig economy” businesses, which rely on armies of contract workers, can turn a profit. DoorDash’s service primarily connects restaurants, drivers and customers to facilitate takeout orders. DoorDash reported revenue of $1.92 billion in the nine months through the end of September, more than 200 percent above the $587 million for the same period last year, according to the prospectus filed for its planned initial public offering. The company’s net loss in the first nine months of this year was $149 million, compared with a loss of $533 million a year earlier. In a clear sign of the pandemic’s effect, DoorDash had 543 million orders through September of this year, compared with 181 million in the same period a year earlier. The prospectus did not specify the value of shares that DoorDash would sell. The start-up was valued at $16 billion as part of a $400 million private funding round in June. It has raised nearly $3 billion in total capital, according to Pitchbook, which tracks start-up funding.
