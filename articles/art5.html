A slender, charismatic 52-year-old with salt-and-pepper hair, Garza has spent the past 30 years wooing and mobilizing Hispanic conservatives, first for the Republican Party and now for the Libre Initiative, an organization he started with the Charles Koch Institute in 2011. He regularly opines on political happenings for Univision, Telemundo and PBS as president of Libre. I have seen him speak before hundreds of Latino entrepreneurs and mingle with scores of politicos at White House events. In Atlanta, however, he faced a tiny audience. Fewer than a dozen souls put on face masks and gathered in an office that Monday morning for Garza’s pep talk, which was followed by a little phone-banking and a few hours of door-knocking. “Georgia right now stands at that intersection that it can decide the future of this country,” Garza said. According to the political-research firm Latino Decisions, 160,000 Hispanics cast votes in the presidential election in Georgia. While most of those votes went to the Democratic candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden, 28 percent went to President Trump, two percentage points higher than Senator David Perdue’s share in the election. Garza believes that with targeted and sustained outreach, Perdue can significantly improve his performance among Hispanics. The choice, Garza told the staff assembled before him, was stark. Either America would exist as “a free society, a free market, a free people” — “libre” means “free” in Spanish — or the nation would find itself in a future where “we’re going to look to government as the remedy to every social ill under the sun.” He mentioned school choice, deregulation, private health care and an odd troika of historical heroes: the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, the Mexican president Benito Juárez and the American president Thomas Jefferson. This mash-up put me in mind of Sir Isaiah Berlin, the political philosopher who once noted that “freedom” would always be a favorite word among both revolutionaries and moralists because “it is a term whose meaning is so porous that there is little interpretation that it seems able to resist.” Libre’s work in Georgia began in earnest last year, when it hired David Casas, a Republican former state representative, to develop its relationships with local Latinos. During the 2020 campaign season, however, Georgia’s fledging chapter was an afterthought. It did not officially endorse any candidate, though Casas helped Americans for Prosperity, the political arm of a Koch-engineered network of affiliated libertarian organizations, in its efforts to re-elect Perdue. Instead Libre targeted Senate races in Colorado, North Carolina and Texas, as well as dozens of down-ballot races and measures throughout the country. It began knocking on doors for Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina nearly a year before the election. While Libre officially sat out the presidential contest, Garza knew that these efforts would assist Trump. “The turnout we do for Tillis is helpful to the president indirectly, because we’re turning out conservatives who are aligned,” he told me. Two of the three Senate candidates Libre supported this year won. Garza’s visit to Atlanta marked Libre’s decision to redirect all its resources to Georgia for the next two months. “David Perdue,” Garza said, “has proven himself to be that type of leader who would rather choose a free society.” (He said nothing about the other Republican senator facing a runoff, Kelly Loeffler, who co-sponsored a very restrictive immigration bill last year and supported Trump’s trade war with China.) Libre staff members from Colorado, Florida, Nevada and North Carolina will knock on doors around Atlanta, Valdosta and Dalton. Its “adopt a state” program will build virtual phone banks, using out-of-state Latino volunteers to call Georgians identified by its voter database. “Half of it is turnout of people that we know who are aligned,” Garza told me, “and half of it is persuasion.” Nearly one million Latinos now live in Georgia, and more than 8 percent of Georgians speak Spanish at home. Georgia’s Latino population began rising in the 1970s as Mexicans and Mexican-Americans came to harvest crops, make carpets and process chickens. Atlanta contractors recruited Mexicans to help finish the city’s construction projects for the 1996 Summer Olympics, accelerating the settlement of Latinos in the state. “Fifty years ago, you would have been hard-pressed to find a Mexican restaurant,” says Charles Bullock, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia. But now, he says, a midsize bus station in Mexico might list Dalton and Atlanta as destinations, alongside Houston and Chicago. Over the past 20 years, Latinos have played an increasingly important role in national elections. From 2000 to 2018, they made up 39 percent of the growth in the national electorate; this year, for the first time in a presidential election, the number of eligible Latino voters was greater than the number of eligible African-American voters. In Arizona, Florida, Nevada and Texas, they may have accounted for 20 percent of the vote, and their percentages also at least doubled in Arkansas, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin (though in this group of states, their part of the electorate remained in the single digits). The ability to connect with and turn out Latino voters has now become an immense advantage in close elections, both locally and nationally, because Latino citizens, as a group, can add up to a deciding margin. Perdue’s runoff seems tailor-made for Libre’s expertise in affecting tight electoral contests in areas with significant Latino populations. In the last eight presidential elections, the national Latino turnout rate has crossed 50 percent only once. In Georgia, Latinos performed better in 2016 — reaching 54 percent turnout — but they dropped back down to 43 percent during the 2018 midterms, suggesting that their participation in the Senate runoffs on Jan. 5 is far from assured. “It’s a really odd time to have an election,” says M.V. Hood III, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia. “We’ll see how tuned-in people stay.” Early voting, which was popular among Latinos during the presidential contest, will take place during the holiday season. All of this means that targeted turnout efforts like Libre’s will be more important than ever. “It’s going to come down to turnout,” Garza told me. “That bodes well for the G.O.P.” Libre has become adept at two critical skills: figuring out which Latino voters it wants to cast ballots and persuading them to do so. In both cases, it relies on a sophisticated voter database that it has been improving for more than a decade through petitions, surveys, classes and mailers. If most Latino voters regularly went to the polls, it would be harder for Libre to play the margins in a tight race. As it is, Latinos’ low turnout, large numbers and complicated political views make them a perfect electorate to cherry-pick for desired results. Going into the 2020 election, progressives still cherished the fantasy that Latino voters across the country would line up behind Democrats en masse. Several Southwestern states with large Latino populations — Arizona, California, Nevada and New Mexico — did give their electoral votes to Biden. In Arizona, Democrats flipped a Senate seat. Even in Pennsylvania, Latinos’ nearly 300,000 votes might have been decisive in Biden’s win. But in several states where Democrats thought they would get a boost from Latino voters, they lost. Florida and Texas each went to Trump, just as they did in 2016. In Florida, Republicans also gained two House seats. Matt A. Barreto, a co-founder of Latino Decisions, argues that Trump’s increase in Latino support was really a function of his exceptionally poor performance among Latinos in 2016. Trump’s anti-Mexican remarks and his scorched-earth tactics against two Cuban-American senators, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, during the Republican presidential primary alienated many Latino conservatives. The so-called surge in Latino votes for Trump in 2020 has simply put him back in line with the average performance of previous Republican presidential candidates. Even so, the result offers clear evidence that Republicans were able to bring Latinos back into the fold during Trump’s time in office — a possibilty that Garza noted to me during our first meeting, shortly after the 2016 election. At the time, this seemed like a counterintuitive prediction, to say the least. But over the years, as I observed Libre’s work in several states, I saw how it was accomplished. Libre has been playing a long game: training activists, building relationships and nurturing a new generation of conservative Latino leaders. “This is a battle of ideas,” Garza told me, “because ideas have consequences, and the consequences can be devastating.” Libre’s operations in Georgia are still taking root. But in October, 10 days before the 2020 election, I went to see how Libre’s more established get-out-the-vote efforts proceeded around Orlando, Fla., a region densely populated with Puerto Ricans and South American immigrants. That Saturday, I followed along as Garza knocked on doors with a staff member named Juan M. Martinez. Martinez is originally from Puerto Rico, and like many of the Libre staff members and volunteers I met over the years, he first heard about Libre in his church. By 2014, he was working for Libre as a contractor, going door to door and making phone calls to help defeat Representative Joe Garcia and send his Republican challenger, Carlos Curbelo, to Capitol Hill. In 2016, Martinez and Libre helped Rubio during his last-minute bid for re-election to the Senate. And in 2018, Libre helped Rick Scott, the state’s Republican governor, eke out a win over Senator Bill Nelson. This summer and fall, Martinez knocked on doors for eight hours a day, three days a week, sometimes doing as many as 400 houses a day. The Trump campaign was also going door to door in Florida, but Biden’s campaign discouraged knocking on doors because of the coronavirus pandemic. On the morning we climbed into Martinez’s rectangular black Scion (a.k.a. “the Toaster”), he was rallying voters for Jason Brodeur, a Republican facing a tight State Senate race against his Democratic opponent, Patricia Sigman. As always, Martinez’s efforts were guided by a tablet loaded with an app powered by i360, a Koch-affiliated data-analytics company, that draws on consumer data and voter information to predict voters’ behavior. The app divides neighborhoods into “books” that can be canvassed in a single outing. That day, Martinez chose a book near the border of Seminole and Orange Counties. “I was reading an article that said that this area is going to decide which way Florida goes on the election,” Martinez said as he drove. The area is dense with Democratic voters who would need to turn out in strength for Biden to win. “Well, let’s see what we can do about that,” Garza said, chuckling. A lot goes into deciding whether Libre will get involved in a race. “It’s sort of a collective decision,” Garza once explained. Libre’s policy team vets candidates’ voting records, while its communications team studies their public statements. Garza also discusses decisions with Emily Seidel and Tim Phillips, the chief executive and the president of Americans for Prosperity, as well as leaders of other Koch-affiliated groups. But the decisive criteria for Libre is simply: Can its efforts potentially tip a race? If i360 indicates that Libre doesn’t stand a chance of influencing an outcome, Libre sits out the contest. Because its educational arm, the Libre Institute, has permanent operations in the field all over the country, its staff can monitor how races shift from month to month before deciding whether to switch on their political activities, which are directed by their 501(c)(4) advocacy group, the Libre Initiative, and their political-action committee, Libre Action. Even if Libre begins campaigning only two months before an election, its efforts can be effective, because its infrastructure, staff and community relationships are already in place. Martinez parked the Toaster in a suburban development sprinkled with Biden-Harris and Trump-Pence signs. He was about 15 minutes into his work when we approached a house with two trucks in the driveway and a giant Halloween spider mounted over the garage. A gray-haired man wearing a tank top emblazoned with an American flag appeared between the trucks. “Is Jennifer available?” Martinez asked. The man eyed him skeptically. “We’ve already voted,” he said. “And there’s a sign at the front of the street that says ‘No Soliciting.’ You shouldn’t be here.” Then he spotted the Brodeur signs in Martinez’s hand. “You’re going door to door for that piece of [expletive]?” The man looked outraged. “He took money from the opioid companies! He voted for that unemployment! He’s one of those who got us into this mess!” His little dog chased us as we backed off. “Leave them alone or eat them,” the man commanded. “That’s the first time that’s happened to me,” Martinez said in Spanish when we were a block away. Two houses later, he received a friendlier reception from a woman wearing glasses and a teal shirt.
