By Tessa Paoli and Nina Sparling Good morning. Today, we have another dispatch from the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism, written by Tessa Paoli and Nina Sparling: Anita Nadolsky, 59, thought she had finally caught some luck. In May she became one of several dozen homeless people in Tuolumne County to get shelter through Project Roomkey, a much-publicized California program intended to move medically vulnerable people out of homeless camps and shelters and off the streets as a way to reduce the spread of Covid-19. Ms. Nadolsky moved into a room at the Old Oak Ranch, a 170-acre summer camp in the Sierra foothills. She had been living out of her van the last few years, and a robbery at gunpoint last winter left her so nervous she stayed up until dawn most nights to guard against more attacks. Her arrival at the ranch, she said, was the first time in months she’d slept through the night. She stayed in one of the camp’s large rooms — what she called the “V.I.P. room” — and had meals delivered to her door. “My first night I was in shock and awe,” she said. “I felt safe for a change.” [Track coronavirus cases in California by county.] Yet just six weeks after she’d settled into her new room, she had to move out. “They told me I had to be out of there by 6 o’clock,” she said. “They just threw everything in my van. I was treated like a bag of trash again.” Project Roomkey has been championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom as an important defense against the coronavirus, as well as a step toward reducing homelessness. The state promised $150 million and FEMA pledged to reimburse local governments for most expenses related to the program. By early September, the state reported, nearly 22,000 people had been placed in temporary rooms all across California. But in Tuolumne County, which is just north of Yosemite, the early success of Project Roomkey was followed by an abrupt, chaotic unraveling that exposed an already fragile group of people to increased health risks. The stability Old Oak Ranch provided to several dozen people, including Ms. Nadolsky, vanished in a matter of hours just as a resurgence in coronavirus infections swept through California in June. Ms. Nadolsky has a rare neurological condition called dystonia, which has caused her three strokes and worsens when she is under stress. The day she was pushed to leave the ranch, she sat on the side of the road for hours, wondering where she would sleep that night while experiencing a painful dystonic episode. Project Roomkey was never intended to be permanent. The state rolled the program out quickly and counties raced to spend the newly available money. Kellae Brown, homelessness prevention coordinator of Tuolumne County, said state officials didn’t always have guidance when questions came up at the beginning. “There were literally no answers to give,” she said in late June.

Denise Cloward, the agency’s housing director, said one of the main problems was insufficient funding that had to be spent quickly.
