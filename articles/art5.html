By Jill C. Trepanier Dr. Trepanier is a climate scientist at Louisiana State University. Climate and weather science have made impressive advancements in the 15 years since Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in their ability to track these storms and identify how climate change influences their formation and ferocity. Yet the United States is still woefully unprepared. Our coastlines in many places are overbuilt and lack defenses against storm surge and flooding from heavy rains. And the response in the hours and days after these storms hit is often slow and inadequate. We can change this. To do so, politicians should turn to the scientists who study these storms and how to protect against the catastrophic damage they can inflict. Since Katrina, many scientists have focused their careers on assessing the vulnerability of the Gulf Coast and other coastlines to major hurricanes and have spent years assembling government-funded research teams of fellow university scientists, restoration management experts and university-affiliated coastal extension advisers. They have deep local and geographic expertise and understand that hurricane dangers vary across landscapes, so adequately protecting one location will not necessarily protect another. They know, for example, the greatest risk to New Orleans is typically storm surge, but that more rural areas in western Louisiana face more danger from wind extremes because their swamplands are capable of absorbing some storm surge. They know which bridges and highways are susceptible to the most serious damage and which communities could be cut off and isolated. They know where industrial waste is at risk of washing into a neighborhood or polluting groundwater.
