The result has been an international bike shortage. And the world’s largest bike maker, Giant, expects its supplies to remain tight for some time to come. After President Trump started his trade war with China in 2018, Giant moved some of its manufacturing for the American market from China to the company’s home base in Taiwan to avoid the added tariffs. The next year, the European Union imposed antidumping duties on electric bikes from China, so Giant began making those in Taiwan, too. But when the pandemic caused demand for bikes to jump, Giant needed to reverse course. With its Taiwan facility already under strain, the company had little choice but to crank up production in China, even if it meant bearing the extra cost of tariffs.
