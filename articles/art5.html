City Council Votes to Expel One of Its Own for 1st Time in Memory<br></h1><p id="artcont">Andy King, a Bronx Democrat, was voted out after facing three ethics inquiries. By Emma G. Fitzsimmons A New York City councilman once made a female staff member uncomfortable by holding her hand for too long and asking her to wear a beautiful gown to a fund-raising gala. He told another staff member, who had to go to the emergency room for menstrual bleeding, to “put a Band-Aid on it.” And he was accused of pocketing $2,000 in cash from a payout to a third staff member and refusing to pay a $15,000 fine imposed by the City Council. The councilman, Andy King, a Democrat from the Bronx, has long been accused of misbehavior, leading to three ethics investigations by the Council. He finally lost his job on Monday. The City Council voted to oust Mr. King in a stunning rebuke that was believed to be the first time in the city’s history that a Council member was expelled in a vote by colleagues. “Councilman King’s behavior is unfixable,” Corey Johnson, the Council speaker, said at a video hearing held over Zoom. The Council’s ethics committee found last week that the latest allegations against Mr. King were substantiated and recommended his expulsion. The vote was 48-2, with one of the no votes cast by Mr. King. Several Council members expressed regret that they had not removed him sooner. “I’ve heard no contrition from Councilman King at all, ever, for any of his conduct,” said Costa Constantinides, a councilman from Queens. Mr. King offered a lengthy defense during the hearing, arguing that he was targeted by investigators for political reasons and because he is a Black man. He said the Council had never expelled someone for behavior that was not a crime. “I ask us not to be the Council that does that,” Mr. King said. Mr. King filed a lawsuit against the city in federal court on Monday afternoon, claiming race discrimination and arguing that his expulsion was “arbitrary and capricious.” The Council’s decision was of “unprecedented severity in comparison to similarly situated Council members who have also not been convicted of a criminal offense,” the complaint said. Mr. King’s lawyer, Joey Jackson, said at a news conference on Friday that investigators were out to get Mr. King, ignoring what he said was a history of good deeds for his Bronx constituents. “It was always an assassination — a character assassination — against a councilman who stands up for his community,” Mr. Jackson said of the investigation. A two-thirds vote is required to expel a City Council member, something that has not happened since the City Charter was revised in 1989. Mr. Johnson’s office said it believed the expulsion was the first decided by a Council vote in the city’s history. Other members have been automatically ousted when they were convicted of criminal charges. Mr. King faced four charges in the latest Council investigation: harassment and discrimination, conflicts of interest, disorderly conduct and violating rules the Council had set for him. When a staff member told Mr. King in September 2017 that she needed to go to the emergency room for menstrual bleeding, Mr. King made the Band-Aid comment and laughed, according to a 68-page report by the ethics committee. Mr. King was also accused of giving another staff member an extra payment of $9,500 in 2019 and forcing the staff member to give him back $2,000 in cash. Mr. King also failed to pay the fine imposed by the Council last year. A special election will be scheduled to replace Mr. King. Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to schedule the special election within three days of the vacancy, and it is typically held at least 80 days later, which would fall in late December. On Monday, Mr. King offered a spirited defense against the charges, saying that he had heard the staff member say she was bleeding at a chaotic work event, but he did not see her gesture toward her genital area. He said that he was trying to negotiate how to pay the $15,000 fine, but that he felt he should get a credit for the pay he had lost during his suspension. Mr. King said he had given a few staff members a bonus — a common practice in the Council — and was traveling in the Virgin Islands when the staff member first claimed to give him the cash. “There were no kickback schemes involved at all,” Mr. King said. The Council voted 44-1 last year to suspend Mr. King for 30 days without pay and to fine him. A motion to expel him was defeated, 34-12. Investigators had found that Mr. King used Council funds to plan a retreat in the Virgin Islands that coincided with the wedding of his wife’s daughter. Mr. King refused to cooperate with the investigation and sought to thwart it by threatening and firing staff members who he believed were cooperating, the ethics committee found. In his first ethics investigation in 2018, Mr. King was ordered to undergo sensitivity and ethics training after a female staff member lodged a sexual harassment claim against him. Mr. King’s predecessor, Larry B. Seabrook, automatically lost his Council seat in 2012 when he was convicted in Federal District Court in Manhattan of orchestrating a broad corruption scheme to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars in city money to his relatives, friends and a girlfriend. Several Council members lamented the hostile work environment that Mr. King created, and his treatment of women. Ben Kallos, a councilman from Manhattan, said he wished he had voted to expel Mr. King last year. “We have a duty to believe women,” Mr. Kallos said. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
