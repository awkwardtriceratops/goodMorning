By Jim Tankersley and Nicholas Fandos WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers on Tuesday that the economy was recovering from the pandemic-induced recession but said “more work” was needed in certain areas, suggesting that the administration may be willing to agree on a stimulus package as large as $1.5 trillion. “Whether it is $1 trillion or $1.5 trillion, again, let’s not get caught on a number,” Mr. Mnuchin told the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. “Let’s move forward on a bipartisan basis now. I do not think the right outcome is zero. Nobody does.” The testimony, combined with renewed stimulus discussions among Republican lawmakers, highlighted divisions over how big of an economic package is needed as the pandemic continues to hurt businesses and keeps millions of people out of work. Mr. Mnuchin reiterated his support for at least some version of two of Democrats’ top priorities in negotiations: enhanced benefits for the unemployed and additional money for revenue-constrained state and local governments, albeit at lower levels than Democrats support. But Senate Republicans appeared to be coalescing around a scaled-back stimulus plan that they could vote on as soon as next week but will not win Democrat support. With a price tag of $500 billion to $700 billion, the Senate proposal would reinstate lapsed federal unemployment benefits at $300 per week — half their previous level — and allocate $105 billion for schools and funds for testing and the Postal Service, according to Republican aides familiar with the discussions. It would also grant new liability protections to employers. But rather than moving closer to what Democrats or the White House have signaled they want, the proposal is a step backward. The administration indicated support for a $1 trillion package floated by Senate Republican leadership, while Democrats have most recently pressed for at least $2.2 trillion. Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, told reporters on Tuesday that party leaders had set a goal of beginning debate on the measure next week, when lawmakers return from summer recess, and senior party aides said they expected all but one or two Republican senators to support it. “We have a focused, targeted solution that we hope that the House would pass,” Mr. Barrasso said. There is little chance of that happening. Democrats, who control the House, pushed a $3.4 trillion stimulus measure through that chamber in May, including an extension of the full $600 weekly federal jobless payment. They have since been willing to cut down the cost, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California saying last week that she would accept $2.2 trillion. Mr. Mnuchin’s comments on Tuesday appeared to up the White House ante on how much it would accept, but it still falls short of what Democrats have embraced. Mr. Mnuchin said on Tuesday that lawmakers should not worry about the “top line” amount and instead quickly address the areas that need help. “We need support quickly, and if we need to do more we can come back,” Mr. Mnuchin said.
