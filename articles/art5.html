To the Editor: Re “New York’s School Chaos Is Breaking Me,” by Michelle Goldberg (column, Aug. 25): New York’s school chaos is breaking us, too. I’m a high school librarian at an overcrowded school in Queens. My husband is a middle school math teacher in the Bronx. We have a kindergartner who will be attending class in person on Fridays only, but sometimes on a Monday or a Tuesday as well, and a 7-month-old. We interviewed a nanny but told her we have no idea what the daily hours would look like or what the school calendar is. There is still no information about the mythical child care centers that will be opening. There likely won’t be one in our neighborhood, or one with the hours we need. Plus, who is working there, and will there be personal protective equipment and an updated HVAC system there? Teachers can opt to work remotely only if they have a health issue. We are being told to head back to school buildings to support working parents, but now we are in a child care bind. Teachers are being asked to save the city’s children, but who is saving ours?
