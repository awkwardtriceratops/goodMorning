By Noam Scheiber For years, the Labor Department has made a practice of issuing sternly worded news releases calling out companies deemed by its enforcement staff to have violated the law, including rules governing discrimination, worker safety, the minimum wage and overtime. But the department’s appetite for using that spotlight appears to have waned. In a Sept. 24 memo, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, Deputy Secretary Patrick Pizzella instructed the heads of the department’s enforcement agencies that “absent extraordinary circumstances,” the findings of their agencies “generally should not be the basis” for news releases. Mr. Pizzella argued that such releases tend to linger prominently in search results about companies and can prove misleading if a citation or other enforcement action “is ultimately found to be unjustified.” He instructed officials responsible for enforcing labor and employment laws to generally refrain from issuing releases until after a matter has reached its conclusion — for example, once a court has issued a judgment or an employer has reached a settlement with the department. Citations are often issued at roughly the same point in the enforcement process that a prosecutor would bring an indictment in a criminal matter. The memo may be having some effect already. Since its flurry of releases about citations in mid-September, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has not issued discrete news releases about particular companies for Covid-related violations, instead providing a weekly summary of proposed penalties with a table listing up to three dozen companies that have recently been cited. The summaries include little detail about what violations the companies may have committed and no comments from department officials. News of the memo alarmed some experts in workplace regulation, who see publicizing violations as one of the most cost-effective tools the department has for ensuring compliance with regulations, such as those enforced by OSHA. “OSHA is a tiny agency, and if it doesn’t amplify the impact of its inspections it will have very little effect on almost every workplace in the United States,” said David Michaels, an epidemiologist who headed the agency under President Barack Obama. “The basis of every inspection is to increase deterrence.” A Labor Department spokeswoman said, “The departmental memo is part of an effort to take a more thoughtful and deliberative approach that informs the public about bad actors while allowing accused labor unions and employers the opportunity to defend themselves.” She added that the recent, consolidated announcements of Covid-related violations were a response to the rising number of such citations — “to make it easier for the public to see all of the establishments.” Dr. Michaels, who now teaches at the George Washington University School of Public Health, is credited for increasing the practice of issuing news releases when he was at the department. In 2009, he helped make it OSHA policy to put out a news release in any case where the agency had proposed a fine of roughly $40,000 or more. At the time, Dr. Michaels said the purpose was to discourage other employers from running afoul of OSHA rules. Borrowing from an academic literature on the subject, he called the approach “regulation by shaming.” An article by the Duke University economist Matthew S. Johnson, published this year in The American Economic Review, concluded that the policy had largely achieved its goals. Mr. Johnson found that an OSHA news release led to a more than 70 percent reduction in violations at facilities in the same sector within roughly three miles of the company cited, and a 30 percent reduction in violations at facilities within 30 miles. According to Mr. Johnson’s analysis, the releases created negative publicity in the local press, mobilizing workers at other companies to increase pressure on employers. To have the same impact as a single news release through inspections alone, Mr. Johnson estimated, OSHA would need to perform more than 200 additional safety inspections.
