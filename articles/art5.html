Schools, Biden Transition, Ina Garten: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing<br></h1><p id="artcont">Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day. By Remy Tumin and Jeremiah M. Bogert, Jr. (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. More cities and states act against the pandemic. Rising positivity rates prompted New York City to return its vast public school system to all-remote learning, perhaps the most significant setback since the spring, when the city was a global coronavirus epicenter. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said the nation needed “a uniform approach,” instead of a “disjointed” state-by-state, city-by-city response. But so far, that’s what the country has. New today: Ohio announced a nightly curfew, and Mississippi extended a mask mandate to seven more counties. Maryland will order all bars, restaurants and night clubs to close by 10 p.m. Los Angeles will put in effect similar restrictions. And Pennsylvania will require anyone who enters the state to be tested before arrival. Gov. Kim Reynolds issued Iowa’s first statewide mask order as the state faces a spiraling hospital crisis. She joins a wave of Republican governors who are reversing course. A quarter of a million Americans have died from the coronavirus, passing the number Dr. Fauci predicted in March, with no sure end in sight. 2. The virus is overwhelming hospitals and killing more than 1,100 Americans a day. Above, Madison, Wis. That out-of-control surge is actually helping scientists measure more quickly how well their vaccines protect against the coronavirus, enabling the drugmakers Pfizer and Moderna to accelerate trials. Trials of treatments may also speed up. Pfizer said that complete results from its late-stage vaccine trials showed its vaccine to be 95 percent effective, with no serious side effects. On Monday, Moderna said that early analysis had found its vaccine to be 94.5 percent effective. Separately, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the first completely at-home rapid coronavirus test, which can return results in about half an hour. It is projected to cost $50 or less. 3. President-elect Joe Biden is pressuring the Trump administration to authorize the presidential transition. “We’re all ready to go and do an awful lot of work right now,” Mr. Biden said on a call with emergency medical workers to the coronavirus, objecting to delays caused by President Trump’s refusal to acknowledge his victory and the refusal of Emily Murphy, the administrator of the General Services Administration, to sign paperwork giving his team access to funds, equipment and government data. He did note that he plans to work with state and local leaders on mask mandates. In other Democratic news, the party’s House caucus nominated Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 80, as their leader for another term. She suggested it could be her last. 4. Republicans in Michigan face accusations of racism after blocking certification of the election over slight discrepancies in majority-Black precincts while ignoring similar problems in heavily white areas. An outcry forced them to reverse themselves. Around the country, President Trump and his allies have been accused of playing into ugly racist stereotypes by casting doubt on Black voters in their last-ditch effort to overturn the election. Georgia’s county-by-county hand recount of roughly five million ballots in the presidential race is expected to be completed by tonight’s midnight deadline. President-elect Joe Biden is up by over 12,000 votes. 5. Boeing’s 737 Max will fly again. Twenty months after the jet was grounded around the world, the Federal Aviation Administration said changes in software, design and training had made the plane safe to operate., The two fatal crashes that prompted the grounding, in Indonesia and Ethiopia, killed 346 people, and investigations faulted Boeing software and a host of company and U.S. regulatory failures. Relatives of victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash questioned whether Boeing had done enough to address safety concerns. It will be weeks, if not months, before American, United and Southwest can get pilots retrained and the altered plane back into service — and reassure travelers about its safety. Other countries’ aviation authorities will have to issue similar rulings before it can operate elsewhere. Here’s what travelers need to know. 6. A federal judge blocked President Trump’s policy of turning away unaccompanied migrant children at the border as public health risks. Since March, the Trump administration has used an emergency decree to effectively seal the border to migrants, citing the potential spread of the coronavirus in detention facilities. But the judge ruled that the expulsion of thousands of children without due process exceeded the authority that public health emergency decrees confer. It is unclear if the Trump administration will appeal. In other administration news, an elite force of Somali commandos the U.S. has trained to fight the Qaeda-linked terror group Al Shabab could fall apart if Mr. Trump withdraws American troops from Somalia. Mr. Trump plans to pull many troops from Afghanistan and Iraq as well. 7. Kim Ng has been ready to be a general manager for years. The pioneering baseball executive, 52, proved herself over and over for three decades. Now, tapped to be the Miami Marlins’ new general manager by Derek Jeter, the team’s chief executive and part owner, she has become the first woman to hold the role in any major men’s leagues in North America. Several of her peers say they can’t think of anyone more qualified for the job. Her mother was more blunt: “Show them boys how it’s done.” In other sports news, tonight is the first round of the N.B.A. draft. The Minnesota Timberwolves spent months watching films, traveling the country and conducting interviews on video to prepare for making the first pick — or trading it away. 8. Ina Garten’s Hamptons quarantine is not our quarantine. Her fabulous kitchen is not our kitchen. But this year, her Thanksgiving is pretty much our Thanksgiving: tiny and improvised.
