Then the $600 Checks Stopped.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Anonymized bank data shows what happened next, as balances shrank and hopes dimmed for action from Washington. By Emily Badger and Quoctrung Bui The $600 weekly unemployment benefit the federal government funded this year was a remarkably effective expansion of the safety net. It helped pay many workers more than their lost wages. It enabled families to spend more than during normal times. It even allowed households to put away savings as the economy was teetering. Then the money stopped at the end of July. And it’s clear, looking back, what happened next: Workers quickly burned through the reserves that the aid had given them. Of the savings many households were able to build up over the course of four months of unusually generous government help, much of it was gone by the end of August. $600 weekly supplement expires Change in Median Checking Account Balance From January +120% +100% Unemployed who  received U.I. benefits 74% decline In May, these workers had twice as much money in their checking accounts as they did in January.   +80% +60% Employed +40% +20% January February March April May
