Save Your Life?<br></h1><p id="artcont">Supported by Scientists are looking at the medicinal potential of plants and animals in the region’s vast tropical forests. By Mark J. Plotkin Dr. Plotkin is an ethnobotanist who has spent more than three decades working in the Amazon. Western medicine is the most successful system of healing ever devised and is becoming more so as technology improves and synthetic medicines proliferate. But Mother Nature has been synthesizing weird and wonderful medicinal chemicals for over three billion years, many of which chemists could not predict or devise in their wildest dreams. They should go to the Amazon. Over more than three decades, I’ve worked, collaborated and lived with the forest’s shamans as I learned some of their secrets. In the dreamscape of Amazonia flourishes an abundance of astounding species of plants and animals that have provided society with a pharmacopoeia of medicines of astonishing range, from contraceptives to treatments for high blood pressure and malaria, a dental analgesic and surgical muscle relaxants and chemicals that expand the mind. The region is so vast and impenetrable that much within it remains undiscovered. No wonder the richness of the landscape and the impressive medicinal knowledge of the Indigenous peoples inspired bewilderment and wonder in early visitors from Europe. As early as the 1600s, the Dutch physician Willem Piso observed several “very effective” local treatments in Brazil, writing, “These Indigenous people, in spite of their total lack of scientific training, have passed on many noble, secret antidotes and medicines unknown to classic science to the next generation.” Today the region’s magnificent forests are being destroyed and its Indigenous cultures disrupted and extinguished ever more rapidly. But the medicinal potential of Amazonia is actually rising, because new technology allows us to find, isolate, evaluate, manipulate and employ natural products faster than ever. If we can outrun the destruction, we will not have to choose between the microchip or the medicine man. Both can lead us to new cures, if approached in a responsible and ethical manner. Our ignorance about Amazonian flora and fauna remains staggering. A recent study estimates there are about 16,000 species of trees in Amazonia, of which several thousand have not even been named by scientists, much less evaluated for medicinal potential. Scientists cannot even agree on how many species of plants and animals and fungi inhabit the South American rainforest. We are collecting new species almost faster than we can identify them: In late July, a panel estimated that we find a novel species in Amazonia every other day. These discoveries are not merely tiny fungi and insects. In just the past few years, researchers have discovered such seemingly obvious creatures as a new species of river dolphin, two novel species of electric eels, a cobalt blue tarantula and the loftiest tree in Amazonia, which is almost 100 feet taller than the previous record-holder. In a world where records are typically broken by seconds or inches, this latter find clearly demonstrates how much remains to be learned. Wonders abound. One is the green monkey frog. Laboratory analysis of its skin has yielded several new proteins, two of which have been investigated as potential means of increasing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, an important physiological challenge for delivering medicine directly to the brain — one of the holy grails of modern medicine. Two other novel groups of proteins found in the same frog are antimicrobial, which might help fortify our arsenal of antibiotics; bacteria resistance to commonly used ones is a serious and growing problem in American hospitals. Most striking was the isolation from the frog of a new opioid, dermorphin, which is 40 times more potent than morphine.
