By Jim Rutenberg, Alan Feuer, Nick Corasaniti and Reid J. Epstein With Joseph R. Biden Jr. edging closer to victory in the presidential race, President Trump and the Republican Party have been intensifying efforts to halt the counting of ballots and to challenge the ballots of Democratic voters in lawsuits across the country. Nearly a dozen suits were already making their way through the courts in Nevada, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia, four key states where Mr. Biden leads or has won the vote count. But none of them appear — at least not yet — to provide Mr. Trump what he would need to prevail: the rejection of enough Democratic ballots in enough states to reverse any Biden victory. If Mr. Trump and the Republicans cannot find those rejections through the courts, they could — and will — try to do so through recounts, but the bar is high there too.
