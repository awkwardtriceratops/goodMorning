<br></h1><p id="artcont">While you’ve been binge-watching Netflix and peering anxiously at your sourdough, John Hatleberg has been working on replicas of the Hope Diamond and its earlier incarnations for the Smithsonian. By Geraldine Fabrikant In the midst of the pandemic, diamonds (at least newly mined ones) may have lost their luster. But in the studio of his New York apartment, John Hatleberg is betting it will soon be back. For months, he has been at work hunched over a gem-faceting machine, where he is cutting and polishing a synthetic material that will be used to make an exact replica of the Hope Diamond as it existed in the 17th century. Perhaps no diamond has as much glamour as this luminous blue 45.52-carat stone, encircled by 16 white diamonds and set on display in the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History (temporarily closed, but its treasure twinkles 24-7 online). Heavy in mystique as well as weight, it is replete with a history of a royal owner, theft and family curses and has long been the most popular object at the Smithsonian, where about four million visitors a year used to come gape at it. But the current Hope diamond is only the latest version of the stone. The diamond, first bought from a mine in India, was recut as the “French Blue” after King Louis XIV acquired it. Stolen during the French Revolution, it resurfaced in 1812 in London and was recut into its current style and named for its owner, Henry Philip Hope. Having completed replicas of the original stone and the Hope itself, Mr. Hatleberg has been laboring since the winter to finish the “French Blue.” He strives to assure that his replicas have the exact same angles and color as their inspiration, a process that involved seven trips to Azotic LLC., a laboratory for gems and crystals in Rochester, Minn. There, experts coated and recoated the replica using a thick level of precious metals to match the lush blue of the Hope. Mr. Hatleberg is not working for some wealthy private client who wants a knockoff for travel. Instead his three replicas will appear next to the Hope at the Smithsonian. When? Who knows? The art of replicating diamonds is a delicate one, and perhaps no one has worked directly with so many named stones as Mr. Hatleberg, 63, who made a replica of the 31.06-carat Wittelsbach-Graff diamond for Laurence Graff, the billionaire diamond dealer, and the 273.85-carat Centenary diamond that was discovered in 1986 by DeBeers, the giant diamond company. So perfect was his copy of the Centenary that when a group of DeBeers executives were invited to compare the two, “some could not immediately tell the difference,” said Rory More O’Ferrall, the manager of marketing liaison at the time. For the Okavango Diamond Company, Mr. Hatleberg recently completed a copy of the Okavango Blue, a 20.46-carat fancy deep blue diamond found in 2018 in Botswana. “We wanted a replica because we need to hold on the legacy of the stone for future generations.” said Marcus ter Haar, the managing director of the Okavango Diamond Company, which is selling the original, in a telephone interview. A perfect replica is an art form that, for Mr. Hatleberg, can require months and even years of work. Though the Smithsonian has seen many replicas of the diamond, “we have had the luxury of looking at people doing that kind of work, but John is an artist with a sense of detail and perfection,” said Jeffrey Post, the curator of the U.S. National Gem and Mineral Collection at the Smithsonian who hired him. “When John hands me a stone, I know he has thought about and analyzed it, and he would not hand it to me unless he thought it was perfect.”
