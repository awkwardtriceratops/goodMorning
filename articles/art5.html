By Shane Goldmacher The confetti now comes in a bottle. The Democrats’ biggest donors are used to being feted at the party’s national convention, breezing through a maze of tiered luxury suites and V.I.P. rooms with free-flowing appetizers, access and booze. This year, though, even those who have given $500,000 and up are stuck watching the same virtual event from home as the rest of us. So ahead of the week’s virtual gathering, the party and the Biden campaign mailed along a care package to tide over any forlorn financiers: notebooks embossed with the number 46 (as in the potential for Joseph R. Biden Jr. to be the 46th president), hats, buttons, posters, a bag of “Cup of Joe” coffee (a moderate, friendly medium roast) and a bottle of confetti to be deployed whenever the mood strikes. “I haven’t quite figured that out yet,” said Joseph Falk, a Democratic donor and fund-raiser based in Florida. “I presume I’ll open it on Thursday? Or maybe with Kamala Harris.” Some donors have been posting pictures of their swag kits, arranging the items just so to have the perfect Instagram or Facebook shot. The Biden team ensured the package had daily credentials for display, even though there are no security lines to be bypassed. The passes include, in all caps, the words “DELAWARE SUITE,” even though no such thing exists virtually. As far as political flexes go, it’s no selfie with a senator. But for 2020, it will have to suffice. “In the age of social media, credential pics still have some currency,” said Nu Wexler, a Democratic communications consultant who has been to the last six Democratic conventions. Like nearly everything else in American life, the coronavirus pandemic has upended the already cloistered world of political fund-raising, as campaigns and contributors alike figure out how to raise tens of millions of dollars without so much as a photo line (Zoom screenshots are a poor substitute). “There is nothing like the excitement of being in the convention hall and the daily nonstop of events, meetings and ad hoc hotel lobby meetups,” said Michael Kempner, a Democratic fund-raiser who has previously raised money for both Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris, the Democratic nominee for vice president. “I am surprised how much I already miss it.” Tom Kemp, a tech entrepreneur in California, gave the Biden Victory Fund $100,000 in June, in what he called a bid to save democracy. He’s never been to a convention before. “If I could have just had nosebleed seats, I would have been excited,” Mr. Kemp said. “It would have been a nice cherry on top.” Before the virus canceled the in-person convention, a group of donors affiliated with American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC, had reserved a prime luxury suite at the original Milwaukee convention site. The group later received a refund from the host committee of more than $500,000, according to people familiar with the matter. Now American Bridge, which had a reputation among donors for hosting some particularly blowout bashes in the past, has arranged for nightly preconvention virtual sessions, including one on Thursday with Chris Dodd, the former senator who headed Mr. Biden’s vice-presidential search committee. The rare hot ticket for this virtual convention is for Tuesday evening, as donors to American Bridge will get a private session with Mary L. Trump, the president’s estranged niece, who wrote a recent tell-all book on President Trump. She’ll be taking questions with Tony Schwartz, the ghost writer for Mr. Trump’s “The Art of the Deal,” who has since become critical of the president. “We’re always looking for creative ways to engage with our supporters, keep them fired up, and get the word out about the work we’re doing,” said Bradley Beychok, the president of American Bridge. Still, it’s not the same as the serendipity of being there. Mr. Falk said that “one of the biggest joys” of conventions was chance run-ins with candidates and rising political stars at the convention site or in hotel lobbies — none of which are so easily recreated online. “How am I going to do that unofficially at the bar?” he said. It’s not like top donors are getting no access. Some politicians are offering themselves up via Zoom or other virtual platforms. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, who had been vetted by the Biden team as a contender for the vice presidency, held an event for donors on Monday before her speech. “Appreciate how much you’ve done to help get us here,” said an invitation from one of her fund-raisers. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and a former candidate for president, will hold an “investors circle reunion” on Wednesday, before he speaks the next day (suggested donation $500, though any member of his presidential finance committee is invited). The Biden campaign has offered some password-protected private briefings for top donors, including with Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, the campaign manager, and Steve Ricchetti, the campaign chairman, who gave a presentation on Monday. There is also exclusive “special after hours” programming for after the speeches end.
