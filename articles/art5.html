By Greg Bensinger Mr. Bensinger is a member of the editorial board. The Justice Department took a big swing at Google this week, alleging in a lawsuit that it violated antitrust law by stifling competition, particularly with its search engine and lucrative advertising business. It’s a compelling case, positioning Google as an anticompetitive behemoth that suppresses would-be rivals through exclusive deals and runs up prices for marketers through its byzantine online advertising sales process. Consumers, the Justice Department contends, are suffering from a lack of choice when they search for travel deals, local restaurants and answers to everyday questions. It would be great to see competitors like DuckDuckGo given a fighting chance to challenge Google’s clear market dominance, but the case here is both too narrow and too long coming to dethrone the company. The Justice Department appears to have rushed the suit in a quixotic attempt to make it an Election Day issue, and it is outgunned by Google’s legion of attorneys and mountain of cash.

There’s no question about Google’s dominance: It commands as much as 90 percent of the search market, and nearly 75 percent of mobile phones use its Android software. “The Google of today is a monopoly gatekeeper of the internet,” the Justice Department wrote in its suit. “For the sake of American consumers, advertisers and all companies now reliant on the internet economy, the time has come to stop Google’s anticompetitive conduct and restore competition.” But American consumers shouldn’t hold their breath. The case will most likely drag on for years while appeals are heard, meaning Google can continue operating largely as it does today. Justice Department lawyers will have to convince federal judges of the central allegation in the lawsuit: that Google’s contracts paying Apple and other smartphone manufacturers to make it the default search engine and operating system on those phones are anticompetitive, rather than just savvy deal making. Google will explain that its market share is a function of consumer choice and not manipulation. The government will also need to make plain the overly complicated online advertising market and demonstrate how Google’s control forces marketers to pay higher fees, resulting in higher prices for consumer products. It takes some mental gymnastics to connect the price of a can of Coca-Cola to the complex and opaque automated bidding wars for an ad slot atop a Google search for “soda.” The coming weeks are likely to bring a cascade of suits from state attorneys general who have also investigated Google and will contend it hurts consumers by crowding out competitors. Eleven states joined the Justice Department’s action.
