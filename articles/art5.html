Then She Woke Up at a Funeral Home.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Timesha Beauchamp, 20, was taken to the funeral home in a body bag. When she arrived, a worker discovered her breathing with her eyes open. By Allyson Waller and Derrick Bryson Taylor A Michigan woman who was declared dead by paramedics on Sunday was discovered alive hours later by a funeral home worker who was preparing to embalm her body, a lawyer for her family said. The lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, said the woman, Timesha Beauchamp, was born with cerebral palsy. “She requires constant care since birth,” he said Tuesday. “I believe her relative fragile condition contributed to the false belief by the authorities” that she had died.
