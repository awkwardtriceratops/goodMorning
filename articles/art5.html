He is facing life in prison. By Nicole Hong Her voice trembling, the witness, identified only as Camila, recalled on Tuesday the precise date that she was sexually abused by Keith Raniere, the leader of a self-improvement company called Nxivm that prosecutors described as a sex cult. It was Sept. 18, 2005, she said in her victim statement. She was 15, and he was 46. He insisted, she said, that they both recognize the date as their anniversary. The relationship lasted 12 years, Camila said, with Mr. Raniere repeatedly summoning her, sexually abusing her and taking nude pictures of her. She said she attempted suicide once. “He wanted me to believe that my only value came from how he felt about me,” said Camila, who was the first victim speak at Mr. Raniere’s sentencing hearing. “It has taken a long time to process the trauma he caused.” Mr. Raniere had promised a path to happiness, seducing successful and wealthy people including those who felt they lacked a higher purpose in life. His company offered self-empowerment workshops that were taken by Hollywood celebrities and business leaders. But underneath the surface, Mr. Raniere was a puppet master controlling a cultlike criminal enterprise, prosecutors revealed at his trial last year. Some women in Nxivm were forced to have sex with Mr. Raniere, and even branded with his initials in a secret ceremony. Now, Mr. Raniere, 60, is being sentenced in federal court in Brooklyn for his participation in sex trafficking and other crimes. His conviction last year capped a stunning downfall for a man who was once idolized by his followers, but has since been exposed as a fraudster who exploited Nxivm’s adherents for money, sex and power. Former Nxivm members said Mr. Raniere and his inner circle preyed on insecure people who hoped that immersing themselves in expensive self-help classes would unlock the key to fulfillment. Even highly educated people became trapped inside Mr. Raniere’s system, which he sold as the only way to overcome their fears, shaming anyone who tried to quit. At Mr. Raniere’s trial, prosecutors lifted the veil on a sordid side to Nxivm (pronounced NEX-ee-um). A primary focus was a secretive women-only group inside the organization. During a videotaped initiation ceremony, the women laid naked on a table, saying, “Master, please brand me,” as a cauterizing pen seared their skin without anesthesia.
