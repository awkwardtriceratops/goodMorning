Mexico’s Defense Chief, U.S. Says<br></h1><p id="artcont">Drug enforcement agents had long tried to solve the mystery of “El Padrino,” a shadowy, powerful force. They’ve now identified him as Salvador Cienfuegos, Mexico’s defense chief from 2012 to 2018. By Azam Ahmed and Alan Feuer MEXICO CITY — American law enforcement agents were listening in as Mexican cartel members chattered on a wiretap, talking about a powerful, shadowy figure known as El Padrino, or The Godfather. Agents had been closing in on him for months, suspecting that this central figure in the drug trade was a high-ranking official in the Mexican military. All of a sudden, one of the people under surveillance told his fellow cartel members that El Padrino happened to be on television at that very moment. The agents quickly checked to see who it was — and found it was the Mexican secretary of defense, Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos, according to four American officials involved in the investigation. In that moment, the authorities say, they finally confirmed that the mystery patron of one of the nation’s most violent drug cartels was actually the leader in charge of waging Mexico’s war against organized crime. It was a stunning display of how deep the tendrils of organized crime run in Mexico, and on Thursday night General Cienfuegos was taken into custody by the American authorities at the Los Angeles airport while traveling with his family. Even for Mexico, a country often inured to the unrelenting violence and corruption that have gripped it for years, the arrest was nothing less than extraordinary, piercing the veil of invincibility that the nation’s armed forces have long enjoyed. Mr. Cienfuegos, Mexico’s defense minister from 2012 to 2018, is being charged with laundering money and trafficking heroin, cocaine, methamphetamines and marijuana from late 2015 through early 2017, according to an indictment unsealed in the Eastern District of New York on Friday. The charges are the result of a multi-year sting that investigators called Operation Padrino. Officials say that General Cienfuegos helped the H-2 cartel, a criminal group that committed horrific acts of violence as part of its drug smuggling business, with its maritime shipments. In exchange for lucrative payouts, officials say, General Cienfuegos also directed military operations away from the cartel and toward its rivals.
