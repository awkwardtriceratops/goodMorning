By Thomas Fuller and Derrick Bryson Taylor MORAGA, Calif. — President Trump reversed himself on Friday, approving a package of wildfire disaster relief for California hours after officials from his administration had explained why the state should not receive the aid. The abrupt turnaround came after the president spoke with Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and Representative Kevin McCarthy, a Republican and the House minority leader, with the White House saying the men “presented a convincing case” for the state receiving the aid. The disaster relief aid covers six major wildfires that scorched more than 1.8 million acres, destroyed thousands of structures and caused at least three deaths last month. “Just got off the phone with President Trump who has approved our Major Disaster Declaration request,” Mr. Newsom of California said in a statement. “Grateful for his quick response.” [Want to get our daily newsletter California Today by email?

California has suffered a series of huge fires since August, when freak lightning storms ignited hundreds of blazes, some of which grew to be the largest in modern state history. Subsequent fires in September tore through parts of the Sierra Nevada and wine country north of San Francisco. Earlier on Friday, Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, referred to the Federal Emergency Management Agency when he said aid for the September fires “was not supported by the relevant data that states must provide for approval and the president concurred with the FEMA administrator’s recommendation.” Lizzie Litzow, the agency’s press secretary, said damage assessments of some of the fires that started in early September, which included one of the largest fires in California’s history, “were not of such severity and magnitude to exceed the combined capabilities of the state, affected local governments, voluntary agencies and other responding federal agencies.” The initial rejection was unusual but not unprecedented: A 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service found that from 1974 to 2016 presidents denied requests for disaster relief an average of 2.9 times per year during nonelection years, and 2.1 times in a year with a presidential election. Since the enactment in 1953 of a federal disaster relief act, presidents have been authorized to issue declarations that provide states with federal assistance in response to natural and man-made incidents. The requests are judged based on criteria that take into account damage to infrastructure, existing insurance coverage and a state’s population, among others. But the president ultimately has the authority to approve or reject a disaster aid request regardless whether the criteria are met. Mr. Newsom said on Friday morning that he would appeal the denial — and had apparent success in persuading the president during their afternoon phone call. Mr. Trump’s reversal on the aid came after members of his party in California urged him to change his mind. “I am writing to respectfully request your reconsideration,” State Senator Andreas Borgeas, a Republican, wrote Mr. Trump in a letter on Friday. The Creek Fire, which ravaged parts of Mr. Borgeas’s district, “caused unprecedented damage during these most unprecedented times,” he said.
