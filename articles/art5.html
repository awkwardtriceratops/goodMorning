By Jesse McKinley and Luis Ferré-Sadurní ALBANY, N.Y. — On Sunday afternoon, faced with a new wave of infections in his virus-battered city, Mayor Bill de Blasio made a sobering decision to ask the state to roll back openings of businesses in virus hot spots in Brooklyn and Queens, pending approval from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. But on Monday, Mr. Cuomo, Mr. de Blasio’s longtime foil, refused to give it. Mr. Cuomo said he would not yet allow the city to close the nonessential businesses, suggesting that the ZIP codes that were being used to identify hot spots were too imprecise to guide shutdowns, and that he was considering other geographic boundaries. The more pressing problem, he said, lay in schools and houses of worship, including many that cater to Orthodox Jews, rather than businesses that “are not large spreaders.” The conflicting messages from the state’s two most prominent politicians created confusion for residents, business owners and parents in the affected areas and drew scrutiny to the conflict between the city and state over how to tackle early signs of a second wave of the virus in its one-time epicenter. The governor’s announcement also seemed to be yet another manifestation of the tense and often dissonant relationship between City Hall and Albany, which has an outsize role in many city decisions. Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, has frequently second-guessed or overruled the mayor, who is also a Democrat, during their overlapping tenures. Those clashes were cast in sharp relief during the early days of the pandemic, with the city and state at odds over the timing of shutting down the city businesses and its schools, among other issues. On Monday, that disconnect continued, as Mr. Cuomo accelerated the mayor’s plan to close schools in newly hard-hit areas, moving the closure date up a day to Tuesday, a decision the governor defended by saying that testing was insufficient to protect children in those schools. “I’ll never let a New Yorker send a child to a school that I wouldn’t send my child to,” he said. The governor also announced that the state would take over supervision of enforcement of mask and social-distancing rules in the hot spot clusters. “Local government will need to provide us with personnel,” he said. The mixed messages continued, even after the governor’s decision, which he said was made in consultation with the mayor, as well as the head of the city’s teachers’ union and several other city officials. Indeed, shortly after the governor spoke, Mr. de Blasio reiterated that he believed the city would still plan on closing nonessential businesses on Wednesday. “Until there is a different plan, we are preparing to implement this plan,” the mayor said, while acknowledging that the city would ultimately back off from executing the shutdown if the state didn’t authorize it.
