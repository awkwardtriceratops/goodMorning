How the CIA Directors Shape History and the Future
By Chris Whipple In the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency, there is an inscription on a wall near the entrance: And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make ye free. The line, borrowed from the New Testament, serves as a sort of C.I.A. motto — an instruction, at least according to the interpretation of one longtime agency official, to speak “truth to power.” It’s fair to wonder how a veteran of the mightiest intelligence outfit in the history of the world — one that has helped topple governments and bring down empires, that surveils both heads of state and ordinary citizens, that operates a fleet of drones to track and kill targets hiding out thousands of miles away — can think of himself as contending with power rather than embodying it. But it reflects a sensibility that runs through “The Spymasters,” Chris Whipple’s genial, engaging portrait of the men and one woman who have run the C.I.A. over the past six decades. Whipple’s spymasters come across as more beleaguered than omnipotent, stumbling more often than swaggering (to use a word favored by the former director Mike Pompeo). Their job, Whipple asserts, is “one of the hardest, and most perilous, in government.” More than one director has been sent to run the agency on the malicious assumption that the experience would doom any future political prospects. And that was all true before the inauguration of a president who rails against “the deep state” and has likened intelligence officials to Nazis. C.I.A. directors have played a major role in the decisive struggles of American foreign policy, from the Cold War to the war on terrorism to today’s competition with China. But Whipple’s animating interest lies in struggles closer to home — especially the rapport, or lack thereof, between the C.I.A. chief and the commander in chief. “The C.I.A. has one protector and one customer, and if you can’t get that relationship right then the agency is screwed,” the former director Bob Gates tells Whipple, the author of a book about White House chiefs of staff. The relationship has gone wrong as often as not. “We can overthrow foreign governments,” a senior agency official observes, “but we have a more difficult time dealing with our own.” Over and over, we see Whipple’s spymasters left hapless and humiliated by Beltway politics and bureaucratic maneuvering. They may be able to listen in on the private deliberations of world leaders, but that doesn’t mean they know when there’s a meeting at the White House to which they’re not invited. Jimmy Carter’s C.I.A. director, Stansfield Turner, was an admiral, a Rhodes scholar, even a college buddy of the president. Yet when Turner complained after discovering that there was a regular 6:30 a.m. White House “intelligence briefing” that did not include him, West Wing staffers simply changed the name to “national security briefing” and continued excluding him. The anxiety of exclusion — how can they speak truth to power if they’re not invited to the meeting? — can push directors toward a related risk: Isn’t it worth massaging truth, just a bit, to make it more palatable to power if that means staying relevant? So goes the slippery slope to “politicization” that most have found themselves on at one point or another. One of Whipple’s more damning depictions is of George Tenet, the director during the run-up to the Iraq war, and of his notorious “slam dunk” line regarding the intelligence on Saddam Hussein’s supposed weapons of mass destruction. It remains a matter of debate whether the error was the result of politicization or of sincere, if equally damaging, misjudgment. At any rate, Tenet “didn’t always challenge the administration’s lies,” Whipple writes mildly. (Other assessments have been harsher.) Yet Tenet was hardly the first C.I.A. director to grapple with such tensions and slink into such compromises. During the Vietnam War, Richard Helms grew more and more skeptical about the prospects of American success even as President Lyndon Johnson grew more and more desperate for good news. Caught between his own pessimism and his boss’s hectoring, Helms “just slacked off on providing information on Vietnam,” one of his staffers tells Whipple. Covert action has offered another means of ensuring relevance. The C.I.A. has always had a dual mission, using secret tools both to understand the world (recruiting spies, assessing intelligence) and to change it. Directors have balanced these sometimes opposing endeavors in different ways. But for policymakers outside of the intelligence community, covert action holds a unique and often irresistible allure. As Gates explains it: “The State Department would recommend the use of military force. The Defense Department would recommend diplomacy. And when they couldn’t agree, everyone would decide, ‘Let C.I.A. do a covert action.’” For ambitious directors, the “myth of covert action as a panacea” presents an opportunity. By taking up Ronald Reagan’s charge “to fight Communism around the world,” for example, William Casey became, by Whipple’s estimation, one of the most powerful leaders in the history of the agency, spearheading operations everywhere from Poland and Lebanon to Angola and Chad. Casey got regular one-on-one meetings in the Oval Office. The aftermath of 9/11 saw another surge in covert operations. The C.I.A. took a leading role in toppling the Taliban and hunting, interrogating and killing terrorists, especially as the use of drones expanded. “The C.I.A. was no longer just a gatherer of intelligence,” Whipple writes, neglecting plenty of other such departures. “It was becoming a killing machine.” (One notable exception to Whipple’s Washington focus is a richly textured account of the operation targeting the Hezbollah leader Imad Mughniyah.) Some of Whipple’s interlocutors complain that the embrace of this role as “a paramilitary army” came “at the expense of the agency’s core mission, intelligence-gathering.” For policymakers, the lure of the covert lies in the promise of power without publicity, of risks that can be more easily wished away because they are classified. But even the most “successful” instances of its use across the history that Whipple covers have had at best mixed effects over time. Was C.I.A. support of the mujahedeen fighting Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s “the most successful covert operation in history,” as Whipple puts it, or the start of a series of events that would lead to a huge terrorist attack on United States soil and a historic foreign policy blunder? Have drone strikes kept Americans safe or created dangerous blowback? Defenders can always resort to scary counterfactuals. “Without this program, Heathrow Airport would have been bombed,” Tenet says in defense of the post-9/11 “enhanced interrogation program,” taking issue with other assessments that have concluded otherwise. Whipple throws up his hands: “It’s impossible to know.” In weighing success and failure, Whipple offers measured, sympathetic, on-the-one-hand-on-the-other-hand tallies of the merits and demerits for each of his spymasters. Framing these, however, is a quotation from one intelligence official that Whipple occasionally returns to: “There are only policy successes — and intelligence failures.” The point is both insightful and ripe for self-justifying exploitation. Failure to register the weakness of the shah of Iran ahead of the 1979 revolution — “one of the most massive intelligence failures in history,” according to a senior American official at the time — can be waved away on the unfalsifiable grounds that policymakers wouldn’t have acted on accurate warnings anyway. And agency officials can, of course, point to plenty of instances in which their warnings went unheeded. Recently, those included warnings of a possible pandemic. In the early months of this year, the alerts emerged from various corners of the intelligence community, including C.I.A. operations on several continents, and made their way some dozen times into the President’s Daily Brief. The problem, among others, was that their customer had a habit of disregarding intelligence briefings, often talking through them (“mostly about what was on Fox News,” in the telling of a former White House official), or scrapping them altogether when he wasn’t in the mood. Yet if this administration is an extreme case, Whipple’s book should offer a reminder that the difficulties faced by intelligence officials under Trump are not entirely new. And even under a future president who does not tweet charges of treason or rant about the deep state, they will not vanish entirely. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
