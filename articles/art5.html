Novak Djokovic Is in His Way.<br></h1><p id="artcont">If Nadal defeats Djokovic on Sunday for his 13th championship at Roland Garros, he will match Roger Federer’s 20 singles titles in Grand Slam tournaments. By Christopher Clarey It should come as no surprise, even in autumn and in the midst of a pandemic, that Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic will meet in another French Open final. Djokovic is No. 1 and has not lost a completed match in this disjointed 2020 tennis season. Nadal is No. 2 and the greatest clay-court player in the game’s long history. Nadal will be aiming for his 13th French Open title, a preposterous total for any event, much less a Grand Slam tournament. Djokovic is aiming for his second. Both advanced on Friday with victories over younger men who had reason to hope for better. Nadal won, 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (0), against No. 12 seed Diego Schwartzman, who upset him on clay in the Italian Open last month. Djokovic won, 6-3, 6-2, 5-7, 4-6, 6-1, against No. 5 Stefanos Tsitsipas, who had already beaten him twice and who pushed him to five sets this time before his legs, if not his will, gave out. But Sunday’s showdown — the 56th match in the rich rivalry between Nadal and Djokovic, and their third meeting in the French Open final — will be about more than winning this unique October edition of Roland Garros. It will be about the historical pecking order. If Nadal prevails, he will equal Roger Federer’s men’s record of 20 Grand Slam singles titles. If Djokovic prevails, he will narrow the gap with his longtime rivals. The title would be his 18th and would make him the first of the so-called Big Three to win each of the four majors twice. Numbers, so many numbers. It is part of their legacy, and at times, their burden. Djokovic has the overall edge against Nadal, with a 29-26 advantage, but Nadal leads by 17-7 on clay and by 6-1 at Roland Garros. Djokovic is one of only two men to have defeated Nadal in this tournament. Robin Soderling beat Nadal in the fourth round in 2009, and Djokovic beat him in the quarterfinals in 2015, a rare downbeat year in Nadal’s career. Nadal is bracing himself for Sunday’s final. “I made a step forward today and played my best match of the tournament,” he said. “I will need one on Sunday that is even better.” “ Djokovic is shoring up the fortifications, too. “It’s his ‘maison,’” he said of Nadal, using the French word for house. “I will have to be at my best. Playing Nadal at Roland Garros is the biggest challenge in our sport.” Djokovic has certainly had the harder road to the final. While Nadal has not dropped a set in six matches, Djokovic has dropped three in his last two — going four sets with Pablo Carreño Busta in the quarterfinals and five with Tsitsipas, the swashbuckling 22-year-old Greek. Djokovic was in control until he served for a straight-set victory at 5-4 in the third set and, on match point, missed a backhand just wide going for a winner. Tsitsipas rallied to win the next three games and the set. Tsitsipas defeated Federer to reach his first Grand Slam semifinal at the 2019 Australian Open and also won last year’s ATP Finals, often considered the fifth most prestigious event in men’s tennis, after the majors. But he has struggled to close of late, blowing six match points against Borna Coric in a third-round loss at the U.S. Open. Though his hunger was palpable on Friday and his comeback inspired, he could not cross the finish line ahead of Djokovic, the elastic Serbian who at age 33 was the fresher man. “My body was not ready,” Tsitsipas said wearily. Djokovic, still sprinting corner to corner and baseline to net, closed out the victory with a string of return winners and more of the well-disguised drop shots that were so effective throughout the match. “He has reached almost perfection, Novak, in his game style, the way he plays, which is unbelievable to see, honestly,” Tsitsipas said. “That inspires me a lot to go out and work and try to reach that perfectionism, that ability to have everything on the court.”
