Most of the women in Maria Jose Bastias’s English language class, at Mujeres Unidas y Activas, a nonprofit in San Francisco, did not know that they could get a coronavirus test without health insurance, or that they were legally entitled to paid sick leave if they contracted the virus, regardless of their immigration status. They worked grueling hours at menial jobs that offered little security; it had not occurred to many of them to even ask about such benefits, let alone to expect them. But they all had heard about what happened at the nearby McDonald’s: Employees there asked their boss for face masks to wear at work, and were given dog diapers and coffee filters to use instead. The story didn’t surprise the women, who came mostly from Central America and had long been acquainted with the vagaries of American employment. But it did upset them. Their own communities had been hit hard by the virus; almost all of them knew someone who had died from it. And many of them had begun to doubt their own bosses’ assurances about the level of risk they themselves faced. Among other things, they had been told that the virus was a hoax; that masks were useless in any case; and that positive test results were often false and could therefore be ignored. Ms. Bastias asked the women what they were doing to protect themselves. Just praying, they told her. Their indifference did not reflect a lack of fear. They were plenty scared: One woman confessed that she had never taken her 4-month-old baby outside — not even for a doctor’s visit. But they had to work, and they had no power to make their work safer. Ms. Bastias has been trying to change that, by facilitating dialogues between the women, and by weaving lessons about public health and self-advocacy into her language instruction. With the pandemic stretching into its tenth month, the community where she works needs all the help it can get. The global death toll has topped a million, and this week the United States president, and several of his close contacts, tested positive for the coronavirus. It’s tempting to see in this latest development proof of the virus’s indifference: a foe so powerful it attacks presidents and paupers alike. But the numbers behind the ever-rising case counts and death tolls tell a very different story. Black and Latino Americans are roughly two to three times more likely than their white counterparts to contract the coronavirus, roughly four times more likely to be hospitalized by it, and nearly three times as likely to die from it. Latino children who contract the virus are eight times more likely to be hospitalized than white children, and Black children five times more likely. And of the 121 children who died from the virus through July, nearly 80 percent were children of color — 45 percent Latino and 29 percent Black, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Doctors and scientists who track case counts and death tolls are uniformly horrified by this disparity, and many worry that the true gap is probably even greater than the available data indicates. “We are looking at a historic decimation of the Hispanic communities in the United States,” says Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease doctor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “Not only are they dying at much higher rates, but they are also dying younger, which means we are losing working-aged adults and parents of school-aged children.” Deep, Tangled Roots Racial health disparities are neither new nor unique to this pandemic. Black and Latino Americans have faced higher rates of chronic illness and infant mortality for generations. Doctors and public health experts have been working for almost as long to both characterize and address these disparities, says Margaret Handley, an epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco. And they are determined to leverage the coronavirus crisis toward meaningful progress. “If one good thing comes out of Covid, it may be that we finally build the momentum to do this,” Dr. Handley said. But before the nation can possibly close its racial health gap, we have to understand it. When it comes to the coronavirus, the cause-and-effect relationships may seem so obvious as to barely warrant discussion: The workers who were deemed essential, and thus pressed to continue working outside of their homes even as most others sheltered in place — the transit, farm and food plant workers, the nursing home aides and cashiers and delivery people — came disproportionately from low-income communities of color. Many of them were also already nestled into a cluster of other risk factors — poor nutrition, inadequate health care, crowded housing — that made them especially vulnerable to the virus and its worst effects. But the roots of all these disparities are deep and difficult to disentangle. Chronic illness might stem clearly from diet and a lack of health insurance, but that doesn’t explain why Black and Latino Americans are more likely to suffer from food insecurity, or to work in low-paying jobs, in the first place. To answer those questions, you have to dig deeper — into housing, immigration, education and labor policies that date, in some cases, to the nation’s founding. “The ultimate driver is systemic racism,” says Robert Fields, a population health specialist at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. “But you can go upstream into infinity.” Research into what drives racial health gaps in the United States has been “paltry,” Dr. Fields told me. “There’s been a general push toward ignoring race altogether in medicine, so in a lot of cases we don’t even collect that information, let alone assess our performance on it.” The C.D.C. — normally the national hub for such data — has not helped matters. The agency’s data on racial breakdowns of coronavirus cases is woefully incomplete. The agency has said it can’t force individual states to report that data in greater detail. But critics say that health officials have been deliberately vague and confusing. “You have to be a Talmudic scholar to understand what they are trying to say,” said Dr. Nancy Krieger, an epidemiologist and expert in racial health disparities at Harvard University.
