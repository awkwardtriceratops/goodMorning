By The Editorial Board The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. For a quarter of a century now, Aleksandr Lukashenko has been offering a master class in dictatorship in Belarus, the country he runs with an iron hand. But after the blatantly rigged election of Aug. 9, the next lesson should be in how dictatorships are brought to an end. The son of a milkmaid and chairman of a Soviet state farm when the Soviet Union collapsed, Mr. Lukashenko was catapulted to power in Belarus’s first democratic presidential election. He then made sure it was the last free and fair one — reshaping the old Soviet K.G.B. security apparatus into a personal machine for crushing any opposition, bringing the parliament, judiciary and media under his firm control and earning the dubious title, “Europe’s last dictator.” With generous support from Russia, largely in the form of gas and oil at privileged prices, to make sure that he did not turn westward, Mr. Lukashenko managed to retain a measure of popular support by avoiding the chaotic, large-scale privatizations that afflicted Russia and most other former Soviet republics and keeping key industries — and their jobs and patronage — in government hands. Yet well before the latest election, Mr. Lukashenko’s sixth, things were not looking good. His silly and incompetent response to the coronavirus pandemic, which included urging his subjects to ride tractors, take saunas and drink vodka, alienated many people as the disease spread and the economy shrank. His usual tactics — jailing or disqualifying any serious challengers — backfired when Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, a former English teacher and the wife of a popular pro-democracy blogger arrested after he declared his candidacy, took her husband’s place. Her entire platform, appealing in its passion and simplicity, consisted of pledges to release all political prisoners and hold free and fair elections. Her rallies drew massive crowds, and on Election Day, long lines formed at polling stations. Mr. Lukashenko stuck to his familiar script and claimed an utterly improbable landslide victory, ceding less than a tenth of the votes to Ms. Tikhanovskaya — “Our society has not matured enough to vote for a woman,” he said. In the absence of credible monitors or exit polls, it is impossible to know how many votes Ms. Tikhanovskaya actually got, but it is nearly certain she won. In some polling stations where the real results leaked out, she had received as much as 70 percent of the vote. When the streets of the capital, Minsk, and other cities and towns erupted in angry demonstrations, Mr. Lukashenko’s black-shirted thugs responded with extraordinary viciousness. Demonstrators were beaten with batons and boots; thousands were detained; and those who were later released told of being packed into small cells and systematically beaten, their screams filling prisons. On her way to file a formal complaint, Ms. Tikhanovskaya was picked up by the police and, after three hours, made an obviously coerced statement ceding the election and asking people not to protest. Soon afterward she fled to neighboring Lithuania. The violence only bred more resistance. Women dressed in white and holding flowers have formed human chains in Minsk and other cities to protest the police brutality. Spontaneous strikes broke out in several state-owned factories. Svetlana Alexievich, the Belarusian Nobel literature laureate, accused Mr. Lukashenko of declaring war on his own people and demanded that he step down. In an attempt to quell the anger, the government pledged to release detained protesters. But it also affirmed the results of the sham election, making clear that Mr. Lukashenko will not go quietly or peaceably. Belarus is not Ukraine, where powerful regional differences, competing political factions and powerful oligarchs kept the government from amassing the centralized, militarized power Mr. Lukashenko wields. The European Union and the United States have issued strong statements condemning the police violence and election fraud, and there is talk of imposing sanctions on responsible officials. Such sanctions have been imposed before, and Mr. Lukashenko long ago learned tactical gestures — like releasing some political prisoners — to prod the West into reaching back out to him. The Trump administration was in the process of restoring an ambassador to Minsk when the crisis struck. The truth is that Mr. Lukashenko has never really changed his stripes, and there is no chance he will if he survives the current challenge. The protesters in the streets of Belarusian cities are not risking beatings and even their lives to win a few more tactical feints from their oppressors, but to demand that their election victory be honored and that Mr. Lukashenko cede power when his term ends in early September. “Belarus will never again want to live under its previous rulers,” Ms. Tikhanovskaya said in a video message from her refuge in Lithuania, calling on the government to start talking about a transfer of power. Belarusians do not need more indignant statements from the West; they need the West to join them in declaring that the official election results are fraudulent, in demanding an unconditional release of all detained demonstrators and in calling for new elections. This would meet stiff resistance from Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom Mr. Lukashenko, whatever his warts, is a bulwark against Western encroachment. The Belarusian dictator has made a point of defying Mr. Putin of late — he did not support Russia’s clandestine war in eastern Ukraine; in April 2019 he expelled the Russian ambassador, accusing him of treating Belarus like a vassal state; and last month he arrested 33 men he said were Russian mercenaries there to stir up trouble in advance of the election. At the same time, Belarus has drawn closer to Beijing, from which it received a $500 million loan in December. But Mr. Putin has swallowed all these insults, and he was quick to congratulate Mr. Lukashenko on his “victory.” The West’s sympathies and unquestionable support must be with people of Belarus who have had enough of Mr. Lukashenko’s willful, cruel and illegitimate rule. The European Union and the United States have made a good start by painting the Belarus election as neither free nor fair and condemning the crackdown on demonstrators. They can do more: They can warn Mr. Lukashenko that they do not accept the official results and will not recognize him as the winner unless he calls off his thugs and there is a new and credible election. To underscore the point, Washington should hold off sending a new ambassador to Minsk. The last lesson on dictatorship should be that people will not abide tyranny forever, and that when they finally can bear no more, free people elsewhere will come to their side.
