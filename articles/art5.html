Also Sunday, the doubles fields begin their quarterfinal matchups. By Max Gendler How to watch: From 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern time on ESPN2; streaming on the ESPN app. On Sunday, the severely thinned ranks of the singles draw will begin the fourth round of the United States Open with 75 percent of the field knocked out. While some of the betting favorites are still cruising, there are plenty of speed bumps to overcome as the knockout format causes players on hot streaks to collide. Because of the number of matches cycling through courts, the times for individual matchups are best estimates and are certain to fluctuate based on the completion times of earlier play. All times are Eastern. ARTHUR ASHE STADIUM | 10 P.M. Osaka, the 2018 U.S. Open champion, seemed frustrated at times during her third-round victory over Marta Kostyuk. While dealing with hamstring concerns, Osaka has seemed to oscillate between being in complete control of her points and sitting back entirely and hoping her opponents will play themselves into a mistake. As the tournament continues, it will be interesting to see if Osaka can stay sharp, as she did in a dominant second-round win over Caroline Garcia. Kontaveit, the 14th seed, has been consistent through her last two rounds, winning both easily in straight sets after struggling to win her first-round match over Danielle Collins. Kontaveit, of Estonia, reached the quarterfinals at the Australian Open in January but will have a hard time matching that feat against Osaka. Kontaveit’s variety of play will be her main weapon here. If she can throw off Osaka’s rhythm, she’ll still have a chance to upset the former champion. ARTHUR ASHE STADIUM | 7 P.M. Goffin, the seventh seed, can be described simply as a consistency player. On the court, he has the tendency to make his opponents hit just one more ball than they’re comfortable with, leading them into unforced errors. Goffin has also shown his consistency in his results, finishing his U.S. Open runs in the fourth round for the last three years. Now, having reached the round of 16 once again, he’ll be trying to make his first quarterfinal in Flushing Meadows by outlasting an in-form Shapovalov.
