At age 81, she has spent the last 60 years or so thinking about “how important one line can be,” she told me when I arrived at her Long Island studio on a Saturday morning in August. She was eager to discuss her paintings and her career, especially her exhibition at the Menil Collection in Houston, “Virginia Jaramillo: The Curvilinear Paintings, 1969—1974,” on view from Sept. 26 to July 3. The Menil show is Ms. Jaramillo’s first solo museum show. Ever. In the roomy studio, attached to her split-level house, were some of her lines in action. She had been working on a large, rectangular painting, “Quantum Entanglement,” in which thin, wavy marks in bright colors reach out from a hazy area on each side of a black background and then jumble together in the middle. “It’s a scientific theory about two particles in space that interact,” she said, explaining the title. “No matter how far away they are in a galaxy, they can still relate to one another. It could be one one-hundredth of a second, but there’s still a vibrancy.” Ms. Jaramillo (pronounced hara-ME-oh) has vibrancy to spare. She laughs and swears easily, and she had put out some nuts and some chocolate doughnuts for me. We had our masks on, but she didn’t seem overly concerned about an in-person interview during a pandemic. The Menil exhibition has just eight paintings but it demonstrates her ability to squeeze impact out of a deceptively simple composition. “Green Dawn” (1970), for instance, is a verdant rectangle with just one thin, wavy yellow line that seems to be wandering away from the upper right corner. “That little line is off on a journey — but it changes its mind, it’s a flirt,” said Kellie Jones, a professor of art history and archaeology at Columbia University who helped give Ms. Jaramillo a career boost in 2011. Ms. Jones included Ms. Jaramillo in the show “Now Dig This!: Art and Black Los Angeles, 1960—1980,” at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles.
