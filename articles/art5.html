What’s Going On?<br></h1><p id="artcont">Eight people have been fatally attacked this year, the most in nearly a century. But scientists say these numbers don’t tell the full story. By Livia Albeck-Ripka MELBOURNE, Australia — The shark attacked on Sunday, when Charles Cernobori, 59 and a father of three, was bodysurfing off Cable Beach in Western Australia. A couple found him, dragged him to the beach and called emergency services. By the time they arrived, it was too late to save Mr. Cernobori. His death was the eighth linked to a shark in Australia this year, the most in nearly a century. The record for shark attacks in a single year was in 1929, which saw nine. In recent decades, the annual average has been one. What’s behind the increase in deaths? The question is vexing many in Australia, where public pressure is rising for authorities to take tougher measures to protect the country’s picturesque coasts this summer as people emerge from coronavirus lockdowns and eagerly head to the beach.
