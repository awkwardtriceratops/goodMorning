By Will Wright PORTLAND, Ore. — Right-wing and left-wing groups clashed in front of the U.S. courthouse in Portland, Ore., on Saturday, weeks after federal agents pulled back from the site of protests that have gripped part of the city’s downtown for months. A group of about 200 protesters, including members of the Proud Boys and families supporting the police, gathered along the courthouse sidewalk beginning at 11 a.m. Many of them were holding American flags, while others carried assault rifles and wore tactical military gear. Almost immediately, a similar number of Black Lives Matter protesters gathered across the street, many dressed in all black and carrying shields or paintball guns. Within an hour, shouting turned to violence. Paintballs flew between the two sides. Bottles soared back and forth. Shoves became punches. As protesters who were struck with pepper spray moved back, others came forward to take their place. All the while, police officers watched from a distance and chose not to intervene. The Portland Police Bureau said in a news release that it did not declare a riot because it had limited personnel for the number of protesters and weapons present. The statement said that weeks of “violent actions directed at the police” were “a major consideration for determining if police resources are necessary to interject between two groups with individuals who appear to be willingly engaging in physical confrontations for short durations.” Several people were punched or hit with objects, although there did not appear to be serious injuries. Mike Redwood, a Black Lives Matter protester, said he was hit in the face with a baton and Tased during an altercation with far-right demonstrators. “I still have all my teeth and nothing’s broken, so I guess it’s not that bad for being hit with a bat,” he said while holding an ice pack to his cheek. For about three hours, the two sides were in almost constant conflict, much of it violent. Mr. Redwood said that he and several other Black Lives Matter protesters had occupied part of the street, and that he held his ground when the opposing line advanced.
