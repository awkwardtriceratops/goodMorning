By David Leonhardt Want to get The Morning by email? Here’s the sign-up. Election Day is 40 days away, but voting is already underway in several states. To help you vote during this unusual year — in a country where voting is already more difficult than in most other democracies — we have put together a step-by-step guide. Register. Check your registration status through a national group of state officials or at Vote.org. If you aren’t registered, move quickly. The earliest deadlines, including in Florida and Arizona, are less than two weeks away. In 40 states, voters can register online. In others, like Texas, you’ll have to mail in a form or submit it in person. You can also use a one-stop hub from the group When We All Vote, which lets you enter your address and then offers information on how to register and vote. Vote by mail. Most states have loosened their rules during the pandemic, but they differ by state. In many places, you must first fill out an online form requesting a mail-in ballot. You should pay careful attention to your state’s rules for returning a ballot. In Pennsylvania, for example, you must enclose it in two envelopes. In North Carolina, a witness must sign your ballot. Ignore these rules, and your vote may be thrown out. Historically, mail ballots are rejected much more often than in-person ballots (although some states are taking steps to reduce rejection rates this year). To meet your state’s deadline for mail-in ballots, the safest bet is to vote as soon as you know which candidates you support. If you live in one of the many states with drop-off locations, you may want to visit one of them rather than mailing in the ballot. Most states will also let you track the status of completed mail ballots. Or vote in person. Voting in person during the pandemic appears to be about as safe as going to the grocery store — low risk but not no risk. Many states are taking measures, like spacing out voting booths, to increase safety. You should also wear a mask and stay at least six feet from others. In most states, you can vote early even if you’re voting in person. Make a plan. Social-science research has found that people who make a specific voting plan — exactly when and where they will vote — are more likely to do so than people who vaguely promise themselves that they will. Once you’ve made that plan, tell others about it, in person or in your social-media feed. The announcement will help you stick to the plan and encourage others to do the same. You can also use a platform like Outvote to encourage your friends and relatives to vote, via text messages and social media. Protesters took to the streets in multiple cities after a grand jury in Louisville, Ky., declined to charge the two officers who fatally shot Breonna Taylor in March. Most protests were peaceful, but not all: In Louisville, two police officers were shot. Both are expected to survive. The grand jury did indict one former detective for recklessly firing into another apartment during a raid of Taylor’s home, as the police searched for evidence against her ex-boyfriend. President Trump took new steps to question basic democratic principles that other presidents of both parties have long supported. At a news conference, he declined to endorse a peaceful transfer of power after the November election, saying, “We’re going to have to see what happens.” He also repeated false allegations claiming widespread voter fraud and said he wanted to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg quickly so the Supreme Court could resolve any election dispute. (A long read: The Atlantic explains why the mechanics of American democracy are “at meaningful risk of breaking down” this year.) The campaign: A new poll by The New York Times and Siena College shows Trump struggling in three states he won in 2016: He trails in Iowa, is tied with Joe Biden in Georgia and has a small lead in Texas. The results are broadly similar to those from other recent polls. Hundreds of mourners, including dozens of Ginsburg’s former clerks, honored her as a pioneer of women’s rights at the Supreme Court. “She forced the courts to see us as human and that we had brains and we deserve our full rights,” said one woman, who drove from Grayslake, Ill., to be there. President Xi Jinping pledged that China would reach “carbon neutrality” by 2060, meaning its net carbon emissions would reach zero. The move is “potentially enormous,” one expert said. But it won’t be easy: China is the world’s biggest polluter and has increasingly turned to coal in the past few years. California announced its own lofty climate goal: The state plans to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035. Last year, only about 8 percent of passenger vehicles sold in the state were not gasoline-powered. Johnson & Johnson has begun the final stage of clinical trials for its coronavirus vaccine. One advantage of its vaccine, researchers say, is that it may require only one dose, unlike most others. An investigation by Senate Republicans into corruption allegations against Biden and his son found no evidence of improper influence or wrongdoing in Ukraine. A former National Security Council official said political appointees in the White House asked her to sign a declaration falsely asserting that John Bolton had revealed classified material in his book. The Metropolitan Opera, the largest performing arts organization in the U.S., announced that it would not reopen for another year, and others arts programs and venues may follow its lead. Lives Lived: Gale Sayers was a will-o’-the-wisp running back who in a short but brilliant career with the Chicago Bears left opponents, as they used to say, clutching at air. He died on Wednesday at 77 from complications of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
