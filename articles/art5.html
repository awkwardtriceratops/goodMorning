By Nicholas Fandos and Emily Cochrane WASHINGTON — Louis DeJoy, the embattled postmaster general whose cost-cutting and operational changes have prompted widespread concern about mail-in voting, said on Friday he was “extremely highly confident” the Postal Service could facilitate the largest vote-by-mail program in American history and called suggestions that he might intentionally slow ballot delivery to help President Trump “outrageous.” Testifying before Congress for the first time amid a political firestorm, Mr. DeJoy, a major donor to Mr. Trump, defended many of the changes put in place as necessary to help the Postal Service get its financial house in order. He acknowledged that the moves have slowed some mail delivery and reiterated that he would suspend his cost-cutting measures until after the election. “There has been no changes to any policies with regard to election mail,” Mr. DeJoy said, adding, “The Postal Service is fully capable and committed to delivering the nation’s election mail fully and on time.” Under questioning from Democrats, however, he refused to unwind other steps, like removing hundreds of blue mailboxes and mail sorting machines, that he said were initiated by his predecessors in response to a steady decline in mail volume. He denied knowledge of the machine removal when it first began, telling senators it was “not a critical issue within the Postal Service.” And he was unable to offer many specifics about how the Postal Service would ensure on-time delivery of ballots, telling Senator Maggie Hassan, Democrat of New Hampshire, that he would be unable to provide a detailed plan by Sunday because it was still being drafted. Mr. DeJoy said he would continue the agency’s practice of prioritizing election mail, regardless of what postage is used, and “deploy processes and procedures that advance any election mail, in some cases ahead of first-class mail.” As Mr. DeJoy testified on Friday, a coalition of six states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against him, the Postal Service and the chairman of its board of governors, Robert M. Duncan. The attorneys general allege that Mr. DeJoy’s recent changes have resulted in widespread delays that could have a disastrous effect for voting by mail this November. His recent announcement, suspending many new initiatives, did not address several of his changes, the states claim. Concerns about the ability of Americans to vote by mail during a pandemic have been heightened by Mr. Trump, who has criticized the Postal Service as a “joke” and renewed his attack on mail-in voting hours after Mr. DeJoy finished assuring lawmakers that voting by mail was the Postal Service’s No. 1 priority. “You’ll have double voting — where they send in a ballot, then they’ll go and vote,” Mr. Trump said in remarks to a conservative group of supporters in Virginia. “That’s going to be a big problem. They’ll send in their ballot and they’ll vote, too. They’ll send in the ballot. What are the chances that some states so efficiently run — ‘Oh, gee, you can’t vote, we just got your ballot last night at seven o’clock.’ I mean think of how ridiculous it is, right? Common sense.” Mr. DeJoy said he had “never spoken to the president about the Postal Service, other than to congratulate me when I accepted the position.” But he did not back down from his plans to radically overhaul the postal system, saying he foresees “drastic” changes after the election in November, including rate hikes, changes to service standards in rural America, and a slew of other potential moves that would cut costs but could significantly alter the service the beleaguered Postal Service provides. “We are considering dramatic changes to improve the service to the American people, yes,” Mr. DeJoy said, later adding that “I would like to be liberated on pricing.” He also challenged lawmakers — who are debating whether to give the Postal Service an infusion of cash — saying they should make serious legislative changes to free the Postal Service from retirement benefit obligations that Congress imposed years ago. By law, the Postal Service is required to pre-fund its retirement benefits programs, a mandate that has driven the agency billions of dollars into the red and forced its leaders to contemplate costly service changes. “If we just throw $25 billion at us this year and we don’t do anything, we’ll be back in two years,” Mr. DeJoy said, referring to an emergency approval of cash the House planned to approve on Saturday to help the Postal Service weather the coronavirus pandemic. The new postmaster general, who has been on the job fewer than 70 days, pushed back on claims that he had cut overtime for mail carriers and he defended attempts to cut down on late and extra delivery trips. He said agency statistics when he arrived showed that 12 percent of the trips mail carriers made each day were running late and that thousands of extra trips were being made to account for missed mail — performance that he argued would be unacceptable at private delivery services like FedEx. Carrying out the changes had been rockier than expected, he conceded, but Mr. DeJoy initially played down the costs. Pressed later on by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, with the “heartbreaking stories” of Americans, including veterans, missing medicine because of those delays, he offered a measured apology. “Senator, we are working here feverishly to get the system running at stability and also to hire more workers to handle the delivery process,” he said. “We all feel bad about what the dip in our service, the level it has been.” Lawmakers in both parties were most concerned that the post office might not be able to handle a crush of mail-in ballots for the 2020 election in the middle of a pandemic. He said the agency planned to send a letter to every American next month explaining its plans for safely transmitting ballots, and he assured Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, that “we will scour every plant each night leading up to Election Day” for ballots. Senator Gary Peters of Michigan, the top Democrat on the Senate homeland security panel, told Mr. DeJoy that his decisions “have cost Americans their health, their time, their livelihoods and their peace of mind.” “I believe you owe them an apology for the harm you have caused,” Mr. Peters said. And grilled by Senator Jacky Rosen, Democrat of Nevada, Mr. DeJoy refused to commit to providing transcripts or minutes of all closed, nonpublic board of governor meetings, as well as an analysis of the effect of the changes on veterans, working families and older Americans. Instead, he promised to provide “the analysis that designed the truck schedule that I directed.” Mr. DeJoy’s defense on Friday came a day after the former vice chairman of the Postal Service’s board of governors offered lawmakers a scathing account of the agency under the Trump administration. David C. Williams, a former Postal Service inspector general who resigned as vice chairman in protest in April, accused the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, of trying to engineer a hostile takeover of the service, telling lawmakers that Mr. Mnuchin required members of the independent board to “kiss the ring” before they were confirmed and issued demands that agency officials believed were “illegal.” Mr. Williams warned that Mr. Mnuchin’s demands, some of which Mr. DeJoy appeared intent on carrying out, would drive the agency with centuries-old roots into the ground. Mr. Williams also cast doubt on Mr. DeJoy’s qualifications for the job and the process by which he was selected to lead the agency. Mr. DeJoy, who appeared by video conference, is scheduled to be back before Congress on Monday for another hearing, this time with the House Oversight and Reform Committee, a more hostile, Democratic-led panel.
