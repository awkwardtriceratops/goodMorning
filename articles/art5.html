By Rick Rojas ATLANTA — Tropical Storm Marco significantly weakened before making landfall on Monday night, largely sparing the Gulf Coast from the “one-two punch” of back-to-back hurricanes that meteorologists had warned might pummel Louisiana and Texas. Still, officials in those states implored residents to maintain their vigilance as Tropical Storm Laura continued to gain strength while bounding toward them on a roughly parallel course. Some areas within Laura’s path issued mandatory evacuation orders, including Port Arthur, Texas, which has the nation’s largest oil refinery, and Cameron Parish, La., just across the state line. Oil and gas companies also began evacuating workers from offshore production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Tracking two tropical storms that could make landfall on the Gulf Coast this week. Elsewhere along the coast, the authorities urged residents to hunker down or clear out before Laura arrives, which forecasters said on Monday could intensify into a Category 2 hurricane. “I guess if I’ve got a message, it’s not to assume that Laura is going to do a similar favor” and lose steam the way Marco had, Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said during a briefing on Monday. Still, Mr. Edwards acknowledged relief as his state avoided being walloped by two hurricanes within a span of 48 hours — a rare occurrence that would have presented formidable challenges for even the most seasoned veterans of Gulf Coast storms. Just a day earlier, he had warned of dual threats that could have kept residents sheltering in place for days and recovery efforts after Marco that could have been hampered by Laura’s arrival. But Marco, which had been upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday, dissipated back into a tropical storm on Monday before making landfall near the mouth of the Mississippi River around 6 p.m. local time. Officials said they would use the reprieve to better prepare for Laura, which swept over Cuba on Monday and was on course to hit southwest Louisiana by Wednesday night. Meteorologists said Laura would unleash heavy rainfall across Cuba and Jamaica, possibly triggering mudslides and flash flooding. The storm was expected to increase in strength as it reached the Gulf of Mexico’s warm waters, with forecasters warning of increasing risks of storm surge, powerful winds and heavy rainfall. Cameron Parish, in southwestern Louisiana, issued a mandatory evacuation order starting at 1 p.m. Monday. And in Port Arthur, the mayor, Thurman Bartie, told reporters he planned to issue a mandatory evacuation order for the city effective at 6 a.m. on Tuesday. Parts of the city were already under a voluntary evacuation order on Monday. Oil and gas companies typically clear workers from the offshore platforms that dot the Gulf of Mexico as hurricanes and tropical storms approach. By midday Sunday, oil and gas companies had evacuated 114 platforms, or nearly 18 percent of the 643 manned platforms in the Gulf, according to the Federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Roughly 58 percent of Gulf oil production and 45 percent of natural gas output has been “shut-in,” a standard procedure in which safety valves below the surface of the ocean floor are closed to prevent the release of oil or gas. “We are nearing completion of the evacuation of all nonessential personnel,” Royal Dutch Shell said in a statement on Sunday. “We have safely shut in production at all but one of our assets in the Gulf of Mexico. All well operations have now been safely secured.” Shell also said it would screen all of its workers for the coronavirus before they returned to work after the storms had passed. Louisiana officials suspended coronavirus testing on Monday as the state prepared for the two tropical storms. Though tests remain available through hospitals and urgent care facilities, the state closed its own sites through at least Wednesday, state health officials said. The shutdown of these testing sites will likely create “some kind of disruption in data collection,” said Kevin Litten, a spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Health. Without testing for at least two days, there will quite likely be a jump in cases when it resumes, Mr. Litten noted, adding that power outages at reporting facilities could also affect data collection. Updated August 24, 2020 Governor Edwards urged residents to continue with virus precautions even as they navigate the storms. The state, which had been an early hot spot for the coronavirus in the spring, has been among the hardest hit, and Mr. Edwards was wary of ceding any of its recent progress. As of Monday morning, there have been at least 143,084 virus cases and 4,746 deaths in Louisiana during the pandemic, according to a New York Times database. “We do want to remind people as you prepare for these storms, Marco and Laura, that there’s still an awful lot of Covid out there,” Mr. Edwards, a Democrat, said. “That should influence everything you do in terms of preparing for the storms.” In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency over the weekend for 23 counties and encouraged residents on Monday to keep track of weather alerts and heed official warnings. “Property and belongings can be restored, but lives cannot,” Mr. Abbott, a Republican, said. “I call on all Texans who may be in harm’s way to put their safety and their family’s lives above all else.” Yet even with Marco fading from hurricane strength, officials still said the dual storms forced them to negotiate a difficult set of circumstances. Forecasters from the National Hurricane Center expected Marco to deliver gusty winds, heavy rainfall and coastal flooding. And with Laura looming right behind it, officials said there was a limited window to assess Marco’s toll; utility companies also said it could take longer to restore any service that was knocked out. Brad Kieserman, the vice president for disaster operations and logistics for the American Red Cross, said recovery efforts would benefit from the weaker storm arriving first. “If the first hit you take is the lighter hit, you can prepare yourself for the harder hit,” Mr. Kieserman said. While two storms in such rapid succession might be remarkably rare, he said, the Red Cross has become well practiced at juggling multiple disasters, as it is now with the storms on the Gulf Coast and the wildfires in California. “This rapid-fire pace we’re at right now is something, unfortunately, we’ve had to do and improve at in the last five years,” he said, noting that there have been at least 10 disasters with more than $1 billion in uninsured loss in the past several years. “We’ve had to learn how to do this.” Chelsea Brasted contributed reporting from New Orleans, and Gillian Friedman from Seattle. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
