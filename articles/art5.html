By Alyson Krueger Two years ago, Brian Sheehy saw something crazy on the internet: Videos of people who looked like they were flying over water on futuristic contraptions called eFoils. Mr. Sheehy was obsessed. He immediately bought two as soon as they were available and taught himself to use them. He now stores the five-foot-long boards on the balcony of his apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. “They drive my wife crazy, because we don’t have a place to store them, and they take up a lot of space,” he said. During his free time he lugs them into an Uber and then finds a spot on the banks of one of the city’s rivers, or the Long Island Sound. “It’s the coolest new thing that I am aware of,” said Mr. Sheehy, 49, an investment fund manager. “This is my dream toy.” The eFoil, short for electric hydrofoil surfboard, was brought to market by Nick Leason, an engineer and avid surfer in Puerto Rico. Technology from smartphones, electric vehicles and drones was used to create a remote-controlled board that could fly over the water without wind or waves. Now the boards are sold by two companies: Lift, owned by Mr. Leason, and Flite, owned by David Trewern, a sailer and surfer in Australia.
