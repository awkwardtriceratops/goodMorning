This Winter, They Have a Chance to Prove It<br></h1><p id="artcont">We need a better system of transferring patients to ensure the best care during the next phase of the pandemic. By Theodore J. Iwashyna Dr. Iwashyna is a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan. ANN ARBOR, Mich. — As hospitals in much of the country face a surge in patients with Covid-19 and the threat of influenza this fall and winter, we must be on guard against attempts to restrict patient admissions or limit intensive-care capacity. The incentives will certainly be there for hospitals to do so. During the first Covid-19 surge in the spring, hospitals collectively lost over $200 billion and are on track to lose more than $320 billion overall by the end of the year. Large academic medical centers were forced to forgo lucrative elective procedures as they absorbed high patient loads driven by the coronavirus. But they offer the most severely ill their best shot at survival and must keep their doors open to the sickest patients. The possibility that some hospitals might seek to exclude patients, particularly those who are poor and vulnerable, was underscored recently by a report in The Wall Street Journal that several large California hospital systems “improperly refused or delayed accepting Covid-19 patients based on their insurance status.” Severely ill patients were left waiting for care, the paper reported, and other hospitals swamped by the virus were stretched. That was not an isolated example. In Chicago in May, the pandemic revealed a fragmented and uncoordinated system of transferring patients, according to a report by WBEZ, the public radio station there. Hospitals had “to play a stressful game of ‘who do you know,’ leaning on longstanding relationships to transfer Covid-19 patients,” the station reported. After finding it hard to transfer patients, overwhelmed small hospitals “stopped even trying to send patients,” resigning themselves to making do on their own. In New York at the height of the pandemic in April, The Times reported, “patients at some community hospitals were three times more likely to die as patients at medical centers in the wealthiest parts of the city.” Doctors at two major New York hospital systems complained about inequities in care between their flagship hospitals and satellite facilities. Nationwide data suggest the same story. Hospitals don’t need formal exclusion policies to produce inequity. They can simply forgo efforts to attract underserved and seriously ill patients, and allow the inefficiencies and user-hostility of modern health care bureaucracies to do the rest. Such retrenchment and focusing on traditional, well-insured lines of business might seem financially prudent. But it will kill the most vulnerable among us, who are disproportionately Black and brown. Covid-19 and influenza can cause severe respiratory failure that is rarely seen otherwise. Patients need minute-to-minute attention for days, sometimes weeks. That care is best delivered at major medical centers, where not only last-ditch miraculous technology that can matter is available, but also all the details of a patient’s care, attended to with skills honed over years of caring for similar patients: making sure the diagnosis is correct, preventing ventilators from further damaging lungs, tweaking medicines to minimize the terrors of delirium, working to keep skin intact and muscles strong, finding and fixing complications, and integrating patients into recovery programs. This spring, community hospitals in Detroit, 45 miles to the east of us, were in deep distress, so my hospital in Ann Arbor accepted an influx of Detroiters — some of whom lacked health insurance — as transfers. It lightened the load on those urban community hospitals and offered patients in the most peril specialized expertise. It was our moral imperative to do so. Of course, federal law also requires hospitals that participate in Medicare to screen and stabilize patients with emergency medical conditions, regardless of their ability to pay, and to arrange a transfer to another medical facility if the hospital is unable to care for a patient. But I worry whether hospitals like mine will continue to reach out to those communities if the financial pressures of the pandemic reassert themselves.
