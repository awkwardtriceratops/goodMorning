By Nate Cohn A wave of new national surveys shows that Joe Biden maintains a significant if slightly diminished lead over Donald J. Trump, leaving him in a stronger position to oust an incumbent president than any challenger heading into his party’s convention in the modern polling era. On average, Mr. Biden leads by eight to nine percentage points among likely voters. His advantage is perhaps slightly smaller than it was a month ago, when high-quality live-interview telephone surveys routinely showed him with a double-digit lead. But it is still the largest and most persistent national polling lead that any candidate has held in 24 years, since Bill Clinton maintained a double-digit advantage in 1996. The conventions often introduce a volatile and uncertain period for public polling, as candidates usually gain in the polls after several days in the limelight on national television. Though it’s possible that the virtual nature of this year’s conventions will dampen that effect, this may be the last unbiased measurement of the state of the race until mid-September. For now, the state of the race is clear, ending a nearly two-month period when live-interview and online polls showed a modestly different race. The new consensus can be attributed mainly to a shift among live-interview telephone surveys, which show a two-point shift in Mr. Trump’s direction. The online polls have remained largely unchanged. The slight narrowing of Mr. Biden’s lead tracks with a similarly modest improvement in the president’s job approval rating. Over all, Mr. Trump’s approval rating among registered voters has increased to 42.2 percent, according to FiveThirtyEight, from its low of 40.3 percent on July 28.
