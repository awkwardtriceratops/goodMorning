By Annie Karni Next up for convention weirdness: the Republican Party. A group of delegates — six representing each state, territory and the District of Columbia for a total of 336 — is expected to begin arriving this weekend for the Republican National Convention before a formal roll call on Monday morning in Charlotte, N.C. There, President Trump will be nominated in a ballroom at the Charlotte Convention Center to lead his party for another four years. The gathering will be muted compared with what was originally envisioned, before the coronavirus pandemic upended both parties’ convention plans. Charlotte, originally prepared to host a raucous presidential renomination celebration, will now be where the procedural party business will take place. Republican National Committee members will gather over the weekend for their annual summer meeting. And Mr. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of congressional lawmakers are expected to arrive on Monday for the televised, in-person roll call and for brief nomination speeches. The Democrats held four nights of virtual programming this week for the Democratic National Convention. Next week, the Republicans will take over the Mellon Auditorium in Washington as the hub for their broadcasts, and the main speeches will take place at the White House and at Fort McHenry in Maryland. But Charlotte, selected more than two years ago as the site for the Republican National Convention, has the distinction this year of being the only in-person portion of either party’s quadrennial gathering. “I’m very excited about attending,” said Laura Cox, the chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party. She said the delegation representing her state was chosen months ago, when the plan was to take a chartered plane directly from Charlotte to Jacksonville, Fla., after the roll call, for the rest of the convention. “People are sad not to be able to participate in the convention, but at least there’s this piece of it,” Ms. Cox said. In June, Mr. Trump abruptly moved the convention to Jacksonville after reaching a stalemate with Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat, over social distancing rules. The president had no interest in speaking in front of a less-than-packed arena because delegates were forced to stand six feet away from one another. But Mr. Trump was eventually forced to scrap the Jacksonville plans in favor of four nights of virtual prime-time programming that will feature party leaders speaking from a variety of federal properties. (The Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activities while on the job, be damned.) Even just bringing delegates together in person — and indoors — has required months of planning by Republican officials, who submitted a 42-page health plan to North Carolina officials and hired a doctor, Jeffrey W. Runge, to serve as a senior adviser to the convention proceedings.
