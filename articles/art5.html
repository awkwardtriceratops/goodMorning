To the Editor: Re “Portland Death Inflames Debate on Urban Strife” (front page, Aug. 31): These are fearful days in America. Parents fear sending their children back to school during a deadly pandemic. Workers fear losing their jobs in a collapsing economy. Hundreds of thousands without paychecks or unemployment payments fear losing their homes. And millions of Black Americans fear that any confrontation with the police could have fatal consequences. At a time when so many Americans are already living in fear, the last thing we need is a president ready and willing to stoke those fears for his political advantage. Warning that America will collapse into anarchy if he isn’t re-elected, President Trump seeks to cast himself as a savior who can rescue us from pandemics, protesters and immigrants while warning that those who oppose him will destroy America as we know it. But the nation has faced great challenges many times before. We have survived economic panics, recessions and the Great Depression. We have endured through slavery and Jim Crow, lynchings, the Ku Klux Klan and race riots. Americans have proved to be a strong people, capable of great courage and sacrifice in the face of threats of all kind. Americans won’t be fooled by Republican fear-mongering in this election. We’ll once again turn away from fear and install leaders who provide hope for a better future. Robert T. Koenig
