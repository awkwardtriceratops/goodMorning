By Talya Minsberg and Alan Blinder MINNEAPOLIS — To the Big Ten Conference’s leaders and medical advisers, the announcement Wednesday that the league would play football this autumn was a scientific masterstroke and an athletic triumph. In some Big Ten cities, however, public health experts worried it could create an off-the-field epidemiological crisis. “The Big Ten has come up with an excellent, safe plan for the actual football game, for the athletes, for the coaches,” said Linda Vail, the health officer in Ingham County, Mich., which includes Michigan State University. “The problem is the tailgating off campus, the large parties and all of that sort of stuff, and that is concerning — deeply, deeply concerning.” More than 8,500 cases of the coronavirus have been reported at Big Ten universities over the course of the pandemic. Coupled with unnervingly large new outbreaks in some communities, the conference’s decision to proceed with football has invited fresh rounds of questions in several college towns. Public health officials around colleges beyond the Big Ten are harboring even more urgent worries as universities play games, or prepare to play in the coming weeks, sometimes with tens of thousands of fans in their stadiums. But within the Big Ten’s footprint, ranging from rural Pennsylvania to major cities like Minneapolis, officials spent more than five weeks under the impression that they would not have to reckon with football and all of the chaos, sanctioned and not, that can come with every kickoff, touchdown, win and loss. Then came word of the unanimous vote among the league’s chancellors and presidents to play football, reversing a decision made in August to postpone the season. They insist that their daily testing protocols for people within football programs are sufficient to control the virus. And they have established thresholds for when a team must stop practicing or competing, and students who test positive will be barred from playing for at least 21 days. Schools are also barring fans and on-campus tailgates. The Big Ten’s plan, though, is focused on players, coaches and others affiliated with athletics — a reflection of what university officials often believe is the proper role for a sports league — not the wider student body, much less the wider community. At Northwestern University, near Chicago, the athletic director offered little in the way of explanation when a reporter from The Daily Northwestern asked this week what he would tell students who would not receive the same level of testing as their peers on the football team. In Madison, Wis., where the denizens of the state capital ordinarily coexist happily with the University of Wisconsin, local politicians and public health officials were unsparing in their assessments of the season’s potential consequences. They worried less about matters like testing access and more over how football could lead to new outbreaks; local health officials said Wednesday that 42 people directly tied to Wisconsin’s football program had tested positive for the virus in recent months. “While we all love our football Saturdays, the festivities that come with them are going to serve as new spreading events within our community,” County Executive Joe Parisi of Dane County said in a statement. Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway of Madison added: “The increase in cases we are seeing is predominantly due to parties. Adding football parties into this mix is only going to make the situation worse.” Updated Sept. 17, 2020 Here’s what’s happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to life:
