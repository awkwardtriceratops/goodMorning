By Ben Smith David J. Pecker, the tabloid media titan who drew the scrutiny of federal investigators for his alleged role in Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, is out as the leader of the parent company of The National Enquirer, Us Weekly and other publications, according to a company announcement on Friday. At the same time, American Media, the company led by Mr. Pecker since 1999, has been renamed A360Media, according to the announcement, which was circulated internally Friday afternoon by David Parry, the chief executive of Accelerate 360, a company that is being merged with American Media. Both are controlled by the hedge fund Chatham Asset Management. Accelerate 360 describes itself as a logistics company that delivers products from “from corkscrews to umbrellas” and has recently promoted its deliveries of protective face masks and hand sanitizer. Under Mr. Pecker, 68, The Enquirer moved away from its usual coverage of Hollywood celebrities and reality television stars to bolster the candidacy of Mr. Trump and attack his political foes, including Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton. In 2016, Mr. Pecker and his associates helped orchestrate deals involving two women who claimed past affairs with Mr. Trump: the former Playboy model Karen McDougal and the porn star Stormy Daniels. In a piece of tabloid tradecraft known as “catch and kill,” the articles were never published.
