Kessel WASHINGTON — When the publication of a dossier of unproven rumors about Donald J. Trump and Russia rocked American politics in early 2017, one salacious claim jumped out: Russia intelligence services supposedly had a video showing Mr. Trump cavorting with prostitutes in Moscow’s Ritz-Carlton hotel. Mr. Trump denied it all, no evidence emerged supporting the existence of any tape, and other claims in the so-called Steele dossier were disproved. But talk of a purported tape became a lingering touchstone of an era awash in conspiracy theories and misinformation — tantalizing Mr. Trump’s critics and enraging his supporters. The claim came from Igor Danchenko, a Russia analyst who gathered leads about possible Trump-Russia links for what turned out to be Democratic-funded opposition research. In an interview, Mr. Danchenko described hearing rumors from two sources about a possible sex tape involving Mr. Trump and the Ritz-Carlton, then obtaining more nebulous information from two hotel employees he took as corroborative. Acknowledging that the material was too thin to amount to proof and saying that he himself remained skeptical, Mr. Danchenko defended the integrity of his work. He said he was assigned simply to gather “raw intelligence” for his employer, Christopher Steele, and passed along claims that raised a potential “red flag.” He noted that he was not responsible for how Mr. Steele portrayed that information in the dossier, nor for making it public. “Even raw intelligence from credible sources, I take it with a grain of salt,” Mr. Danchenko said. “Who knows, what if it’s not particularly accurate? Is it just a rumor or is there more to it?” Mr. Danchenko said he wanted to clear his name after his identity was revealed in July. Threats and harassment followed, he said, escalating when Attorney General William P. Barr declassified the fact that Mr. Danchenko was himself scrutinized in a counterintelligence investigation a decade ago. The F.B.I. closed it in 2011 without charging him, but Mr. Trump’s allies, like Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, began calling him a “Russian agent.” Mr. Danchenko — who made his name as a Russia analyst by exposing indications that the dissertation of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia contained plagiarized material — accused the senator of smearing him. “I’ve never been a Russian agent,” Mr. Danchenko said. “It is ridiculous to suggest that. This, I think, it’s slander.” After Mr. Danchenko’s lawyer, Mark Schamel, sent letters to Mr. Graham and Republicans, demanding that they stop calling his client a “Russian agent,” Mr. Graham denied that he had made false statements. He added that as a public official, he is legally immune from defamation lawsuits. “I have done nothing more than simply relay these matters of intense public interest to the American people,” Mr. Graham wrote. Mr. Danchenko, 42, was born in Russia and lives in the United States. Mr. Steele, a former British intelligence agent who founded a business intelligence firm, hired him in the spring of 2016 to hunt for links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr. Steele’s efforts were part of opposition research that Democrats were indirectly funding by the time the 2016 general election took shape. Mr. Danchenko said he did not know who Mr. Steele’s client was at the time and considered himself a nonpartisan analyst and researcher. In June 2016, Mr. Danchenko met with several people — whom he declined to identify, citing their security — in Moscow and St. Petersburg. He said he casually steered conversations toward whether they had heard anything compromising about Mr. Trump. One of them, he said, first mentioned the rumor about the tape. The essence of the rumor is that Mr. Trump in 2013 booked the Moscow Ritz-Carlton’s presidential suite, where former President Barack Obama had stayed in 2009. The story was that Russian intelligence had wired the room to gather blackmail material on visitors — and that Mr. Trump hired prostitutes whom he instructed to urinate on each other and the bed where Mr. Obama had slept. Mr. Danchenko said the contact told him that Mr. Trump was “well known” to Russian security services and seemed surprised he had not already heard about the purported Ritz-Carlton matter. A second contact also independently brought up a compromising video of Mr. Trump of a sexual nature that may have been covertly filmed at the Ritz-Carlton. However, that person did not mention urination, according to Mr. Danchenko.
