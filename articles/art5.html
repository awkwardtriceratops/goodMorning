By Rachel L. Harris and Lisa Tarchak Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants. For those working in the restaurant industry, “Every day is a negotiation: of labor costs, food costs, rent, insurance, health inspections, and the art and craft of creating an experience special enough to keep people coming through the doors,” writes Priya Krishna in her Op-Ed, “How to Save Restaurants.” The pandemic raised the stakes of that balancing act. Safety restrictions and lockdowns have put even more pressure on the industry’s already-shaky economic models, pushing staff and owners to the edge — physically, mentally and financially. The trickling return of indoor dining across the country — including in New York this week — may offer restaurants some relief. But will that extend to workers? Can restaurant owners weather the pandemic’s long-term effects? We reached out to people working in restaurants around the country to see how their lives and livelihoods have changed since the coronavirus. “We’re punching above our weight so far and keeping everyone employed,” writes Robert Hoover, whose restaurant in Stowe, Vt., was able to continue service by setting up picnic tables on its large front lawn. But, he says, “winter will bring a very different economic story, and not just here.” More accounts from restaurant workers follow. They have been edited for length and clarity. The pandemic drilled in the message that our restaurant was dedicated to profits, not people. We did not close for a single day, and we were not provided with P.P.E. until July. There was no pandemic pay, no offer of financial assistance, no specific rules in place for shutting down if one of us tested positive. Yet our owner did not step foot into the restaurant for almost four months out of self concern. I ended up leaving. — Aubrey Schefft, 26, Cleveland Heights, Ohio I have an advanced degree, and I’ve worked in hospitality my entire life as a choice. Now I am unmoored, searching for what’s next. I no longer want to work in a field that is so broken. I want health insurance, a 401(k) and a fair wage, and I want to know the people that work with me have job security and are also being treated and paid fairly. It’s pathetic that these asks are so far-fetched in today’s climate, and I have decided I can’t keep subjecting myself to this. I don’t know what’s next but after working in a field I love for 20 years, I have to move on. — Elizabeth Kelso, 34, Los Angeles I quit in March. I was expected to work and endanger my health (and my family’s) for far less money. I refused and so was not able to collect unemployment. Broke, unemployed and terrified, I’m scared for my future with no financial security to speak of. I want out of the industry but jobs are scarce. — Ryan Robertson, 43, Colorado I’m a sommelier and bar manager at a fine-dining restaurant in Hawaii and part of a management team driving the restaurant’s adaptation. I now spend very little time tableside and more time getting promotions like wine discounts onto Instagram. Like so many others in this state, we lost a major source of revenue when travel shut down. We reopened Aug. 6 at 50 percent capacity, which so far has yielded about 25 percent of pre-Covid revenue. The Paycheck Protection Program money makes this sustainable for one more month. And even if a new round of P.P.P. doesn’t come through, we’ve decided to forge ahead.
