City Council Votes to Expel One of Its Own for 1st Time in Memory<br></h1><p id="artcont">Andy King, a Bronx Democrat, was voted out after facing three ethics inquiries. By Emma G. Fitzsimmons A New York City councilman once made a female staff member uncomfortable by holding her hand for too long and asking her to wear a beautiful gown to a fund-raising gala. He told another staff member, who had to go to the emergency room for menstrual bleeding, to “put a Band-Aid on it.” And he was accused of pocketing $2,000 in cash from a payout to a third staff member and refusing to pay a $15,000 fine imposed by the City Council. The councilman, Andy King, a Democrat from the Bronx, has long been accused of misbehavior, leading to three ethics investigations by the Council. He finally lost his job on Monday. The City Council voted to oust Mr. King in a stunning rebuke that was believed to be the first time in the city’s history that a Council member was expelled in a vote by colleagues. “Councilman King’s behavior is unfixable,” Corey Johnson, the Council speaker, said at a video hearing held over Zoom. The Council’s ethics committee found last week that the latest allegations against Mr. King were substantiated and recommended his expulsion. The vote was 48-2, with one of the no votes cast by Mr. King. Several Council members expressed regret that they had not removed him sooner. “I’ve heard no contrition from Councilman King at all, ever, for any of his conduct,” said Costa Constantinides, a councilman from Queens. Mr. King offered a lengthy defense during the hearing, arguing that he was targeted by investigators for political reasons and because he is a Black man. He said the Council had never expelled someone for behavior that was not a crime. “I ask us not to be the Council that does that,” Mr. King said.
