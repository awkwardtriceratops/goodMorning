Democrats’ Showing<br></h1><p id="artcont">Supported by New York State Republicans used images of boarded-up businesses and of Mayor Bill de Blasio to persuade voters to vote for their candidates. By Jesse McKinley, Dana Rubinstein and Emma G. Fitzsimmons ALBANY, N.Y. — With Democrats facing the loss of at least one congressional seat in New York and several state senators imperiled on Long Island, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the state’s top Democrat, found a familiar scapegoat: Mayor Bill de Blasio. “They ran de Blasio’s picture all over the state,” the governor said in an interview on Thursday, noting that the city was depicted as a place of “looting, and crime and homelessness.” “That was their message, and it resonated more than it should have,” he said on WAMC radio, adding, “It shouldn’t have been this close.” Mr. Cuomo, like many Democratic leaders in New York, cautioned that many thousands of absentee ballots were still to be counted, and he scolded Republicans for prematurely claiming victory in several closely watched races. But the governor’s comments offered a first glimpse at potential strains among New York Democrats as their senior leaders wrestle with anxiety over the results of Tuesday’s election. Some officials, like Mr. Cuomo, are already at the finger-pointing stage. The mayor has certainly become a reliably powerful tool for Republican candidates looking for moderate suburban and rural votes. This election cycle they invoked Mr. de Blasio to suggest that Democrats were weak on crime and fond of high taxes. As such they echoed national attacks from Republicans on figures like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow Democrat and progressive from the city. “They used Bill de Blasio and A.O.C. as their villains,” said Jay Jacobs, the chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee and a close ally of Mr. Cuomo’s. He added that voters saw images like “major stores on Fifth Avenue being boarded up” the day before Election Day. “It created unease and fed the Republican law-and-order narrative.” The mayor was not the only Republican target; candidates also attacked the governor, as well as Democratic legislative leaders. Mr. de Blasio, when told of the governor’s comments, brushed them off and played down the Republicans’ successes. “I think whatever the Republicans did was pretty modest, honestly,” he said.
