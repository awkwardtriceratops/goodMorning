By Jennifer Finney Boylan Contributing Opinion Writer The president was showing his successor around the White House when suddenly he burst into tears. “I’m a one-termer!” George H.W. Bush sobbed. “I’m a Jimmy Carter!” Actually this was the great Dana Carvey doing his Bush 41 imitation on “Saturday Night Live” in November 1992. It was just a few weeks after the election, and Mr. Bush, of course, had lost to Bill Clinton. A second term? “Not gonna do it. Wouldn’t be prudent.” Bush 41 was the most recent president to serve but a single term. We tend to think of this as a rarity in American politics, but for most of our nation’s history, one term — or less than two full ones — has been the rule, rather than the exception. Of the 44 men who have served as president, only 14 have completed two terms. (And I’d make the case that it’s really 13, since Woodrow Wilson was largely incapacitated during his final year in office, after his stroke in October 1919.) If Donald Trump loses his bid for re-election in November, he’ll join the one-termers club. And then he’ll have to consider what his mission will be in the years remaining. Should this come to pass, history provides some good — if varied — examples of the ways ex-presidents can continue to serve. More on that in a second. But first, let us consider how unusual it is that four of our past five presidents — Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama — completed two full terms. This has happened only once before: at the founding, when George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe all did it. (Of the first five presidents, only John Adams, in 1800, failed to win re-election.) In fact, there’s a nearly 100-year stretch — from 1837 to 1933 — when only two men served two full terms: Ulysses S. Grant and Woodrow Wilson. (And again, I’d consider the post-1919 Wilson president in name only, as others — including his wife, Edith — determined his agenda.) In all, 23 men served as president during those years, including Grover Cleveland, who served nonconsecutive terms. Wilson and Grant were re-elected and lived to see their successors inaugurated. What happened to the others? Well, five were denied their party’s nomination for a second term: John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, Andrew Johnson and Chester Arthur. Five more — Martin Van Buren, Grover Cleveland (in 1888), Benjamin Harrison, William Howard Taft and Herbert Hoover — gained the nomination, only to be defeated in the general election. Six others died in office: William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, William McKinley and Warren Harding. Of the six, three — Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley — were assassinated. And five more simply chose not to run for a second full term: James Polk, James Buchanan, Rutherford Hayes, Theodore Roosevelt (in 1908) and Calvin Coolidge. Cleveland also opted out of another run in 1896; apparently two terms, even if not consecutive, were enough. (He did wind up getting his picture on the $1,000 bill, though, which, as my mother used to say, is not nothing.)
