By Elisabetta Povoledo ROME — The Vatican has confirmed the pope’s remarks on gay couples deserving civil protections as it sent an explanatory note to bishops underlining that Francis’s comments did not mark a change in church doctrine. The pope’s remarks made headlines last month after they appeared in the documentary “Francesco,” at its Oct. 21 premiere at the Rome Film Festival. In the documentary, he reiterated his view that gay people are “children of God,” and said: “What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered.” Last week, acknowledging the “various reactions and interpretations” provoked by the pope’s apparent break from his predecessors, the Vatican Secretary of State sent an explanatory note to its nuncios, or ambassadors, to be shared with bishops, “with the desire to favor an appropriate understanding of the words of the Holy Father.” The apostolic nuncio to Mexico, the Reverend Franco Coppola, published the unsigned note on his Facebook page on Saturday. On Monday, a Vatican official confirmed its authenticity. The note says that during a 2019 interview, the pope had answered two separate questions — asked at different moments — that in the documentary were “edited and published as a single answer without proper contextualization, which has led to confusion.” The director of the film, Evgeny Afineevsky, had told reporters that the pope had made the comments on civil unions directly to him, but it emerged soon after that the comments had apparently been made in a 2019 interview with the Mexican broadcaster Televisa. The pope’s comments on civil unions had been cut from that interview, but it remains unclear under whose orders the snipping took place. In its explanatory note, the Vatican said Francis’ comments on civil union referred to a position he had taken when he had been archbishop of Buenos Aires and had strongly opposed a 2010 law allowing same-sex marriage. Argentina was the first country in Latin America to legalize same-sex marriage.
