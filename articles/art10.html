School Buildings Have Already Reported a Positive Case<br></h1><p id="artcont">Nearly all the buildings remained open, following city guidelines that say only those schools with two cases in different classrooms will shut. By Sharon Otterman At least one coronavirus case had been reported in more than 100 school buildings and early childhood centers in the New York City school system by the first day of in-person instruction on Monday, according to the Department of Education. Nearly all the buildings remained open, though six were closed temporarily, in accordance with city guidelines that only those schools that report at least two cases in different classrooms will be shut. The cases occurred between Sept. 8, when teachers and staff reported to schools, and Monday, when the first students entered classrooms. In dozens of cases, the infected individuals got the positive test results and did not report to work, the department said. Others did report to school, and their close contacts in the buildings had to quarantine for two weeks. Avery Cohen, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said the cases included a “handful” of students, but that “the vast majority” were among staff before schools reopened for students. Cases were reported at 11 additional schools and two community-based prekindergartens on Tuesday. Some public health experts said the statistics reflect a new reality of in-person learning during a pandemic in a system of 1.1 million schoolchildren, 75,000 teachers and 2,500 school buildings and early childhood centers. Daily positive cases will be inevitable, and individual building closings will be a common occurrence, they said. Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the city’s families should be prepared for a constant game of “Whac-a-Mole.” The virus is likely to re-emerge repeatedly in school buildings until there is either a vaccine or very frequent testing, he said. Ideally, 50 percent of all students and staff should be tested three times a week, Dr. Mina said.
