Imagine what he could do with four more years. By Alexander Vindman and John Gans Lt. Col. Vindman served on the National Security Council. Mr. Gans is the author of “White House Warriors,” a history of the council. A year ago, the world read a record of a phone call in which President Trump pressured Ukraine’s government to provide dirt on his political rival, Joe Biden. The transcript of that call, along with other evidence, made clear the president and his associates asked officials in Kyiv to deliver on Mr. Trump’s political interests in exchange for American military aid needed to defend Ukraine. At the end of last year, the president was impeached for that abuse of power. This was not a unique instance of Mr. Trump’s personal priorities corrupting American foreign policy. As the 2020 election grew closer, the president increasingly ignored the policies developed by his own government and instead pursued transactions guided by self-interest and instinct. The result is a patchwork of formal policies and informal deals that has undermined America’s interests and credibility. But Mr. Trump’s sloppy management matters less than its result: No one can trust American foreign policy right now. Unfortunately, trust is the coin of the realm in national security. One of us, Lt. Col. Vindman, served in the military for more than two decades, including 19 months on Mr. Trump’s national security staff; the other, Mr. Gans, served at the Pentagon and wrote a book on how presidents from Harry Truman to Mr. Trump have made national security decisions. We know what it’s like to try to give advice and to be charged with carrying out policy. And we’ve both seen — in history and in recent years — what happens when decision-making becomes erratic and institutions break down.
