These Brand-New New Yorkers Don’t Think So<br></h1><p id="artcont">Thousands of Americans move to New York each year, many of them seeking a fresh start. Even a pandemic couldn’t totally stop that. By Jazmine Hughes Victoria Gruenert went through a sudden, ugly breakup this past spring, so she did what many 20-somethings have done before her: She picked up her things and moved to New York City, eager for a fresh start. But the city she had pictured in her head — a high-paced office life, a jam-packed social calendar, the bustling Manhattan she’d seen on TV — was gone. Ms. Gruenert forged ahead, despite reports that scores of spooked residents had skipped town. New York had become a global epicenter of the virus, but new transplants like her were determined to make the city home. “Very few people empathized,” Ms. Gruenert said. “But there will never be a perfect time to do it, so we might as well just brace ourselves, and go right through this, and see how we come out on the other end.” Every year, just over 150,000 Americans move to the five boroughs, according to the Department of City Planning. While the city doesn’t track when new residents arrive, double-parked moving trucks and wedged-open building doors are as endemic to warm New York weather as the jingle of an ice cream truck or the illicit thrill of a nutcracker.
