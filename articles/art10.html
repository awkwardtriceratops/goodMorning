They’re the pastry form we need in 2020. By Tamar Adler Ms. Adler is a food writer. After six months at home, I have no idea what I sound like on the page anymore. I’ve lost my voice to underuse — or that’s what it feels like. I don’t know what I look like either. It’s not that I’m sitting around in my pajamas. I’m getting as dressed as I ever did, even putting on perfume. But without daily immersion in society, my sense of the world’s outside-in gaze on me has attenuated. What has remained is the inside out. A stronger-than-usual engine whirs inside me, as if after a few months of fruitlessly seeking absent feedback, flailing around for ways to be perceived, my ego has become less restless, learned to nap. All of this makes me think of galettes. “Galette” is a rough, broad category that refers to any flat or round pastry made of a starch. The word’s presumed origin is the Norman “gale,” meaning “a kind of flat cake.” In Brittany, a galette is a buckwheat crepe; in January, to celebrate Epiphany, there’s galette des rois, a round flattish cake with a charm hidden inside. The galettes that I’m currently thinking of, though — the ones I’ve even found myself rolling out lately — are a sort of free-form pie, usually filled with fruit or sometimes vegetables. (In Italy, the same pastry is called a crostata.) They’re just dough and filling. They’re not aiming at anything; they have no architectural designs — or mine don’t, anyway. I’ve seen arrestingly beautiful galettes on Instagram, which I associate with that cultivated rusticity that can be so grating and so innocent at once, but my galettes are actually simple, really spare — just dough and filling. If it applied here, they might even be called ugly. Of course, it feels frivolous writing or even thinking about galettes right now, amid wildfires, state violence, and a precipitous and ever-worsening pandemic. It is undeniably frivolous. Yet, it’s also true that amid wildfires, state violence and a pandemic, people other than me have been thinking about and making galettes. And this has made me hopeful. I’m not dreaming this up just to manufacture myself company. Kara Nielsen, trend forecaster at WGSN, a London-based forecasting company, affirmed and traced the galette’s recent rise in the United States for me over the phone. She looked over WGSN’s social media map of 2,000 influencers and found galettes springing up and spreading like spores. On April 21 The Feedfeed put out a popular vegan galette on its Instagram that was liked by nearly 15,000 people; 22,000 people liked Smitten Kitchen’s “Any Kind of Fruit Galette” in May. Over the past year, tens of thousands have clicked on Bon Appétit’s collection of 15 galettes; particularly popular is one made of tomatoes. There are three galette recipes on Valery Thomas’s popular blog FoodieinNewYork. We tracked galettes on Google Trends, too, where searches for them have surged, building to this summer’s spike of four times as many “galette” searches as there were in 2004. Ms. Nielsen had made an apricot galette the day before we spoke. Today, social media is both effect and cause; its nature as an amplifier means when you look to it for evidence of a phenomenon, you’re also looking at what is driving the phenomenon. Galette posts, in other words, get people baking galettes. But I think there’s something else going on too.
