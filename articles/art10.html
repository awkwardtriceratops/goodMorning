He was 83. His wife, Robin Love, said the cause was Lewy body dementia. Mr. Cobb, a self-taught designer who worked largely behind the scenes, advanced an aesthetic that still influences the spaceships and time machines of today’s science fiction films: futuristic, yet retro; modular, but boundless; and bursting with meticulous detail. “He was hugely influential to myself and many of my peers in the business,” said François Audouy, the production designer behind the 2019 movie “Ford v Ferrari” and the forthcoming “Ghostbusters: Afterlife.” “His drawings were so infused with logic and realism,” Mr. Audouy said. “It just felt like his spaceships could take off at any moment.” Jim Bissell, a longtime friend of Mr. Cobb’s who was the production designer on movies including “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” (1982) and “Jumanji” (1995), said: “Ron was such an exuberant fellow. He had a curiosity about everything. Despite the fact that he had just a high school education, he was one of the smartest guys I knew.” Ronald Ray Cobb was born in Los Angeles on Sept. 21, 1937, to Robert and Helen Cobb. He graduated from Burbank High School in 1955 and did some animation work for Walt Disney Studios, according to his website, along with a series of odd jobs. Mr. Cobb served with the Army Signal Corps, going to Vietnam in 1963, before he returned to California and began submitting political cartoons to The Los Angeles Free Press, an underground newspaper, in the mid-1960s. Those cartoons, which were syndicated globally, tackled themes that included militarization, racism and nuclear annihilation.  He also created several covers for Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine, as well as the cover of the Jefferson Airplane album “After Bathing at Baxter’s.” Mr. Cobb’s work earned him an invitation from Ms. Love, then a member of the Australian Union of Students, to tour in Australia. The two met on that tour, married in 1973 and moved to Los Angeles. Ms. Love said that she bought a small restaurant and supported the two of them for their first few years back in the United States.
