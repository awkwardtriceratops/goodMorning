By Johnny Diaz Two fast-moving wildfires, having burned more than 18,000 acres in Northern California since they began on Sunday, prompted new evacuation orders as the year’s grueling fire season wore on, the authorities said. The Zogg Fire in Shasta County and the Glass Fire in Napa County burned about 7,000 and 11,000 acres as of Monday morning, according to the state fire agency, Cal Fire. In nearby Sonoma County, where fires were burning uncontained on Sunday night, there were at least nine evacuation zones. On Monday morning, Cal Fire said that there was an “immediate threat to life” in some areas, and that the authorities in Napa and Sonoma had opened evacuation centers. The Napa County Sheriff’s Office also warned people to “evacuate immediately.” On Twitter on Sunday night, the office shared a video of a deputy evacuating as fires incinerated trees, embers flew into the air and smoke enveloped a roadway. The new burst of fires comes as the West Coast struggles to recover from one of the worst seasons on record. Wildfires this year have left more than 25 people dead, destroyed more than 7,000 structures, and scorched more than five million acres in California, Oregon and Washington. State leaders and experts have linked the devastating fire season to climate change, saying it is part of a long-term trend of more frequent and disastrous blazes in the West. And meteorologists warned of more fire-prone conditions this week, after repeated heat waves and weeks of windy weather this summer. On Monday morning, Cal Fire said two additional fires that started Sunday night had already merged with the Glass Fire.
