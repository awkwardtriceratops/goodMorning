But his financial record raises questions. By Danny Hakim Tommy Tuberville, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama, is running in large measure on his experience in college football’s Southeastern Conference, known as the S.E.C., where he coached Auburn University. But he has had experience with another S.E.C., the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other financial regulators. A review by The New York Times found that Mr. Tuberville, who is leading Senator Doug Jones in the polls, has a history of involvement with at least three people who were later convicted of financial fraud in what were described as Ponzi schemes. Mr. Tuberville was largely seen as a victim and was never charged with a crime. In two episodes, Mr. Tuberville lost millions of dollars. A third was more minor, when Mr. Tuberville and his wife, Suzanne, bought a home through a company created by a lawyer who was later convicted of running a real estate-related Ponzi scheme. The Times review included a small charitable foundation created by Mr. Tuberville, finding that its tax records indicated that less than a third of its proceeds went to the veterans’ causes it was set up to advance. The foundation also had bookkeeping issues. The review raised questions about Mr. Tuberville’s judgment and financial acumen. While he has said on the campaign trail that he hoped to serve on the “banking finance” committee — the Senate has separate, and prestigious, banking and finance committees — he has at times undercut his own qualifications. In regards to an ill-fated hedge fund venture, he once told a reporter, “I’m not smart enough to understand all the numbers.” In a statement, Paul Shashy, Mr. Tuberville’s campaign manager, largely deflected questions about Mr. Tuberville’s financial dealings. “Doug Jones, Chuck Schumer, and other liberal, Swamp Democrats are spreading lies in an attempt to smear Coach Tuberville’s career, accomplishments, and charitable service,” Mr. Shashy said, adding, “Coach is focused solely upon serving his fellow Alabamians and faithfully representing their conservative values, beliefs, and desires.” The Times previously reported on one fraudulent scheme in which Mr. Tuberville was an investor and a 50/50 owner of a financial firm, TS Capital, that was shut down by state and federal regulators. A 2012 complaint from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said that Mr. Tuberville’s partner, John David Stroud, had trading losses of nearly $1.2 million and misappropriated nearly $2.3 million for “car payments, travel expenses, entertainment and retail purchases.” As one of Mr. Stroud’s lieutenants put it, according to court filings, the firm had “the optics of a Ponzi scheme.” Mr. Tuberville has portrayed himself as an unwitting victim of the financial firm. But he made introductions to investors, was kept in the loop on hiring decisions and traveled to New York with Mr. Stroud to meet potential brokers. Mr. Stroud was eventually sentenced to a decade in prison, and Mr. Tuberville lost more than $2 million, including his investment, legal fees and the cost of settling a lawsuit from investors. Victor L. Hayslip, a former lawyer who represented Mr. Tuberville then, has said of him, “Being naïve is not a crime.” But TS Capital — short for Tuberville and Stroud — was not the only questionable investment opportunity. Mr. Tuberville also invested in GLC Enterprises, which the S.E.C. called “an $80 million Ponzi scheme.” GLC was run by Jim Donnan, a former football coach at the University of Georgia, and a partner named Gregory Crabtree. The business ensnared several coaches and former players before it was closed in 2011. Mr. Tuberville invested $1.9 million, and lost about $150,000, a person with knowledge of his investments said. “Jim was the recruiter,” Mr. Tuberville said, referring to Mr. Donnan, in a comment to ESPN at the time the scheme was revealed. “I think Jim was a little like the rest of us. He thought it was going to be a good deal and it just went bad.” Mr. Donnan was eventually acquitted but his partner, Mr. Crabtree, was sentenced to five years in prison and had to pay back more than $20 million. Real estate records reviewed by The Times revealed a third transaction in which Mr. Tuberville had business dealings with an individual who later pleaded guilty to fraud.
