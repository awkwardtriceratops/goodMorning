By Christine Hauser Rush Limbaugh, the conservative talk radio host, said on his show on Monday that his lung cancer had grown worse and was “going in the wrong direction” despite treatment. “It’s tough to realize that the days where I do not think I’m under a death sentence are over,” he said, according to the transcript from his show. Mr. Limbaugh, 69, first told his listeners in February that he had advanced lung cancer and that he had noticed some shortness of breath. He said he would continue working, aside from taking a few days off to undergo testing and determine a treatment plan. But on Monday, he said he wanted to update his listeners on his health and how the disease was affecting it, saying the ups and downs were like “a roller coaster at times that you can’t get off of.” “And at some point you can decide, you know, this medication may be working, but I hate the way I feel every day. I’m not there yet,” Mr. Limbaugh said. “But it is part and parcel of this.” He said he underwent a treatment about two weeks ago that showed “some progression of cancer.” Before that, scans had shown “we had stopped the growth,” he said. “It had been reduced, and it had become manageable.” He said of the “recent progression” of the disease: “It’s not dramatic, but it is the wrong direction.” “The Rush Limbaugh Show” is broadcast every weekday from noon to 3 p.m. The show is a top-rated program on Premiere Radio Networks, a subsidiary of iHeartMedia. It debuted in 1988 and is popular among grass-roots conservatives.
