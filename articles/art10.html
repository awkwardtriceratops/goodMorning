What Are the Best Precautions When Traveling by Car?<br></h1><p id="artcont">TRIPPED UP Our columnist answers your coronavirus-related questions about health and safety on road trips. By Sarah Firshein I am 78 and my wife is 76; we’re both in good health. We are planning to drive from Chicago to Santa Monica before Thanksgiving. We are concerned about how to handle hotels, meals, bathrooms and gas stops during the pandemic. How can we stay safe? Paul Travel is complicated right now, and tasks that seemed simple a year ago — like checking into a hotel or gassing up — suddenly feel like a huge lift.  Americans are expected to take nearly 700 million trips by car this summer, and I have no doubt that many of them share some of your uncertainty. To help answer your road trip questions, I spoke to two public health experts: Sandra Albrecht, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health, and Sarah Fortune, the chair of the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Dr. Fortune just finished a round-trip drive from Boston to New Orleans. The first tip both of these experts offered? Accepting the fact that there is some risk in everything right now. “If you’re going to travel outside your house, you’re never going to get the risk to zero,” said Dr. Albrecht, who is also the chief epidemiologist behind “Dear Pandemic,” a scientific communication effort on social media. “That said, you can travel — you can enjoy your life. But you should also engage in smart behaviors and strategies.” STAYING AT A HOTEL Robot cleaners and U.V. lights are snazzy-sounding talking points, but there’s a better question to ask about a hotel’s cleaning protocols: How long has the room been unoccupied? “We’re still trying to understand how much of the virus lingers in the air, but three days is now generally accepted as a good buffer,” Dr. Albrecht said. “Even if you don’t clean every nook and cranny of a particular hotel room, that’s a good amount of time to reasonably assume that the virus has died off.” If a hotel agent (or vacation-rental owner) can’t answer that question, “it would raise a red flag,” she said. Common spaces like pools and restaurants are closed in many hotels. To further minimize interaction with strangers, Dr. Albrecht suggested checking in and out at off-hours — an industry trend that had already been on the rise pre-pandemic. GRABBING A MEAL The health experts I spoke with agreed that outdoor dining is preferred to indoor dining. “We’re still learning about indoor transmission, but regardless, most of us are not going to research the air quality or air circulation specifics of a particular restaurant,” Dr. Albrecht said. Dr. Fortune’s experience this summer — where she intended to only eat outside but sometimes encountered no outdoor option or a patio already at capacity — underscored another road trip rule: When plans don’t go as expected, travelers should consider their own risk tolerance. “When you’re on the road you’ve got to eat,” she said. And in November, outdoor dining may not be possible anyway. “If you can actually get your food but eat it wherever it is you’re lodging, that’s what would be ideal,” Dr. Albrecht said. “That way, you’re still contributing to the local economy.”
