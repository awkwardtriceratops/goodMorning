Also: An update on fires; and the Dodgers’ win. By Jill Cowan Good morning. On Tuesday, we sent you a refresher on what’s at stake in some of the key statewide ballot propositions. Today, we have a guide to other contests to watch: District 21: The challenger is David Valadao, a Republican running for office in a part of California that has long been the deep red heart of a blue state. But don’t expect to see Mr. Valadao invoking the president as he wages a tough, personal campaign to win back the Central Valley House seat he narrowly lost in 2018 to Representative T.J. Cox. Instead, Mr. Valadao, a dairy farmer from Hanford, has been portraying himself as a moderate option who can bridge partisan divides, while slamming his opponent as a Bay Area-style liberal who’s out of touch with the needs of constituents in an agricultural economy. Mr. Cox has countered with a bruising campaign tying his challenger to President Trump and the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, the Republican from the neighboring district who has been a reliable supporter of the president. Republicans hope that if Mr. Valadao can retake the district — which favored Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election and is one of the nation’s most heavily Latino — it might show a way forward for a political party whose influence in the state has slid in the past four years. In the March primary, Mr. Valadao led the field with about 50 percent of the vote, while Mr. Cox earned 38.6 percent. But experts say it’s a tossup. District 25: The voters of this suburban district north of Los Angeles have had something of a roller coaster year. The Democratic newcomer Katie Hill won the seat in 2018 as part of the state’s “blue wave.” But her resignation a year ago reopened the field to a wide range of contenders, including Ms. Hill’s predecessor, the Republican Steve Knight, and the progressive talk show host Cenk Uygur, who was at one point endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders before the endorsement was retracted amid an outcry over offensive comments Mr. Uygur had made previously. In a May special election, though, Mike Garcia, a Republican and former military pilot, easily beat Christy Smith, a Democratic member of the State Assembly, making it the first time the G.O.P. has flipped a Democrat-held seat in California since the last millennium. That was just temporary, though. The two are now fighting a rematch, and it’s looking like a tight race. District 48: For years, this coastal Orange County district was dominated by the Republican Dana Rohrabacher, who was closely allied with President Trump and had been called “Putin’s favorite congressman.” In 2018, though, a former Republican from Laguna Beach, Harley Rouda, unseated Mr. Rohrabacher after three decades. This time around, Republicans are pinning their hopes on Michelle Steel, the chair of the powerful Orange County board of supervisors who has served as an adviser to the president on Asian-American issues. Mr. Rouda has blamed Ms. Steel for exacerbating the coronavirus pandemic by undermining the advice of scientists and health experts, and Ms. Steel has accused Mr. Rouda of politicizing a pandemic. District 50: Unlike the aforementioned House races, this district, in San Diego County, never turned blue. Its Republican representative was Duncan Hunter, who resigned in January after he pleaded guilty to charges that he used his campaign coffer to finance a lavish lifestyle. It was the end of a decades-long dynasty in the district; Mr. Hunter succeeded his father. Mr. Hunter’s political vulnerability prompted Darrell Issa, a longtime former Republican congressman, to jump into the race against Ammar Campa-Najjar, the young Democratic challenger Mr. Hunter beat in 2018, despite the charges.

But in California, debates over how to police the police were already well underway. For years, Black Lives Matter activists in Los Angeles have slammed District Attorney Jackie Lacey for failing to prosecute police officers who have killed people on the job. Now, she’s facing a serious challenge from George Gascón, who was until recently San Francisco’s district attorney and has pitched himself as a progressive reformer.
