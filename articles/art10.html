The outpost is the backdrop for a ghost story, and is known for strange voices, radio static and the creeping fear of being watched. By Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Taimoor Shah KABUL, Afghanistan — It seemed the perfect vantage point for the Marines: a 30-foot-high dirt pile overlooking the low-lying poppy fields of Helmand Province. What they could not explain were the strange lights at night, the whispers in the darkness, the mysterious radio static, the sudden chill in a summer breeze and the recurring whiff of corpses. Only later did the Marines and British soldiers stationed there begin to understand the place they called Observation Post Rock. The post and its surrounding area were considered cursed by residents of the Amir Agha villages, an area where the Taliban insurgents now reside following the failed campaigns of the American, Afghan, Soviet and British militaries there. The vacated outpost has cemented itself in both American and local Afghan culture as part of a legend, a peculiar intersection of history, spiritualism and the paranormal. It is the backdrop for a ghost story built along the spine of Afghanistan’s unending wars and its countless dead. The Taliban roam freely now among the clusters of small villages and poppy fields in Helmand’s Garmsir district, all irrigated by a canal system built during the Cold War and funded by the United States. It was different 12 years ago, when the Marines deployed in Garmsir to help drive the Taliban out. The dominant height of what the Marines described as a hardened dirt pile offered the best position for an outpost to see their enemy. Cpl. Andrew Rouser, one of the first Marines assigned to the outpost, simply called it “the Rock.” But before the Marines destroyed what they believed to be a Taliban defensive position on the mound with a demolition charge, Lance Cpl. Brendan Kelly discovered evidence of the hill’s ancient design: small tunnels dug into its base that led to a single chamber — maybe a fort or tomb. “It was creepy,”Corporal Kelly recalled. The blast from the Marine’s explosives collapsed the tunnels. In the months and years that passed, buried human bones were discovered in the Rock as American units rotated in and out of the outpost, and the destruction of Corporal Kelly’s discovery in 2008 morphed into part of its mystique.
