By Edmund Lee Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp is making a play for Simon & Schuster, the venerable home to best-selling authors like Stephen King and Hillary Clinton that raised a ruckus this year after releasing a string of hit titles critical of President Trump. The powerhouse publisher was put up for sale by its owner, ViacomCBS, in March, and the company has since fielded more than half a dozen inquiries, according to three people familiar with the process who declined to be named because the matter remains confidential. In addition to News Corp, which already owns HarperCollins, a leading bidder is Penguin Random House, according to the people. Penguin Random House, the largest book publisher in the United States, is owned by the German media giant Bertelsmann. The French firm Vivendi, a minority owner of Hachette through the publisher Lagardère, has also made a bid. At least one of the offers has topped $1.7 billion, far above the minimum ViacomCBS had set, according to two of the people. Several financial firms, after lobbing offers below that range, are no longer in the running. Final bids are due before Thanksgiving, and ViacomCBS could announce a winner some time after that. A deal may not materialize. ViacomCBS, the newly merged conglomerate led by Shari Redstone, declined to comment. News Corp and Vivendi also had no comment. Bertelsmann would not address Simon & Schuster in particular, but a spokesman said, “We have stated in the past that Penguin Random House wants to grow organically and through M&A.” The Financial Times earlier reported on Bertelsmann’s interest; Publisher’s Weekly was the first to report on HarperCollins’s.
