Now Let’s Go Into Quarantine.<br></h1><p id="artcont">For members of the world’s largest diaspora of adoptees, returning to the country of their birth was a rite of passage — until the coronavirus pandemic changed everything. Some found a way to make the trip anyway. By Bryan Pietsch When a taxi deposited Mallory Guy in front of an apartment building in Cheonan, South Korea, groggy and dazed after a 14-hour flight from Atlanta, a Korean couple was waiting for her on the sidewalk with open arms. It was the first time since she was 7 months old that Ms. Guy, 33, had been in the country where she was born. It was also her first time seeing her birth parents since she was sent to the United States more than three decades ago. They gave her up for adoption when they could not afford the surgery to repair her cleft palate. Ms. Guy, who was adopted by a family in Mentor, Ohio, had taken a 23andMe DNA test in 2013 hoping to find information about her health. She checked the website each year, looking for a potential connection to her Korean family. Late last year, she matched with a relative in Seattle. “Her mom thinks she knows who I am,” she said of her interaction. “If I am who they think, I’m her niece. And they’ve been looking for me.” Around 200,000 Korean children have been sent to families overseas since the 1950s, primarily to white families in America, according to Kelly Condit-Shrestha, a historian in Minneapolis who studies adoption. They are the largest diaspora of adoptees in the world, she said. In recent years, reunions between adoptees and their biological parents have become more common, thanks to the loosening of South Korean privacy laws surrounding adoption, as well as the increased use of social media and genetic testing. For some adoptees, the reunions had become a rite of passage, one they have imagined and anticipated for as long as they can remember, like a wedding or the birth of a child. Then came the pandemic of 2020. The pilgrimages back to South Korea dwindled. Many adoptees canceled long-planned reunions after the government’s quarantine rules for foreign visitors made the trips too costly and time-consuming. But Ms. Guy persisted. Her reunion with her parents would not be a brief chat in a coffee shop. She would be spending 14 days with them in their home. Ms. Guy’s Korean family had been set to visit her in Ohio in March, but the virus derailed their plans. At the end of the summer, she was furloughed from her job at a restaurant. “This is probably the best time to do it,” she recalled thinking. In September, she flew to Korea alone. When Ms. Guy arrived, she did not know whether she would be allowed to spend the two weeks at her biological parents’ home or be forced to stay at a costly government hotel. The South Korean Embassy’s website said only that such decisions were made on a case-by-case basis. At the airport, Ms. Guy, who spoke little Korean, clutched a certificate that proved she was the daughter of a Korean family. Officials called her Korean father to verify her identity. When she hugged her parents outside their apartment in Cheonan, about 50 miles south of Seoul, she was no longer an infant with a cleft palate, but a grown woman with a repaired lip, an American husband and two children of her own. Reunited by a genetic test, an intercontinental flight and a pandemic, Ms. Guy and her parents climbed four stories to the modest three-bedroom apartment where she would spend her first two weeks. The language barrier loomed large. “I panicked a little bit inside,” Ms. Guy said. Her fears were unfounded. They watched Netflix together, laughing at moments that were humorous regardless of language. Her parents made Korean food for her and American snacks like peanut butter and jelly. (They also stocked up on milk, because they had heard that Americans love milk.) They even bought her an exercise bike, as she had told them during calls that she enjoyed using her Peloton. “I didn’t get to feed my daughter for 33 years, so this is the least I could do,” said Lim Mi-soon, 59, her birth mother. “They’ve been more than amazing,” Ms. Guy said in a phone call a few days into her quarantine, adding that she was “thankful I have uninterrupted time with my parents here.” Emotions were flowing as Ms. Guy flipped through a photo album of the family, including Ms. Guy’s Korean siblings, a brother and a sister. “Seeing the pictures of everybody growing up made me miss them more,” she said. Though the tears were mostly a response to seeing “how wonderful they are and what could have been,” Ms. Guy said, her mother was worried that she had upset her by showing her the photos. “It was hard to tell her through the translator that I wasn’t mad,” she said. Ms. Guy’s homecoming was far from normal. Reunions between birth parent and child are often stiff, formal meetings, stifled by a language barrier and the bureaucratic hold of adoption agencies. They often occur at a restaurant or a coffee shop, not unlike a blind date. Intensely emotional conversations — tearful apologies from the parent, for instance, or reassurances from the child — must be filtered through an interpreter.
