By Karen Crouse PARIS — From behind a glass divider with frosted patterns, the French Open players bare their souls to voices seated on the other side. It is Roland Garros’s version of the confessional, and in the first week of the French Open, players paid more than 158 visits to the boxy phosphorescent rooms and fielded more than 1,083 questions, many from reporters on the other side of the divider, as close to the athletes as the baseline is from the net. “It’s obviously a very strange situation,” said Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria, who is seeded 18th. In accordance with coronavirus-induced self-distancing protocols, players’ face-to-face interviews with most reporters have moved online. Like videoconferencing desk workers everywhere, the participants are adjusting to the new normal while gaining a new appreciation for what is lost in the transaction. “I miss you guys,” Dimitrov said on Saturday night as he sat behind a desk and stared at a checkerboard of faces on a flat screen mounted to a post in the middle of an otherwise empty room. Dimitrov, 29, added that he “feeds off” the “vibes” of a full house of reporters, even when the sentiments they express give him pause, as happened last week when a reporter from a remote location confessed that he was jealous of Dimitrov for dating Maria Sharapova and asked if he had kept in touch with her since their 2015 breakup and her 2020 retirement. Dimitrov gracefully volleyed back the wild lob with a playful reply: “You can still be jealous.”
