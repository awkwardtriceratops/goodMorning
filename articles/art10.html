It won’t be easy. By Robert Malley and Philip H. Gordon Mr. Malley and Mr. Gordon served in the Obama administration. Of the countless challenges President-elect Joe Biden will face when he assumes office, few will be as daunting as reversing President Trump’s legacy of bulldozing multilateral institutions, ripping up past international agreements, shattering norms and undermining longstanding alliances. Mr. Biden has vowed to turn the page on the “aberration” of Mr. Trump’s foreign policy. Some Trump-induced changes will easily be reversed, but many will be challenging to unwind, and some are likely to be indelible. Mr. Trump, who has already undermined the international order and isolated the United States, now appears determined to use his final 10 weeks in office to pursue a scorched-earth foreign policy that will only make Mr. Biden’s job harder and leave the world even less stable on Jan. 20. A few words in Mr. Biden’s inaugural speech about his commitment to multilateralism, diplomacy and human rights would set the right tone. On Nov. 4, the Trump administration officially withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement, but Mr. Biden can easily rejoin it on his first day in office, as he has vowed to do. He can prevent our withdrawal from the World Health Organization, which doesn’t take effect until July 2021. The new president can also restore President Barack Obama’s Cuba policy, reaffirm the United States’ commitment to NATO, and replace Mr. Trump’s partisan and often unqualified appointees. But there is only so much low-hanging fruit, not least because the Trump administration has been working relentlessly to make many of these policies as difficult to reverse as possible. Take Iran, where Mr. Biden has made clear his intent to rejoin the 2015 nuclear deal so long as Tehran returns to full compliance. The deal’s revival is precisely what the Trump administration has sought to prevent. It has worked resolutely to build a so-called sanctions wall that would deter businesses from trading with Iran even if the United States rejoined the deal, repackaging nuclear-related sanctions as terrorism-related penalties to make it politically costlier for a Democratic administration to remove them. More broadly, the Trump administration seemed to be trying to erode any Iranian faith that an arrangement entered into with the United States would survive America’s political vicissitudes. A similar logic has been at play on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. President Trump’s proposed peace plan was dead on arrival, drafted without input from the Palestinians and unveiled without any expectation that they would accept it. A workable peace initiative wasn’t Mr. Trump’s objective; his proposal was designed to fundamentally and sustainably alter the starting point of any future peace talks. Imagine a future Israeli negotiator being asked to endorse more traditional terms for a two-state solution, knowing what was once on offer — including the right to annex some 30 percent of the West Bank — and might well be again. Mr. Trump also shifted the terms of the China debate. He has equated his unilateral tariffs with toughness on China and suggested anything less would be surrender — politically complicating Mr. Biden’s task of ending a trade war that has done far more harm than good to American farmers, consumers and taxpayers. And if a Biden administration were to seek to revisit provisions of the agreement reached with the Taliban, by extending the timetable for a full withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, tightening its conditionality or insisting on maintaining a small counterterrorism force, it would have to contend with an Afghan rebel movement that had already been offered a more generous deal and that has grown stronger and less persuaded than ever of America’s staying power. The Taliban won’t be likely to sit idly by if it sees its core demand slip away, even temporarily. There are steps a Biden administration could take to overcome some of these hurdles. If Iran agrees to resume compliance with the nuclear deal, Mr. Biden should be able to rejoin it and repeal the sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, noting that those sanctions were put in place with the political objective of preventing a U.S. return to the deal. Any sanctions on legitimate targets related to terrorism or regional interference could be reimposed. Mr. Biden could employ a similar approach to Mr. Trump’s China trade tariffs. Rather than taking Mr. Trump’s costly and unilateral approach to the trade war as a given, Mr. Biden could initiate a comprehensive review of all tariffs that would include close consultation with American allies on the best way to deal with China. It would result in both better relations with those allies and more leverage to wrest meaningful concessions from Beijing. On Israel, Mr. Biden could state early on that the Trump plan is no longer U.S. policy and restore American assistance to and dialogue with Palestinians, reiterate longstanding — and internationally accepted — views on a viable two-state solution and make plain that his administration would oppose an outcome in which Palestinians were denied equal rights.
