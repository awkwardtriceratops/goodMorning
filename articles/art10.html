By Rob Davidson Dr. Davidson is an emergency room physician. Imagine wanting, needing, to take a gulp of air and finding that you can’t. On Monday, a patient walked into the emergency room where I work. He struggled to breathe as he explained his symptoms to me. When the test result came back positive for the coronavirus, his eyes brimmed, and he spoke quietly: “Will I be OK?” I see some version of this story every day at my hospital in rural west Michigan. It’s some 700 miles away from the White House, and feels even farther as I watch President Trump whisked to the hospital and back in helicopters, and flanked by men in white lab coats, ready to serve him. And yet he tweets, “Don’t be afraid of Covid.” My patients are genuinely afraid. That fear didn’t come from CNN or “fake news.” Nor did it come from Dr. Anthony Fauci. My patients’ fears come from the fact that they can’t breathe. The people who come to my hospital seeking care are largely underserved with underlying conditions. As they struggled and wheezed, they may have thought of their own mortality in the context of the more than 211,000 lives cut short — too many in their prime, healthy one day, dead a week or two later. For nearly 20 years, I’ve had the privilege of serving the same small community and getting to know many of the people who now come to my emergency room. Two-thirds of the voters in our county voted for this president. In my area, many fly his flag and hang on every word he says. Compliance with safety guidelines is thin; most people in our community refuse to wear masks or stay six feet apart. Because social distancing naturally occurs in sparsely populated rural areas, we didn’t see the summertime surge of positive cases like Arizona, Texas and Florida did. But two weeks after our schools resumed in early September, we began to see a spike in Covid-19 cases among children and teenagers. As President Trump urged Americans not to let a highly contagious and lethal disease “dominate” our lives, their parents began showing up in my emergency room, gasping for air. This is the terrible but predictable outcome after the most powerful man in the world told people to “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” and “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!” even when we didn’t have enough masks, tests and contact tracers.
