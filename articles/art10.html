By Jean Hanff Korelitz Ms. Korelitz is a novelist. These poems were composed over the past month from the subject lines of emails from the Trump campaign, mostly sent by “Donald J. Trump” but also from Mike, Don Jr., Eric, Lara, Melania, Newt, Ted Cruz, Official Trump Campaign Store, Trump 2021 Calendar, Official Trump Polling and TRUMP TASK FORCE. What did this liberal Democrat do to get so popular? I filled out a couple of “push polls” (i.e.: “Who do you believe will ALWAYS put America FIRST? President Trump or A Sleazy Democrat”) and ever since the rally in Tulsa, Okla., and the spectacular prank executed by those meddling TikTok kids, I have “registered” for every Trump rally. I tried a few times to unsubscribe, but I still seemed to be constantly bailing out my inbox of MAGA offers. So I decided to make the best of it. Each email subject line appears as a single line of poetry, with no changes in punctuation or capitalization. ARE YOU AWAKE? Are you awake?
