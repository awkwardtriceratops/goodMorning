By Johnny Diaz Two fast-moving wildfires, having burned more than 26,000 acres in Northern California since they began on Sunday, prompted new evacuation orders for thousands of people as the year’s grueling fire season wore on. The Zogg Fire in Shasta County and the Glass Fire in Napa County burned about 15,000 and 11,000 acres as of Monday morning, according to the state fire agency, Cal Fire. In nearby Sonoma County, where fires were burning uncontained on Sunday night, there were at least 11 evacuation zones. On Monday morning, Cal Fire said that there was an “immediate threat to life” in some areas, and that the authorities in Napa and Sonoma had opened evacuation centers. In Napa alone, more than 5,000 people were ordered to evacuate, and 3,000 more were placed under an evacuation warning, said Janet Upton, a spokeswoman for the county.
