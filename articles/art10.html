By Spencer Bokat-Lindell Mr. Bokat-Lindell is a staff editor. This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The 2020 presidential election always promised to be a “historic” one, and there’s no question it delivered: More than 66 percent of the voting-eligible population cast a ballot, according to projections from The Washington Post, the highest level of voter turnout since 1900. As with the 2016 election, the consensus around what this mass expression of popular will says about the country is likely to be debated for years to come, but here are some lessons that journalists, data analysts and politicians are already taking away. The Democratic Party’s goal for this election was a wholesale repudiation of President Trump and his style of politics. But as the Times columnist Jamelle Bouie noted, that repudiation never came. In fact, the president expanded his base in 2020, earning nearly 10 million more votes than he did in 2016 and over six million more than Hillary Clinton. “Even without policy to match the populist persona — the Trump administration has been as generous to the wealthy and connected as it has been stingy with the poor and the working class — Trumpism appeals to tens of millions of voters, from the large majority of white Americans to many people in traditionally Democratic constituencies,” Mr. Bouie writes. “That, if anything, is the surprise of this election.” In a political climate as polarized as ours, much of Mr. Trump’s gains can be chalked up to pure “negative partisanship.” But for people without strong party affiliations, Mr. Trump’s handling of the economy, which voters consistently rank as their top issue, may have played a role: Approval ratings of Mr. Trump’s economic performance remained high throughout his presidency, which coincided with the country’s longest economic expansion. And in September, a majority of Americans told Gallup they were better off than they were four years ago, which was not the case in 2012 and 2004. Of course, Mr. Trump also presided over the sharpest downturn since the Great Depression. But as Annie Lowrey explains in The Atlantic, many Americans seemed not to blame Mr. Trump for the pandemic-induced recession, and the election occurred as the economy was already bouncing back. Because of the trillions in stimulus Congress passed in March, many in the middle class are actually faring better financially than they were before. (Those most devastated by the recession were likely to vote Democratic anyway.) White voters, who made up roughly two-thirds of the electorate, continue to be the only racial group from which Mr. Trump commanded majority support. Exit polls — which, it bears reminding, are preliminary estimates — show that his advantage increased slightly among white women from 2016, but he lost support among white men both with and without college degrees. At the same time, President-elect Joe Biden underperformed Hillary Clinton among other racial and ethnic groups. Mr. Trump expanded his appeal among Black voters, for example, though Black support for Democrats remained so high that the increase in turnout cost Mr. Trump dearly in states such as Michigan and Georgia. Most significant were Mr. Trump’s inroads with Latino voters in the battleground states of Florida and Texas, which helped keep them in Republican hands. In Texas, especially, Mr. Trump’s handling of the economy, combined with the lack of Democratic messaging and outreach, appeared key to his success. But the losses in Latino support Mr. Biden suffered in those states were offset by gains made in others, in part because of grass-roots organizing that preceded this election cycle. In Arizona, for example, the nativist tenure of Joe Arpaio, the former Maricopa County sheriff, galvanized the children of immigrants a decade ago to build political power, which contributed to Mr. Biden’s and Senator-elect Mark Kelly’s victories there.
