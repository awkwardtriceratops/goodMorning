By Lauren Hard In a New Jersey suburb, a woman sets up a tent around 8 p.m. outside a state Motor Vehicle Commission office. She will spend the night there, accompanied by her 4-year-old son, until just before the office opens at 8 a.m. The woman, Sumbal Nadeem, doesn’t need a driver’s license or anything else from the agency. But she does need money. She is being paid $150 to hold a place in line by a motorist who needs a car registration. The pandemic has spawned a new class of worker in New Jersey. They are the line holders or line sitters who, for a fee, will wait for hours, sometimes all night, outside a branch of the Motor Vehicle Commission — which was closed for four months — until whoever hired them comes to take that place right before the office opens. “I’ve been working every day, 12 hours a day,” said Ms. Nadeem, 23, who graduated last December from a community college. She is hoping to become a medical assistant, but has yet to find a job. “I barely get to sleep.” The Motor Vehicle Commission has been overwhelmed by demand since it reopened in early July, after having shut down in March during the state’s coronavirus lockdown.
