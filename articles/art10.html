To the Editor: Re “Iran Struggles for a Response to Bold Strikes” (front page, Nov. 30): I suspect that Israel chose to assassinate a high-level Iranian nuclear scientist with more than tacit approval from the outgoing Trump administration. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, apparently saw what was undoubtedly his last chance to attack Iran, knowing that the incoming Biden administration would have no part in such an action, since Joe Biden wishes to build bridges instead of destroying them. A sad commentary indeed on President Trump and the lengths to which he will go to make it difficult for Mr. Biden to overcome the president’s hateful legacy.
