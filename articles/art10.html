By Michelle Goldberg Opinion Columnist Senator Ed Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who recently warded off a primary challenge from a Kennedy scion, probably saved his career by authoring the Green New Deal resolution with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York last year. When Representative Joe Kennedy, a rising star in the House, entered the Senate race, it looked as if Markey would lose. No Kennedy had ever lost an election in Massachusetts. Markey, who won his seat in a 2013 special election, wasn’t disliked, but he wasn’t particularly well known. A poll last August showed Kennedy ahead by 17 points. In April, The Boston Globe reported that hindered by coronavirus, Markey might have trouble collecting enough signatures to even get on the ballot. As Politico wrote recently, the consensus in Massachusetts political circles was that “Kennedy would be so formidable that Markey ought to retire to avoid an embarrassing defeat.” But the young environmentalists of the Sunrise Movement — who’ve championed the Green New Deal more than any other organization — made saving Markey a major political priority. “Markey was the most prominent figure on the Green New Deal aside from A.O.C.,” said Varshini Prakash, the Sunrise Movement’s executive director. “If he goes down in a Democratic primary, immediately the story that gets spun out of that is, ‘The Green New Deal is a losing political proposition.’” So Sunrise members, in concert with other young progressives, embarked on one of the most successful branding exercises in recent political history, turning a fairly establishment 74-year-old into a youth culture icon. Prakash recalled the thinking of Sunrise’s political team: “We can help make Ed Markey into this figure on the left, this lovable, quirky older guy who kind of has some of the similar characteristics of somebody like Bernie.” The success of this endeavor demonstrates both Sunrise’s growing political power and its pragmatism. In truth, Markey isn’t much like Bernie Sanders at all. He’s a liberal and a longtime leader on climate, but he’s neither an outsider nor a purist; as a member of the House, he voted for the Iraq war and NAFTA. His work on the Green New Deal, however, overshadowed all that. Markey’s reinvention maddened the Kennedy camp. “This goes to show you that the left doesn’t do their homework and they’re easily won over by bright shiny objects,” a Kennedy-aligned source told Politico. Such grousing misses the point. In boosting Markey, Sunrise sent a message to Democrats, especially those in blue states. You don’t need an impeccable record — if you champion the Green New Deal, the movement will have your back. And that support can be priceless. Members of Sunrise did normal campaign stuff for Markey, including, said Prakash, making some 200,000 phone calls. More important, though, was the imaginative energy the movement brought to the race. It helped create an adoring social media following, the so-called Markeyverse, where the senator’s signature green bomber jacket and Nike high-tops were treated as style icons. Sunrise, Markey told me, “knows how to reach people online. And then get them to take action offline.” He called their work “political alchemy.”
