Bryan Cranston, Ricky Gervais, Judge Judy, Kym Whitley and others describe how it feels to face off with Larry David. By Thea Glassman A few years ago, Judge Judy was asked to settle a dispute involving Larry David and a ficus plant. Of course, it wasn’t the real Larry David, but rather his “Curb Your Enthusiasm” alter ego, who was in a custody battle over the aforementioned plant. The individual scenes in “Curb” are largely improvised, which left the judge, who is known offscreen as Judith Sheindlin, to her own devices. “They said, ‘Be you,’ so I was me,” Sheindlin said. “I grabbed Larry’s eyes and said, ‘I don’t want to hear from you again!’ And there was dead silence.” A break was called and David huddled with the show’s director. “He said to him: ‘Larry, what happened? You were supposed to argue with her,’” Sheindlin recalled. “And he said, ‘She frightened me.’” “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” which premiered 20 years ago this week, is known for its deep bench of memorable guest stars, an eclectic mix of celebrity performers, seasoned comedians and big-name acting novices. While David and standbys like Jeff Garlin, Susie Essman and J.B. Smoove form the core of the show, “Curb” has been largely defined by David’s comically contentious interactions with an impressive array of famous people, playing either versions of themselves or characters within the show. The “Curb” approach, in which episodes are outlined but most of the action comes from improvised scenes, can be tricky for performers more accustomed to tightly scripted shows, but over 20 years people like Ben Stiller, Elizabeth Banks and Shaquille O’Neal have signed on to square off with Larry. It wasn’t always that way. Robert B. Weide, a frequent director and a former executive producer of the series, recalled that when “Curb” was starting out, it was hard to get well-known guests to come on the show; Dustin Hoffman, Warren Beatty and Steven Spielberg all passed. Richard Kind, who has gone on to make multiple appearances, didn’t have high hopes before his first episode. In Kind’s debut scene, David finds out that his own mother didn’t want him to know she was dying because she didn’t want to “bother” him. “I said, ‘That’s stupid, who’s going to believe that?’” Kind recalled. “I thought this will never sell.” “Let me tell you something," he added. “I was wrong.”
