By Ruth Graham The board of trustees of Liberty University announced on Monday that it had retained an independent forensic firm to conduct an investigation into the school’s operations under Jerry Falwell Jr., who resigned last week in the wake of a sex scandal after serving as its president and chancellor since 2007. The statement from the board of trustees said the firm would “conduct a thorough investigation into all facets of Liberty University operations during Jerry Falwell Jr.’s tenure as president, including but not limited to financial, real estate and legal matters.” Mr. Falwell had been on leave from the university since Aug. 7, after he posted and then deleted a photograph to Instagram in which he had his pants partially unzipped and his arm around a young woman he later said was his wife’s assistant. He was holding a glass of dark liquid that he joked in the caption was “just black water.” The photo prompted widespread criticism and led to unusually swift action from the evangelical university’s conservative board, handpicked for its loyalty to Mr. Falwell. The board placed Mr. Falwell on indefinite leave and appointed Jerry Prevo, a retired Alaska pastor and chairman of the board, as acting president. Weeks later, a new scandal emerged when a former Miami pool attendant said he had had regular sexual liaisons with Mr. Falwell’s wife, Becki, while Mr. Falwell looked on. The man, Giancarlo Granda, said he met the Falwells in 2012 when he was 20 years old and working at a luxury hotel in Miami Beach.
