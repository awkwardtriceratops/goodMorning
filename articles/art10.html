I Asked Dr. Fauci<br></h1><p id="artcont">In a new interview, he tells us how to survive the coming months, and confesses how stunned he is when people still insist the virus is “fake news.” By Elisabeth Rosenthal Contributing Opinion Writer As a health journalist, a physician and a former foreign correspondent who lived through SARS in Beijing, I often get questions from friends, colleagues and people I don’t even know about how to live during our current pandemic. Do I think it’s safe to plan a real wedding next June? Would I send my kids to school, with appropriate precautions? When will I trust a vaccine?

Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert and a member of the White House task force on the coronavirus.
