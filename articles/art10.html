To the Editor: Re “Key States Up for Grabs as Trump-Biden Battle Extends Late Into Night” (front page, Nov. 4): A blue wave. A landslide victory for Joe Biden. As Election Day came to a close, I quickly came to terms with the reality that neither was going to happen. Perhaps the most devastating reality was that so many Americans really love President Trump. So many of my fellow citizens found his lies, his braggadocio, his handling of the virus, his attack on those who dared to contradict him, his abusiveness totally acceptable, even admirable. Are my values, my morals, my ideals, my respect for my fellow man no longer in vogue? Is my hope for a greener tomorrow out of date? Do Black lives not really matter? Does the Constitution not still uphold freedom and justice? Every presidential election leaves one side questioning its tactics. But this election leaves one side questioning just what America is, what it stands for and what its hopes for tomorrow really are. Doris Fenig
Boca Raton, Fla. To the Editor: In his election night speech, President Trump effectively declared war on American democracy. He baselessly proclaimed victory and falsely asserted that the election was being stolen from him through fraud. He demanded that the counting of votes continue in Arizona, where he trailed, but then said “we want all voting to stop” in the undecided states where he narrowly led at the time, and vowed to go to the Supreme Court to bring that about. In essence, Mr. Trump was demanding that the normal counting of legally and timely cast ballots be selectively halted in states where they could tip the presidential election in favor of Joe Biden. While it is doubtful that he can actually disenfranchise voters as he wishes, his very suggestion and unprincipled rhetoric underscore his lack of respect for the Constitution and for the institutional integrity of our democratic system of government.

San Francisco To the Editor: Polls showing Joe Biden with a sizable lead have again incorrectly predicted the presidential election, which has turned out to be extremely close. That reflects the fact that a large percentage of the American people still doesn’t want high taxes or job-killing government restrictions. Nor do we want open borders or sanctuary cities. Americans support law enforcement and the military and don’t want a socialist government that will lead to bankruptcy and the loss of our freedoms. We don’t want political bias in the media or censorship, and we don’t want to be lectured about social injustice by professional athletes or movie actors. Americans do not want to give up their right to bear arms. We are tired of identity politics and a counterculture movement that strives to destroy our nation. We reject the politicization of everything from pandemics to the rioting and looting in our cities. This populist movement that Donald Trump started four years ago cannot be stopped by a corrupt establishment, and no amount of spin by those who control the information in our nation can stop it. The left will delay the inevitable by dragging out the final outcome for as long as it can, but this revolution goes on for four more years. Charles Michael Sitero
Ormond Beach, Fla. To the Editor: I was surprised but not shocked by Donald Trump’s victory four years ago. Working Americans had been on the losing side of the growing income gap in this country for too long and many were understandably willing to take a chance on the outsider who promised to upend the established order. But I am shocked by the way the 2020 election seems to be turning out. After four years of President Trump’s chaotic rule, I expected him to be clearly rejected by the majority of the voters in favor of the somnolent but stable Democratic alternative. I was wrong. Whatever the final results, one thing is clear from this election: “Red” and “blue” represent more than colors on a political map of the United States. We live in two different countries. John E. Stafford
Rye, N.Y. To the Editor: Regardless of who wins, who can ever trust the polls again? They were shockingly wrong in predicting a winner in 2016, and this year their errors and methodology were supposed to have been examined and corrected. Yet in almost all polls, this was not supposed to be a nail-biter. They gave Joe Biden around a 90 percent chance of victory and predicted a high probability of Democrats retaking the Senate. Mr. Biden may still win, but it would be razor-thin and not remotely what the polls forecast. James Adler
Cambridge, Mass. To the Editor: Re “Feel Inspired, America” (editorial, Nov. 4): Notwithstanding your praise of the voting process, the depressing fact is that about 50 percent of voters in this country were apparently inspired by a president and G.O.P. senators who think it’s just fine to separate babies from mothers and cage them, who deny that humans are responsible for tumultuous weather and have some power to stem that tide, who denigrate those who sometimes risk their lives breathing life into the Constitution’s free press clause, who appoint judges and justices with no courtroom experience but with archconservative leanings, who malign those whose skin color is brown or whose religious beliefs are “different,” who … need I go on? Who cares about process when the substance of policy creates so much pain? I want something different for my year-old granddaughter. I’m urging, pushing, cajoling her parents, my son and daughter-in-law, to raise her elsewhere. Nina Kraut
Washington To the Editor: While all the pundits spout their microanalysis about what motivates voters, the words of Bill Clinton’s campaign manager, James Carville, ring strong and true: “It’s the economy, stupid.” People vote foremost with their pocketbook. President Trump has been smart in repeatedly casting Joe Biden as a socialist. This is an arrow of fear into the minds of swing voters, especially those Latinos in Florida who emigrated from socialist or Communist countries. Mr. Biden has not been forceful or articulate enough in refuting the false assertions and presenting his own economic philosophy. If lies are not refuted immediately and forcefully, fear will trump any political loyalty. Stephen Somerstein
San Francisco To the Editor: Thank heavens for Yuval Levin’s Op-Ed, “No President Can Solve Our Deepest Problems” (Nov. 4). More specifically, thank you for the question, “Given my role here, what should I be doing?” I am a retired high school teacher living in a mostly Republican neighborhood. Today I will bake cookies for my neighbors. We may not all vote for the same party, but perhaps more important, we are all part of the same community. And who doesn’t love Double Chocolate Crinkle Cookies? Marilyn Hume
