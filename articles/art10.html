By Zachary Woolfe Erin Wall, whose silvery yet warm soprano voice infused works by Mozart, Strauss, Britten and Mahler with luminous elegance, died on Oct. 8 at a hospital in Mississauga, Ontario. She was 44. The cause was metastatic breast cancer, Lyric Opera of Chicago said. Lyric Opera was an artistic home base for Ms. Wall, who received her professional start as a member of the company’s prestigious young artist program, now known as the Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center. Chicago was the site of the dramatic season-opening performance that jolted her nascent career in 2004, when she jumped in with just a few hours’ notice to replace an ill colleague as Donna Anna in Mozart’s “Don Giovanni.” John von Rhein of The Chicago Tribune wrote in his review that “in classic showbiz style, she came, she sang and she conquered.” He praised her voice’s “wide compass, gleaming high extension and ability to float a ravishing, seamless line.” Lyric Opera’s music director, Andrew Davis, a frequent collaborator with Ms. Wall, recalled their performance of Elgar’s oratorio “The Kingdom” in London in 2014. “There’s a marvelous soprano aria in that, ‘The sun goeth down,’” Mr. Davis said in an interview. “And I’ve never heard anyone sing it more beautifully, with such ease and such poignancy. I think of her singing and I get goose bumps.”
