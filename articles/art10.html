Perhaps most notably, 64 percent of respondents said they had already voted. By Trip Gabriel and Isabella Grullón Paz Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by three points in North Carolina, a battleground state that Mr. Trump won in 2016. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of 1,034 likely voters in North Carolina from Oct. 23 to Oct. 27. Joseph R. Biden Jr. holds a small but durable lead over President Trump in North Carolina, where fully 64 percent of likely voters say they have already cast their ballots, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll released on Thursday. In a crucial race for control of the Senate, Cal Cunningham, the Democrat, also maintained an edge over Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican, despite a late-breaking scandal over romantic texts Mr. Cunningham sent to a woman who is not his wife. Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump by 48 percent to 45 percent in the survey, which was conducted after the final presidential debate last week, from Friday to Tuesday. Nearly seven in 10 voters said they had watched the debate. At that event, Mr. Trump tried to present a more civil side to woo back Republicans put off by his spree of interruptions in his first encounter with Mr. Biden. North Carolinians were divided over the results: Thirty-six percent said Mr. Trump had won the debate, 35 percent thought Mr. Biden had, and 29 percent had no opinion. In the Senate matchup, Mr. Cunningham held a lead of three percentage points over Mr. Tillis, 46 to 43 percent. The Democratic challenger leads the Republican incumbent in the North Carolina Senate race. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of 1,034 likely voters in North Carolina from Oct. 23 to Oct. 27. Mr. Trump is scheduled to return to North Carolina on Thursday, his ninth campaign visit since early September, a sign that his campaign is worried about losing a state the president won by about 3.5 percentage points in 2016. Appearing vulnerable in the cities and suburbs, the president has visited rural regions to excite his base. This week, the state reported its second-highest number of patients hospitalized with the coronavirus in a day, 1,214, since the pandemic began. At a rally in North Carolina on Saturday, Mr. Trump dismissed the threat as overblown and driven by political enemies. “Covid, Covid, Covid,” he said. “By the way, on Nov. 4, you won’t hear about it anymore.” The margins in both the presidential and Senate races in the state were nearly identical to those in the previous Times/Siena poll, in mid-October, which found Mr. Biden and Mr. Cunningham both ahead by four points over their Republican opponents. If Mr. Cunningham unseats Mr. Tillis — who has lagged behind Mr. Trump’s support in the state — Democrats would be closer to netting the three seats they need for a Senate majority should Mr. Biden win the presidency. The party’s prospects of flipping Republican-held seats are considered the strongest in Arizona and Colorado, and they have pickup opportunities in Maine, Iowa and elsewhere. Republicans are well positioned to win a Democratic-held seat in Alabama. One difference in North Carolina, though, was that the proportion of voters — 15 percent — who were undecided in the Senate race two weeks ago had shrunk to 6 percent. This suggests that voters have come home to their parties, but with no clear advantage for the Republican incumbent in a state closely split along party lines. Independents broke for Mr. Cunningham in the latest poll, 48 percent to 34 percent. The poll of 1,034 likely voters has a margin of error of about four percentage points. “I cringe sometimes at the things he says,” Michael Shawl, 48, said of Mr. Trump, whom he voted for both this year and in 2016. “But at the same time, he pushes the policies that he ran on. He’s trying to do exactly what he said he would do.” Mr. Shawl, who owns a construction and roofing business in Wilmington, N.C., said that the state’s Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, was “killing small businesses” but that the president was not. “I’d like to see him get the economy back on track,” he said of Mr. Trump. “I’d like to see a Covid vaccine released to the world. I’d like to see Obamacare replaced.” The single race that appeared to have shifted, if only slightly, was for governor. Mr. Cooper held a nine-point lead over Dan Forest, the Republican lieutenant governor. Two weeks ago, Mr. Cooper’s advantage was 14 points. Over the summer, Mr. Cooper refused to yield to Mr. Trump’s demand to loosen coronavirus restrictions to let the Republican National Convention take place in Charlotte. On Ocracoke Island off the Atlantic coast, Robin Macek, who owns a bed-and-breakfast, voted last week at a fire station for Mr. Biden, a ballot she had been waiting a long time to cast. “I just think all of this talk, especially with the pandemic — we all know someone who had it or died from it,” she said, adding of Mr. Trump, “he is still denying it and science even though he knew what could happen and how bad it could get.” She added: “And now to hear him say that he got us through it and it’s not even over. The conspiracies, the militias — it’s just been difficult, and worse than I could have imaged.” Mr. Biden’s lead was driven by greater support among women, voters under 45 and African-Americans. He prevailed by 88 percent to 5 percent among Black voters, who represented nearly one in five likely voters in the survey. Mr. Trump was winning with voters over 45 and, especially, with white voters without college degrees, who preferred the president by more than two to one. With more than three in five North Carolinians saying they had already voted, the poll demonstrated how much the race might already be set in place. Have you already voted? If yes, did you vote in person early or did you vote by mail? Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of 1,034 likely voters in North Carolina from Oct. 23 to 27. Note: Figures may not add up to 100 percent because of rounding. More Democrats than Republicans had cast their ballots. Of those who had, three out of four voted in person and one out of four by mail. About twice as many mail ballots were cast by Democrats, reflecting Mr. Trump’s disparagement of mail-in voting as ripe for fraud, a groundless claim. Seventy percent of mail voters said they had sent their ballots in before last week, reflecting fears that the Postal Service might not deliver them on time. Among early in-person voters, the partisan gap was much narrower. Chelsea Williams, 35, an elementary school teacher in Dallas, N.C., voted early for Mr. Biden, even though she likes “a lot of the economic issues” that the president is running on, she said. “I chose Biden only because there are a lot of underground racist issues when it comes to Trump,” she said. Mostly, Ms. Williams said, she wants the election to be over. “I’m tired of the spam mail, the lies — I want us to pick a president,” she said. “It just feels like they’re playing with our lives and our health right now with this election, and that’s on both sides.” Here are the crosstabs for the poll. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
