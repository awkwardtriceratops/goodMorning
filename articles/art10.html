A $1.5 Trillion Deal Can Make It Happen.<br></h1><p id="artcont">A compromise struck by House Democrats and Republicans to deliver aid during the pandemic merits consideration. By Jay C. Shambaugh Dr. Shambaugh was the chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers from 2010 to 2011. The pandemic brought on the most quick and severe recession that the United States has ever experienced. The economy shed over 22 million jobs in just two months, and contracted at an annualized rate of 32 percent in the second quarter. While the trillions of dollars in relief from the CARES Act, passed in March, softened the blow at first, most of its crucial support to jobless people and businesses has now ended. Democratic congressional leaders are now locked in a stalemate with the White House and Senate Republicans on a follow-up measure. It may be easier, politically, to give up and devolve into partisan blaming as Election Day nears. However, it is imperative that a new deal is reached to avoid suffering and to keep the economy from further slowing. The coronavirus still kills thousands every week, requiring people and businesses to take precautions that limit economic activity. Emergency federal unemployment benefits have expired for tens of millions of unemployed Americans. State and local governments are facing extreme budget distress; food insecurity is at its highest level in decades. Weâ€™ve regained only about half the jobs lost in the spring. More money from Congress is both fiscally affordable and deeply needed.
