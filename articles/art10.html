But Will They Send Their Children to School?<br></h1><p id="artcont">So far, nearly 40 percent of families have opted to have their children learn fully remotely when public schools reopen on Sept. 21. By Eliza Shapiro Adriana Aviles has been holding dress rehearsals for the first day of school. Her three children wear face masks in their Queens home all day, every other day, to practice for when they return to school buildings in a few weeks. Ms. Aviles says her children cannot wait to go back to school, and she is frustrated that the city recently delayed the start date by nearly two weeks, to Sept. 21. “We’ll get some normalcy hopefully, and God willing we’ll be OK,” she said of the return to school. “We practiced what we need to practice.” Across the city, in Harlem, Lisandra Sanchez recently delivered some disappointing news to her son, a rising high school freshman: She did not think it was safe for him to physically attend school because some classes might be held outdoors. She is worried about crime around the building, so she opted her son out of in-person learning.
