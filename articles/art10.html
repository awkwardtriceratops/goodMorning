My Family Is Suffering.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Police violence takes a largely invisible toll on Black families. By Rick Blake Mr. Blake is the uncle of Jacob Blake. Hotels, hospitals, rehabilitation centers, media interviews. In recent months, this has been the daily ordeal of my brother, Jacob Blake Sr. — or as we call him in our family, “Big Jake.” He regularly visited the hospital bedside in Milwaukee where his son, my nephew, lay partly paralyzed for over a month before being transferred to a spinal rehabilitation facility in Chicago. At first, Jacob Blake Jr. — “Li’l Jake” — was semiconscious. Bullets had ripped through his slim body when a police officer shot him seven times in the back outside an apartment complex in Kenosha, Wis., on Aug. 23. His small legs were chained to the steel frame of the hospital bed. “Chains should not be placed on a human being,” I remember my brother saying. At his first hospital visit, he just sat by his son’s side holding his hand. The silence was broken only by the beeps and clatter of hospital monitors. Our family was preparing for painful news about the prognosis. But one day, as his father held his hand, Li’l Jake opened his eyes and said the words every father wants to hear: “Daddy, is that really you? I love you.” To my brother and our entire family, this was a deliverance. Li’l Jake was alive. Our story is different from those of many families whose lives have been devastated by police brutality — our Li’l Jake survived. But in mostly every other way, the experience is similar. When the cameras stop rolling, the lights fade and public attention turns away, we’re left with our pain and we return to the battle against racism and for justice and reform. My brother, who has recently spent six to eight hours a day with Li’l Jake at his rehabilitation  facility, is a massive man. He was once a defensive tackle at Winston-Salem State University in North Carolina. He also has diabetes, heart disease and chronic neuropathy. The shooting of his son has forced this him to put himself at further risk during a pandemic that disproportionately affects Black men and others in our community. The toll on my brother has gone largely unnoticed — except, of course, by members of our family. One night, he sat in the dark on a rock next to the hotel where he was staying, so sick and tired he couldn’t move, his hand swollen to the size of a catcher’s mitt from gout. By chance, the director of the hospital where Li’l Jake was being treated found him and he was taken to the emergency room for treatment. Despite this kind of setback, my brother knows he must keep going on, willing his big body to take the next step each day. For his son. For his family. For justice. “If I have to sacrifice myself for my son and my family, so be it,” he has told me.
