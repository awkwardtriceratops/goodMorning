These Women Have More Money and Better Ideas.<br></h1><p id="artcont">The president’s target du jour, Laurene Powell Jobs, isn’t the only woman with a vast fortune making meaningful change. By Kara Swisher Ms. Swisher is a contributing opinion writer. This past weekend, in yet another political attack aimed at a woman with power, President Trump rage-tweeted at Laurene Powell Jobs. Steve Jobs would not be happy that his wife is wasting money he left her on a failing Radical Left Magazine that is run by a con man (Goldberg) and spews FAKE NEWS & HATE. Call her, write her, let her know how you feel!!! https://t.co/wwuoP85bQE Get in a faux lather, rinse with bile, repeat ad nauseam — right? The list of Mr. Trump’s sexist attacks on women — he likes to call them “nasty” — is long. He seems to delight in going after women of color, like his criticism this summer against the mayor of Washington, Muriel Bowser, and the mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot. But the attack on Ms. Powell Jobs was craven even by Mr. Trump’s standards for its plainly sexist effort to diminish her by raising the specter of her husband, the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, being displeased with how she was using his enormous fortune. This, even though Mr. Jobs has been dead since 2011, and the money was also always hers, since the pair had been married 20 years. The concept of sharing marital wealth is something the prenup-signing Mr. Trump cannot conceive of. With his outburst, you could almost hear the inside of his head clanging madly at the very idea of a woman with the motivation and moxie, as well as the intelligence, doing whatever she wants with her own huge pile of money. Better not tell Mr. Trump then that there are two even wealthier women from the world of tech — Mackenzie Scott, who recently divorced from the Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos, and Melinda Gates, who is married to the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates — who are also having a significant influence on this nation with efforts the president surely doesn’t like. Worse for him, they will continue to profoundly reshape society in the years to come. And before those who don’t know how modern marriages actually work claim that these women did not come to their power by inventing anything themselves, let me point out that the Trump children — and Mr. Trump himself — try to pretend they are where they are due to talent and not family relationships. More to the point, as someone who has had a front-row seat covering tech for more than 30 years, I’ve seen first-hand how all three women had a significant impact on the companies and on their spouses, especially in the very critical early days of their careers.
