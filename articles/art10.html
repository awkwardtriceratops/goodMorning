By Nate Cohn Joe Biden now leads in states worth 306 electoral votes. Here’s the state of play in the places that matter most on Friday. Mr. Biden has taken a narrow lead in Pennsylvania, as absentee votes are slowly being tabulated this morning. According to the Pennsylvania secretary of state, 163,501 absentee ballots remain to be counted. This number is about 37,000 votes too high, as it does not appear to include the most recent wave of mail absentee ballots that gave Mr. Biden the lead. There seems no reason to doubt that he will hold a comfortable lead once all of the absentee votes are counted. So far, absentee ballots have backed Mr. Biden by a margin of 76 percent to 23 percent. If the remaining ballots break the same way, he will end up ahead by about 70,000 votes statewide.
