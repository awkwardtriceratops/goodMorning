The Portland shooting amplified tensions in the presidential race. Trump embraces fringe theories on protests and the coronavirus. A shift on election briefings to Congress could create an information gap for voters. An advocacy group’s ‘Unbossed Women’s Agenda’ would help Black domestic workers. Joseph R. Biden Jr faces a crosscurrent of pressures as protests continue to batter Portland, Ore., and Kenosha, Wis. On one side is President Trump, who is trying to blame Mr. Biden for the unrest as he presses the theme of his convention — remember that? It was last week — that a Biden presidency would lead to disorder and crime. He has repeatedly used false claims to portray Mr. Biden as anti-law enforcement. On the other are some Democrats  who have always been a little wary of Mr. Biden’s political fortitude against a candidate like Mr. Trump. Some are concerned that the Democratic standard-bearer has been slow to push back on the notion that Democrats are responsible for violence taking place under the Trump presidency. “How do you cede the violence narrative when it’s directly a result of Trump and has nothing to do with Biden?” said Moe Vela, a former aide to Mr. Biden at the White House. Mr. Trump, who spent Sunday bashing the mayor of Portland on Twitter over the unrest there, plans to travel on Tuesday to Kenosha, where disturbances broke out after a white police officer shot and paralyzed a Black man. Mr. Biden is giving a speech today in Pittsburgh. The risks for Mr. Biden are clear. Law and disorder have become a major theme of the Trump campaign. If he chooses to play it safe, Mr. Biden could come across as timid or tentative. But this could also be a political opportunity for Mr. Biden. It plays into a central theme of his candidacy: that a Biden presidency would bring a return to normalcy and an end to the chaos of the Trump presidency, marked by the president’s struggle to respond to the pandemic, the economic decline and the unrest on the streets. In a statement he released Sunday on the Portland shooting, Mr. Biden charged Mr. Trump with fomenting the very unrest that the president is trying to blame Mr. Biden and other Democrats for. “I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same,” Mr. Biden wrote. “It is not a peaceful protest when you go out spoiling for a fight. What does President Trump think will happen when he continues to insist on fanning the flames of hate and division in our society and using the politics of fear to whip up his supporters?” Mr. Biden has run a deliberately cautious campaign — to stay out of the way and let Mr. Trump, as one Democrat put it, run against Mr. Trump. But as the general election begins, and with Mr. Biden under attack and the country racked by such turmoil, a lot of Democrats are looking to see how aggressively Mr. Biden engages Mr. Trump at what feels like a critical point in their competition. — Adam Nagourney and Shane Goldmacher The fatal shooting in Portland, Ore., over the weekend capped a volatile week of street violence that increasingly hangs over the 2020 race. On Saturday, a man affiliated with a right-wing group was shot and killed as a large caravan of supporters of Mr. Trump drove through downtown Portland, where nightly protests have unfolded for three consecutive months. No suspect has been publicly identified and the victim’s name has not been released. The shooting came in the same week that a 17-year-old armed with a military-style weapon was charged with homicide in connection with shootings during a protest in Kenosha, Wis., that left two people dead and one injured. The pro-Trump rally in Portland drew hundreds of trucks filled with supporters and adorned with Trump flags and American flags into the city. At times, Trump supporters and counterprotesters clashed in the streets, with fistfights occurring and Trump supporters shooting paintball guns from the beds of pickup trucks as protesters threw objects at them. The shooting that night immediately reverberated in a presidential campaign now entering its most intense period, and came on the heels of a Republican National Convention in which the president had sought to reframe the 2020 race as a “law and order” election.
