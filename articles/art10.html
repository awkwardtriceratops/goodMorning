To the Editor: Re “Trump Nominated as G.O.P. Delivers Ominous Message” (front page, Aug. 25): The first night of the Republican convention was a true personification of Donald Trump — full of exaggerations, unsupported claims, misrepresentations, unbelievable praise and baldfaced lies, Mr. Trump’s go-to tactics every day. Only the willfully ignorant believe this nonsense. James G. Goodale
Fort Myers, Fla. To the Editor: I watched the first hour of the Republican convention. The Republicans are still playing the same old fear card, the same message they have been using since Richard Nixon’s 1968 campaign. Ho hum. Martha Broad
Bryn Mawr, Pa. To the Editor: Joe Biden is for a national mask mandate. About 177,000 pandemic deaths later, Donald Trump still opposes one. At the Republican National Convention, Mr. Trump appeared alongside seven frontline workers. None wore a mask. All stood less than six feet apart. None were African-American or Latino, although millions have disproportionately risked their lives to help their fellow citizens as essential workers. Mr. Trump did find a few African-Americans willing to safely sing his praises from an isolated lectern in an empty hall. They included the former N.F.L. player Herschel Walker, who claimed that our divider in chief is not a racist, but a believer in social justice. Yes, and neo-Nazis marching in Charlottesville included “very fine people.” Joshua Fuld Nessen
Weston, Conn. To the Editor: Why would the Republicans skip the process of writing an election platform? Was the G.O.P. too disorganized to pull it off? That is certainly possible. More likely, though, the party has no need for a platform. The only thing it stands for is whatever President Trump decides he wants to do on any given day. Heading into an election without a platform means that Republicans openly acknowledge they operate in a policy-free zone. This is no longer the G.O.P.; it is now the P.O.T. (Party of Trump). Todd R.

Whitefish, Mont. To the Editor: Whenever an incumbent president seeks a second term, it is always appropriate to ask two key questions: Am I better off than I was four years ago? Is our country better off than it was four years ago? In his campaign four years ago, Donald Trump gave us a green light to ask these questions now by promising that he would “make America great again.” We now can grade his performance by using that slogan. During four years in the White House, has he made America great again? Has he made a significant start on it? Mr. Trump also said repeatedly in 2016 that he would “drain the swamp,” as well as “I alone can fix it” and “What have you got to lose?” Everyone who cares about this country should think carefully about those utterances — and about whether they were fulfilled — before casting their ballots this fall.
