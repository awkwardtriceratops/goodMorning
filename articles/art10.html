By Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Fatima Faizi KABUL, Afghanistan — It was an unusually pleasant fall day, and the two Kabul University students joked that they could afford to be a bit late to class to catch some sun. The students, Ahmad Ali Mohammedi and Sajat Naijati, then headed to their classrooms. Mr. Mohammedi, 25, took the stairs to the second floor of the university’s National Legal Training Center. Mr. Naijati, 21, walked to his on the first floor. In less than an hour on Monday morning, those locations would decide which of them would survive. Mr. Mohammedi was shot and killed after gunmen burst into his classroom. Mr. Naijati clambered from the window on the floor below, cutting his face and bruising his head and nose, before sprinting to safety. At least 21 others were killed and dozens wounded as the attackers barricaded themselves in classrooms, took hostages and systematically tried to kill the future of Afghanistan, a country that, after 40 years of war, stalled peace negotiations and political infighting, has been all but incapacitated by surging violence. “We didn’t look back,” said Mr. Naijati, 21, who was sitting at home, his head bandaged and a dark purple bruise under his eye. “We ran to save ourselves.” The fate of the two companions, decided by a few yards and a class schedule, is one endlessly replicated by the war in Afghanistan. Just over a week ago, a suicide bomber killed more than 40 people outside an education center just miles away from Kabul University, the country’s oldest and largest academic institution with roughly 25,000 students. On Tuesday, Afghanistan declared a national day of mourning. Mr. Mohammedi was buried — his body facing toward where the sun sets among the brown mountains that skirt the city — in a small unassuming cemetery in a poor neighborhood of west Kabul. Men wept as he was interred, his brother wailing as he was carried to a nearby car to rest. Mustafa Sorush, a neighborhood friend, quietly looked on. “He died with all our hopes,” Mr. Sorush, 31, said. Mr. Mohammedi was in his final year of studies in public policy, with an ambition to attend Stanford or Harvard, Mr. Naijati said. His portrait, with jet-black hair and pensive brown eyes, was affixed to his headstone with clear packing tape.
