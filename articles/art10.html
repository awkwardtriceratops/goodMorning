But something curious has happened during the last few days. Since election night, when I wake up, that glass of wine has remained full and untouched. I no longer need that glass of wine to take the edge off. There is no edge. My fear has been replaced with optimism. My anxiety has been replaced with hope. And as I danced in the streets with my Pittsburgh neighbors on Saturday night, I was truly happy about the future of America for the first time in four years. Mary Ann Bohrer
Pittsburgh To the Editor: Now that President Trump has lost the election, my family and our nation must acknowledge a debt of gratitude to him. He forced my children, ages 23 to 33, to pay close attention to politics for the first time in their lives. He compelled them, in ways I never could, to understand the intricacies and absurdity of the Electoral College. I am also grateful that he spurred them to activism on behalf of those less fortunate than themselves.
