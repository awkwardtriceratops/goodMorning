To the Editor: It seems to me that President Trump’s continued refusal to concede defeat is less a sinister plot to cling to power and more a determination to somehow declare victory even in defeat. If the recent vaccine news holds true, that will be an extraordinary accomplishment by our scientific community, and let’s give credit where it’s due — and maybe even some that’s not due. Let’s all agree to praise Mr. Trump for Operation Warp Speed’s success and congratulate him for the fastest and most robust (or best and most beautiful) vaccine campaign in history. Let him take that win as his way to declare a personal victory and make way for President-elect Joe Biden. If Mr. Trump is going to continue to hold incredible sway over his supporters in his post-presidency, I can think of no better role for him than as a champion of the effectiveness of the “Trump” Covid vaccines. Maybe he can reach people who would otherwise be reluctant to get vaccinated. So let me be the first to congratulate him. Heckuva job, Donnie! Will Brennan
Girdwood, Alaska To the Editor: Irony of ironies. If Donald Trump had spent a fraction of the energy on fighting Covid-19 as he has trying to overturn the election, he would have won the election. Bobbie Kaplan
