Trump, the President’s Younger Brother, Dies at 71<br></h1><p id="artcont">A loyal spokesman for the family, he shunned the spotlight and had “zero sense of entitlement.” By Annie Karni Robert S. Trump, the younger brother of President Trump, died on Saturday night in Manhattan. He was 71. The White House, which announced his death, at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, did not give a cause. “He was not just my brother, he was my best friend,” the president said in a statement. “He will be greatly missed, but we will meet again.” Robert Trump, who took blood thinners, had experienced brain bleeds, which began after a recent fall, according to a family friend. President Trump went to Manhattan on Friday to see his brother at the hospital. On Saturday, when Robert Trump was not expected to live much longer, the president called into the hospital from his Bedminster, N.J., golf club. He shortly held a news conference but did not mention his brother’s health. Friends who spoke to him said he was downcast. “I have a wonderful brother,” the president said on Friday at a White House news conference before departing to visit him. “We’ve had a great relationship for a long time, from Day 1.” The two had in fact been estranged for years before Mr. Trump’s run for the White House.
