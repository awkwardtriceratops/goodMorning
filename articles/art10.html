A crowd began to make its way toward his stretch of Tobay Beach, on Long Island, and within minutes, an unmistakable gray dorsal fin appeared just a few feet from shore. “It’s a little one,” he said, running toward the water to haul the thrashing shark into the shallows. It was a sandbar shark (also known as a brown shark), about five feet long. Mr. Stefanou quickly withdrew the hook from its jaw. A friend stretched out a measuring tape while Mr. Stefanou, a lean and athletic 24-year-old, straddled the shark and plunged a sharp metal tag into its back muscle, near the dorsal fin. More than a dozen onlookers snapped photos. “Tag No. 13, male, 59 inches,” he announced before guiding the animal back into the waves and watching it swim off. Like that, it was over. This was the 71st shark he had caught on Long Island this summer. Catching sharks off the New York coast is nothing new. For generations, recreational surf fishermen, some of them local legends with names like Kayak Joe and Stingray Steve, have been hooking sandbar sharks or duskies or sand tigers — usually unintentionally, as bycatch to bluefish and striped bass. But with warming seas and abundant prey, sharks are passing closer and closer to the South Shore each summer. And for a younger crop of Long Island surf-casters looking for impressive photos to post on social media, the thrill of landing an apex predator is irresistible. At times, it can be a brutal and bloody spectacle. The sharks often bleed from the hooks, and the fishermen sometimes bleed from the sharks’ coarse, armor-like skin. It usually takes more than one person to land a shark — at least one handling the rod and reel and another wrangling the animal. The prize is usually a very impressive selfie before the shark is released — or something darker. One picture shared in a private Facebook group this summer showed a sand tiger shark discarded on a Long Island beach with its head cut off. “The shark angling community has a higher percentage of people that have this macho-man ‘I’m going to conquer giant beasts’ attitude,” said David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist and shark expert at Arizona State University. One particular set of photos from July caused a stir: In them, a college student from suburban Manhasset, N.Y., posed for a series of pictures, flexing and reclining alongside a large shark he had caught and later released. In one, he pulled its nose up to show its teeth. “I was not a fan of what that guy did,” Mr. Stefanou said. Mr. Stefanou draws a sharp distinction between fishermen like “that guy” and himself. Even though he promotes his shark exploits on social media under the handle LI Sharkman, on the beach he expresses concern for the endangered species he catches and has spent several years learning how to handle the animals safely, he said. He also participates in a volunteer shark-tagging program managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a citizen-science effort that has produced useful data on shark migrations across oceans and up and down the coast.
