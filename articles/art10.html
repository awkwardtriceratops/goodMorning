By Frances Robles Nearly 200 boxes of uncounted votes have surfaced in Puerto Rico, a full week after voters went to the polls to choose their governor, legislators and mayors across the island, dealing another black eye to the mistrusted government. The discovery of uncounted ballots could have sweeping effects in close races around the island, in particular the tight contest for mayor of San Juan, where the sudden influx of new votes could force a recount. Officials acknowledged that the votes could change the results of particularly narrow races, which had already been preliminarily certified. In the city of Culebra, the mayor’s race currently has a margin of just two votes; in Guánica, nine. The electoral muddle — coming three months after a disastrous primary when people waited hours in sweltering heat for ballots that never arrived — further undermined confidence in the electoral process and underscored the deep distrust many residents have long had for the government. “The whole tragedy here is not so much how it turns out in the end, but it’s that I don’t think anyone in Puerto Rico after a failed primary and this current process can really say they trust the system,” said William Ramírez, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Puerto Rico, which had sued to allow more absentee ballots. “We had a large turnout of young people; they voted for the first time, and this was their experience.” The election followed a sea change in local politics last year when, tired of years of corruption scandals, masses of people took to the streets to force out the sitting governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló, after leaked text messages showed him and his allies mocking gay people, women and even the hurricane dead. The electoral results last week in Puerto Rico were already making history. Puerto Rican politics has for years been mainly controlled by two competing parties, focused largely on whether the island should become the 51st state or remain a commonwealth. While Pedro R. Pierluisi, a traditional party hand from Mr. Rosselló’s pro-statehood New Progressive Party, won the governor’s race last week, people from outside traditional parties made impressive showings at the polls. The results suggested that Puerto Rican voters, bucking precedent, had chosen particular candidates, not just parties. With six candidates in the governor’s race, including two from emerging political parties, Mr. Pierluisi, Puerto Rico’s former representative in Congress, won with just 33 percent of the vote. The Independence Party candidate, who typically gets about 3 percent support, received 14 percent of the vote, as did the Citizens Victory Movement, a relatively new party. For the first time, Puerto Rico’s legislature will be made up of a solid mix of politicians from different parties. The senator who got the highest number of votes in an island-wide at-large race was from the Independence Party. Two religious conservatives were elected to the legislature. And in the race for mayor of San Juan, a Citizens Victory Movement candidate, Manuel Natal Albelo, trailed by just over 2,000 votes. Rarely in recent years has someone from outside the two main parties come so close to being elected mayor of Puerto Rico’s largest city.
