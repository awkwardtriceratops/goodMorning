By Zeynep Tufekci Contributing Opinion Writer Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky recently tweeted what seemed to be a striking finding from a randomized study about the use of masks in the pandemic: “To the scolds blaming ⁦@realDonaldTrump infection on not wearing masks: the only published randomized clinical study of cloth masks shows 97% penetration of particles & higher infection rate than control. But never mind, it’s all about submission ….” The randomized clinical trial that Senator Paul and others have cited as a cautionary argument against mask-wearing did seem to reach a definite conclusion. “This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks,” its abstract proclaims. Case closed, right? Not at all. Although it’s easy to see why this 2015 study has become so prominent. As detractors of masks point out, randomized studies that prove the effectiveness of masks are nonexistent. That’s because doing an informative randomized study of masks for preventing transmission would present such major scientific and logistical challenges that it is all but practically impossible. To explain why, you need to know how randomized trials work and why they are so valued, and also why they are not the only form of scientific evidence. In order to understand whether drugs and other medical interventions work, researchers rely on randomized trials that assign participants randomly into a group that gets the intervention and a control group that gets nothing or a placebo. Otherwise, if we let doctors choose who they gave the drug to, they might pick sicker patients. Or if we let patients enroll as they wish, those who are already interested in healthy behaviors may disproportionately choose to try the new drug. Without randomization, it would be difficult to figure out if differences between the groups are due to the drug or to various pre-existing characteristics of the participants — known as confounding factors. According to a review in the journal Nature there are two continuing randomized trials, one in Denmark and the other in Guinea-Bissau. The article questions the ethics of conducting a randomized trial in such a poor African nation (spoiler alert: yes, it’s unethical). It also quotes scientists lamenting the time constraints preventing them from conducting proper clinical studies.
