To the Editor: Re “President’s Taxes Chart Chronic Losses, Audit Battle and Income Tax Avoidance” (front page, Sept. 28): Kudos to The Times for breaking this story. With Election Day five weeks away, the American people now have the vital information that President Trump has been hiding for years and can judge accordingly as to his fitness for office. There’s an even larger story here, however. Donald Trump isn’t the only wealthy American who has played our tax system. I hope that this investigation will continue and expand to include a comprehensive review of a tax code that benefits rich people and profitable companies at the expense of ordinary citizens — ordinary citizens who work hard and pay their taxes yet are constantly told that cuts in public programs and services must be made because the federal government “can’t afford them.” John E.

Rye, N.Y. To the Editor: It’s hard to know which is the most disturbing aspect of these revelations: the ability of the wealthy to exploit the tax code, President Trump’s interest in enriching himself and his family at the expense of others, or the certainty that his congressional supporters will continue to cheer him on regardless of their past declarations of him as a fraud and a cheat. Although I am heartened by the free and independent news media that has exposed the president’s mendacity and selfishness, we should all remain concerned that the president may be willing to pull any lever to retain the office of the president and hold off continued examination of his finances.
