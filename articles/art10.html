By Troy Closson By midnight on Saturday, about 80 guests had crowded into a sex club in Queens to drink and party. At around the same time, another group that grew to about 120 revelers was just starting to gather and dance at an illegal club in Manhattan. City sheriffs broke up both parties early on Sunday — the latest crackdown as officials try to rein in behavior that could fuel the second wave of the coronavirus. Seven people and one business face a range of charges in connection with the parties, including a failure to protect health and safety in violation of the city’s health code, the authorities said. The sites of the two gatherings lacked liquor licenses and other certifications, according to the sheriff’s office, and images from the events showed many attendees were failing to wear masks or practice social distancing. The busts underscored the continued challenges of persuading New Yorkers to follow safety guidelines even as a second wave of the virus hits, particularly as the winter months approach and parties move indoors. Over the past four weeks, the sheriff’s office has shut down several large parties and events, ranging from a gathering of close to 170 people at an illicit club in Brooklyn to a Halloween celebration in the Bronx with more than 550 attendees. Sheriff Joseph Fucito said at the start of the month that his office had responded to about one large event every evening since August. Earlier this month, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that private indoor and outdoor gatherings across the state would be limited to 10 people. But enforcing those rules is likely to be even more difficult as the weather turns colder and as people celebrate the holidays. The recent rash of parties comes as positivity rates kick upward: On Sunday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the citywide seven-day average positivity rate was 3.09 percent, while the statewide rate was 2.74 percent, according to Mr. Cuomo.
