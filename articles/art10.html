By Patricia Mazzei, Nicole Perlroth and Frances Robles MIAMI — Florida’s voter registration website crashed on Monday before the state’s midnight deadline, raising questions about whether the state was prepared for an enormous last-minute influx of voters. The registration site was experiencing more than a million requests per hour, said state officials, who announced that the deadline for new voter registrations would be extended by a day, through 7 p.m. Tuesday. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, said the trouble began at about 5 p.m. on Monday. “It was an inordinate amount of traffic” for about seven hours until midnight, he said. “If 500,000 people descend at the same time, it creates a bottleneck.” “You can have the best site in the world,” he added. “Sometimes there’s hiccups on it.” The website gave users error messages and caused delays, prompting some state officials and cybersecurity experts to question whether the website had been targeted by hackers. Secretary of State Laurel M. Lee, a DeSantis appointee who is the state’s top elections official, alluded to a possible outside attack in a statement on Tuesday. “We’re exploring all options to ensure that all eligible registrants have the ability to register to vote and will work with our state and federal law-enforcement partners to ensure this was not a deliberate act against the voting process,” she said. Some cybersecurity analysts said the large influx of requests to the website could have been the result of a denial-of-service attack, in which hackers clog a site with traffic requests until it collapses under the load. Such a large volume of traffic “could certainly indicate that the election infrastructure was the subject of a DDoS attack,” said Brett Callow, a threat analyst at Emsisoft, using the shorthand for a distributed denial-of-service attack. Other cybersecurity experts advised caution, noting that a typical denial-of-service attack often generates hundreds of millions of hits per second. If this was a denial-of-service attack, it was a small one, they said. More likely, these experts said, the incident appeared to be attributable to an information technology staff that was ill-prepared to handle the last-minute flood of traffic from legitimate voter registrations on Monday and then a second wave from journalists and digital rubber-neckers looking into the reported issues. A spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said the department was not investigating and directed questions back to the Department of State. Ms. Lee said the website received “an unprecedented 1.1 million requests per hour” late on Monday. In announcing an extension of Monday’s voter registration deadline, she said that any applications received on Tuesday — either online, in person at elections’ supervisors, tax collections and motor vehicles offices, or postmarked by Tuesday — would be accepted. The offices would stay open until 7 p.m., Mr. DeSantis said in a news conference.
