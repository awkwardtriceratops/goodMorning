Already frustrated at the deplorable conditions, inhabitantsâ€™ anger was compounded by coronavirus lockdown restrictions. The situation reached a breaking point this month when fires were set, probably by a small group of irate asylum seekers, according to the authorities. The flames decimated the camp and stranded nearly 12,000 of its residents in the wild among tombstones in a nearby cemetery and on rural and coastal roads. We chart the European refugee crisis and the events that led up to the blaze at Moria.
