Stopping the Child
Sex Abusers<br></h1><p id="artcont">Supported by Three factors contribute to this crisis of child abuse: impunity, poverty and a deeply rooted culture of male domination. By Heriberto Araújo Mr. Araújo is working on a book on violence in the Amazon. PÁRA STATE, Brazil — It’s been nearly five years since J.S. de Brito began a legal battle to protect his daughter, who was sexually abused when she was only 2, and to prosecute the man he suspects committed the crime — the child’s maternal grandfather. Despite medical evidence confirming that the child was molested, the case has stalled. The justice system in this region of the Brazilian Amazon has allowed the possible abuser to continue to have almost daily contact with his victim. Mr. Brito, who is 38, lives here in Pará State, in Breves — a town of 100,000 people, battered by poverty and unemployment. He shares custody of his daughter, a result of an extramarital affair, with her mother. Though for months he suspected that his daughter was being abused, he didn’t take legal action until January 2016, when the child complained during a bath of “pain in private parts.” “The little girl had returned from her mother’s house that morning,” Mr. Brito said, explaining that the mother lived with her own father and that a 6-year-old cousin also spent a lot of time at the house. He took his daughter to a hospital so she could be examined, he said, and doctors confirmed his worst fears: She had suffered vaginal and anal penetration (probably with a finger). According to court documents, the child said her cousin had abused her. Mr. Brito, however, suspects that the grandfather, whom he says might have a drinking problem, was also likely involved. He argues that his daughter had previously shown signs that she was afraid of both her cousin and grandfather. Mr. Brito asked social services to revoke the mother’s custody, at least temporarily, to prevent the little girl from being abused again. He also reported the case to the police. But nothing came of it. The police interviewed both parents. According to court documents, the mother said the abuse occurred when the child was with Mr. Brito, not while she was with her. When I reached out to her, she said she and her daughter were victims of a “plot to separate them,” but had no further comment. Mr. Brito also said he asked that social services place the child in a shelter for abused children. But he was told there that there was no space available. He was told that, as there was no evidence that the abuse was committed in the mother’s home, it was better for the child to remain there. Court documents show that the police never spoke with the grandfather. What’s more, he worked as a receptionist at the police station where the witnesses gave their statements. Without further investigation, the detective on the case concluded that the young cousin was the only abuser. The Pará State prosecutor’s office in Breves subsequently asked that the case be dismissed, arguing that a 6-year-old child could not be tried. Mr. Brito hired a private lawyer and appealed to the federal authorities to keep the case open, and he asked that the police investigate the grandfather. In April 2019 a judge agreed and gave the police a month to work on the case. But it has since stalled again. According to official data from Pará State, 861 cases of sexual abuse of children and adolescents were reported in 2019. But experts argue that the number is certainly much higher, because only 10 percent of cases are reported. In 2010, a parliamentary commission of inquiry in Pará found that, between 2004 and 2008 there may have been “nearly 100,000 cases of violence and sexual abuse against children and adolescents.” Three factors contribute to this crisis of child abuse: impunity, poverty and a deeply rooted culture of male domination. The abuse of minors in Brazil is not limited to the Amazon. In São Paulo, the most developed city in the country, 84 births were registered to girls between the ages of 10 and 14 over just three months this year. In August, the pregnancy of a 10-year-old girl in Espírito Santo shocked the country. For four years she had been raped repeatedly by her uncle. The hospital that she was admitted to refused to terminate the pregnancy, even though the little girl’s life was in danger. In the end a judge intervened, and she was transferred to a hospital in another state where the procedure was done. But in the Amazon, perpetrators’ impunity and victims’ insecurity are more acute than in other areas. The region is home to some of the lowest human development indexes in the country. Remoteness and logistical difficulties often prevent victims from even reporting crimes.
