By Adam Liptak WASHINGTON — There have been nine seats on the Supreme Court for a long time. Could that change? The Constitution allows Congress to add or subtract seats, and it has done so several times, though not since 1869. Over the years, Congress has reduced the number of seats to as few as five and increased it to as many as 10. The changes were often made for partisan advantage. There are contemporary analogies, too. In the past decade, according to a recent study, legislation was introduced in at least 10 state legislatures, most controlled by Republicans, to change the size of their highest courts. In Arizona and Georgia, the proposals succeeded. The two states were controlled by Republicans, and the moves made the courts more conservative. “At the very least, that practice is in tension with the current Republican claim that court packing is an affront to separation of powers and must be off the table,” said Marin K. Levy, a law professor at Duke and the author of the study, which was published in The William & Mary Law Review. The recent confirmation wars at the federal level have prompted calls to increase the size of the U.S. Supreme Court should Democrats capture the White House and Congress in the election next month. Some liberals say it would be a fitting response to the Republican blockade of President Barack Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland in 2016, which effectively reduced the number of seats on the court to eight for more than a year on the premise that an opening in an election year should be filled by the new president. The rush now to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett, whose hearings begin Monday, before the election has only deepened anger on the left. “The size of the court has changed six times in American history, and the Constitution clearly gives Congress the right to shape the contours of the court,” said Aaron Belkin, the director of Take Back the Court, which he described as “a campaign to inform public opinion about the urgency of court expansion as a necessary step to restore democracy.” No president has tried to change the size of the court since 1937, when Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced what came to be known as his court-packing plan. It failed in the immediate sense: The number of justices stayed steady at nine. But it seemed to exert pressure on the court, which began to uphold progressive New Deal legislation. Still, the experiment discouraged serious discussion of changing the size of the court. Indeed, court packing turned into an all-purpose response to efforts to shape the judiciary; Republicans accused Mr. Obama of it in 2013, when he sought to fill three existing vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
