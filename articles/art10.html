By Eliza Shapiro On paper, Tiffani Torres looked like a strong candidate for one of New York City’s highest-performing, most selective public high schools. She had high test scores and excellent grades. “I was a good fit for what the school was looking for,” Tiffani said. But when Tiffani was rejected by her dream school, Eleanor Roosevelt High School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, she didn’t realize she never had much of a chance in the first place. That’s because Tiffani lived in Brownsville, a mostly low-income, Black and Hispanic neighborhood in the center of Brooklyn. “At the time,” she said, “I didn’t understand what my ZIP code had to do with anything.” As New York City races to reopen school buildings physically next month, it is clear that the pandemic has exacerbated the gap between the wealthy and everyone else. But the unusual admissions carve-out available to children in some of the city’s richest neighborhoods shows just how profoundly inequality was baked into the nation’s largest public school system, long before the virus hit. Eleanor Roosevelt, on East 76th Street, can fill most of its seats with students who already live in New York City’s School District 2 before considering students from other parts the city. The district weaves a conspicuous path through Manhattan’s richest neighborhoods — from the Upper East Side to the West Village, SoHo and Tribeca. But the boundary lines exclude nearby neighborhoods that have large concentrations of public housing and low-income students, including East Harlem, the Lower East Side and Chinatown. The lines were drawn in the late 1960s, decades before parts of the district became wealthy, but have remained largely untouched for the last half-century. Unlike a vast majority of high schools in New York City, Eleanor Roosevelt and five other high schools in District 2, which are some of the city’s best, give high-performing students who live in the district first dibs. Children in most of the city’s poorest neighborhoods have no such perk. Instead, they generally compete with tens of thousands of students across New York for high school seats. As mass protests against institutionalized racism have forced liberal New York City to reckon with its entrenched inequality, the segregated nature of its school system — along with District 2’s lopsided demographics and rare admissions exception — has once again come into focus. Several hundred teachers in the district recently signed a letter calling on the city to overhaul its competitive middle school admissions process and replace it with a lottery system modeled on a new effort to integrate middle schools in a largely upper-middle-class area of Brooklyn. “The practice of screening and separating our students does not speak to our values as teachers,” the educators wrote. Some experts say getting rid of the priority system in District 2 high schools is an obvious next step in the protracted battle for genuine integration. “I don’t understand it, I’ve never understood it,” Amy Stuart Wells, a professor at Columbia University’s Teachers College, said of the exception. “It’s so unfair.” The District 2 priority was established in the 1990s as part of an effort to keep the neighborhood’s middle-class parents invested in their local district through high school, even as schools in much of the rest of the city struggled. But schools across the city have improved in the decades since, leaving some to wonder why an admissions exception that benefits a small but influential number of families has been left untouched. Mayor Bill de Blasio has spent the last two years pushing to overhaul admissions for the city’s eight so-called specialized high schools — the only ones in the city whose admissions are controlled by the State Legislature. Though the mayor has the unilateral power to change or eliminate the District 2 priority, he has been noncommittal on the issue. “We are taking a hard look at our admissions policies to ensure we are serving every community equitably,” Jane Meyer, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said this spring. While specialized high schools like Stuyvesant and Bronx Science have mostly low-income Asian-American students, District 2’s selective high schools are largely white and middle- or upper-middle class. That has prompted several politicians who represent parts of District 2 — including the City Council speaker and mayoral candidate Corey Johnson — to support changing the priority system. Because of district boundary lines that exclude neighborhoods with large populations of Black and Hispanic children, Eleanor Roosevelt is one of the whitest public high schools in New York City. Last year, two-thirds of Eleanor Roosevelt’s students were white; only 3 percent of the student body was Black. The school boasts a perfect graduation rate — almost unheard-of for a public high school in the city — and an active parent-teacher association that requested $1,000 donations per child in 2018 for a $200,000 operating budget. That money went to the school’s college admissions office, and to athletics and after-school programs. About 20 percent of its students lived at or below the poverty line, a seemingly high number that is actually significantly below the city average; about three-quarters of New York’s public school students are considered poor. In an attempt to bolster diversity, starting this year Eleanor Roosevelt will for the first time reserve about a third of its freshman seats for low-income students who live in in District 2 — or, in the unlikely event that there are not enough local applicants, in the borough of Manhattan.
