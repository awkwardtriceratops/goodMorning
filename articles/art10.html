There’s a lot to worry about. We’re holding an election during a pandemic. Republicans are discussing aggressive tactics aimed, some charge, at suppressing the Democratic vote. And President Trump, who has sown doubts about mail-in voting, has repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power should he lose. Democrats hope for an overwhelming “blue wave” to forestall such shenanigans. How can you help ensure this outcome? Giving money is fine, but you can also donate your energy. Volunteer. Here’s a list of some ways to help. This is, in many ways, the easiest way to participate. Once you sign up, the campaign will direct you to where it thinks it thinks you’ll be most effective, which may include battleground states. You can also specify areas you’d like to focus on. Creatives can sign up to create graphics, memes and other content. Spanish-speakers can sign up to call or text voters. And anyone can download the Vote Joe App. One of the most effective ways to increase voter turnout, experts told me repeatedly, is to ensure that your friends and family know how to vote. Once downloaded, the app finds those in your contact list who live in a battleground state, so that you can reach out to them. Poll workers are especially in demand this year because of the pandemic. The people who often staff polling sites — older, retired people — are more likely to stay home. If poll sites don’t have enough workers, they can’t open, making it harder for people to vote. Poll work is nonpartisan (and often paid). The nonprofit group Work Elections can help you find your local election office, where you can sign up. Or you can sign up through Power The Polls, which aims to recruit poll workers around the country.
