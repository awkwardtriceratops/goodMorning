The decision to release the Marine, Lance Cpl. Joseph Scott Pemberton, angered both Philippine nationalist groups that oppose the country’s military agreements with the United States and advocates for gay and transgender rights who said Mr. Duterte had shown leniency toward a hate crime. Lance Corporal Pemberton, then 20, was convicted of homicide in 2015 for the killing of Jennifer Laude, 26. He was sentenced to six to 12 years in prison — a term that was later reduced to 10 years — and has since been held at Camp Aguinaldo, the Philippine military headquarters in metropolitan Manila. The foreign minister, Teodoro Locsin Jr., said on Twitter that to “do justice,” Mr. Duterte had granted an “absolute pardon,” effectively reducing the Marine’s sentence to time served. Mr. Duterte defended his decision in a public address on Monday. “If there is a time when you are called upon to be fair, be fair,” he said. Mr. Duterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque, said that Mr. Duterte had no intention of forgiving Lance Corporal Pemberton. “The president has erased whatever punishment that Pemberton still faced,” Mr. Roque said. “What was never erased in the mind of the president is the conviction of Pemberton, who is a killer.” Mr. Roque, who once served as counsel to Ms. Laude’s family, said that the president had taken the action in the interest of an “independent foreign policy where he is a friend to everyone, an enemy to none.” The move could help mend relations with the United States after years in which Mr. Duterte has been gravitating toward China, despite Beijing’s increasingly hostile actions in the South China Sea, where the two countries have territorial disputes. In February, he threatened to scrap the Visiting Forces Agreement with the United States, though he reversed his stand in June. Renato Reyes Jr., of the nationalist group Bayan, said the pardon was clearly a political accommodation to the United States, which has been helping to check China’s rising aggression in the region.
