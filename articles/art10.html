Inquiry, but Only After Election<br></h1><p id="artcont">Mr. Trump’s lawyers said in a court filing that he was willing to be interviewed by investigators after voters cast their presidential ballots. By Ed Shanahan Eric Trump is ready to be interviewed under oath as part of an investigation by New York’s attorney general into the financing of his family company’s properties — but only after the presidential election. In a court filing on Thursday, lawyers for the company, the Trump Organization, expressed Mr. Trump’s willingness to comply with the inquiry by the attorney general, Letitia James. But while Mr. Trump is ready to answer questions from lawyers with Ms. James’s office, he does not want to do so before Nov. 3, Election Day, because of his “extreme travel schedule” and “to avoid the use of his deposition attendance for political purposes,” the filing says. The filing came after Ms. James — who is examining whether the Trump Organization committed fraud by inflating assets to get loans and tax benefits — asked a judge to order Mr. Trump to answer questions under oath and to order the company to hand over documents. Ms. James, a Democrat, sought the order after Mr. Trump, President Trump’s son and an executive vice president at the company, abruptly canceled an interview with her office in July, and the company said that it and its lawyers would not comply with seven subpoenas. Ms. James appeared unmoved by the younger Mr. Trump’s latest offer of cooperation. “We won’t allow any entity or individual to dictate how our investigation will proceed or allow anyone to evade a lawful subpoena,” she said in a statement. “No one is above the law, period.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
