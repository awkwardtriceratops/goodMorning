By Adam Liptak WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday refused for now to reinstate a federal requirement that women seeking to end their pregnancies using medications pick up a pill in person from a hospital or medical office. A judge had blocked the requirement in light of the coronavirus pandemic, saying that a needless trip to a medical facility during a health crisis very likely imposed an undue burden on the constitutional right to abortion. The Supreme Court’s brief, unsigned order said that “a more comprehensive record would aid this court’s review.” The justices instructed the trial judge to take a fresh look at the case and to rule within 40 days. In the meantime the disputed requirement will remain suspended.
