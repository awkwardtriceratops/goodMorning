By Victoria Shannon and Judith Levitt (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The holiday shopping season started with a bang. But only online. Consumers spent $9 billion on the web on Friday, a 21.6 percent increase over Black Friday in 2019.

The holiday shopping season comes at a critical moment for the U.S. economy, which is struggling again as the number of coronavirus cases is soaring amid colder weather. Today, President-elect Joe Biden formally announced his top economic advisers.

Here you can build your own dashboard to track the coronavirus in places important to you. 3. Republicans kept up their challenges to the election.
