She’s an actual comedian. She’s definitely funny. But it’s a tough act regardless – the tone of this convention has been so dark, in part because the times are dark. Cracking jokes could go sideways. Though, definitely not as sideways as talking to an empty chair. Which was, as Maggie points out, super weird. Today Chrissy Teigen cooked a delicious-looking salmon recipe on her Instagram, with her very adorable daughter. Donald Trump is now speaking live on Fox News. He told Sean Hannity that he “watched some, not that much” of the Democratic convention, adding “Lot of hate.” When Hannity noted the convention has featured a lot of talk about the president, Mr. Trump replied: “Yeah, I’d say so!” Another “Vice President Poonce” crack. Louis-Dreyfus is really running with this mispronunciation of Pence’s name…. The comedy juxtaposed to the serious videos is really quite jarring. “I"m proud to be a nasty, nasty woman,” Julia Louis-Dreyfus says, answering her critics. Is she checking Twitter offstage? The historian Jon Meacham wrote “The Soul of America,’’ whose themes have been echoed by Biden’s refrain that he is running to “restore the soul of America.” Lisa, were Louis-Dreyfus’s remarks approved by the Biden campaign? Someone close to the planning told me that the M.C.s crafted their remarks along with the convention planners. So they would both deliver the message and feel comfortable with what they were saying. These cracks definitely feel on brand for JLD. I’d be shocked if the convention planners didn’t have approval. Conventions are planned so meticulously. Especially one like this, that’s so heavily pre-taped. This is quite a lengthy segment for Meacham. Meacham is making the direct case for dealing with the country’s history with racism and sexism. Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico is next. Haaland is a member of the Laguna Pueblo. She was one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress in 2018.  Meacham concluded by saying, “We might just save our country … and our souls.” I’ve been really struck by the amount of moralistic, near religious language in this convention. “A proud 35th-generation native New Mexican.” Wow. Meanwhile, over on Fox News, Sean Hannity just tried to tee up Trump to attack Biden’s “mental acuity.” The president at first demurred – "I don’t want to get into that" – but then added, “Pretty obvious what’s going on.” (There is in fact no evidence that Biden is in poor health.) “I’m a symbol of our resilience,” Ms. Haaland added. Note of context: Democrats are counting on Native Americans to help Biden win Arizona. This segment is about older people, who depend on the mail to vote. This is Sarah Cooper, the viral Trump lip-syncer. Sarah Cooper is the Tina Fey of this cycle. Is this the first time we’ve heard Trump’s voice all week? There was, in fact, some Postal Service news today. The former U.S.P.S. inspector general accused Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin of trying to orchestrate an illegal hostile takeover of the agency.  “Let me put this in my own words…” Sarah Cooper says. I think it’s the first time I’ve heard Sarah Cooper’s real voice! Up next, remarks from the California and Michigan secretaries of state. It’s really astounding how much we’re hearing about the post office and voting rights this year. California’s Secretary of State Alex Padilla has been outspoken about his attempts to make it easier for residents to vote – by mail, early and in person, and same-day voter registration. Secretaries of state used to be the most obscure of statewide officials. But in the struggle over voting access and voter suppression, they have emerged as key figures at the nexus of one of the most important issues in politics. Padilla’s appearance reminds me of another key to November — we may not know the results on Election Day. He likes to say that it’s a feature, not a bug, of the system. Jenny, we almost certainly won’t know, if current trends stand. “Election results may take a little longer this year” is a crucial message Democrats want to get across. Election Night will be more like Election Week because of the extra time it takes to count mail ballots. If it’s a blowout in either direction it might be clearer. But in this age of polarization, the Biden campaign and Trump campaign have both indicated they expect a fairly tight race. Senator Cory Booker is up. Booker was also one of Biden’s rivals in the Democratic primary. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
