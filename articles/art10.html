We Need a Federal Elections Agency.<br></h1><p id="artcont">It could make sure laws are fair and consistent everywhere. By Charlotte Hill and Lee Drutman Ms. Hill is a board member of FairVote and RepresentUs. Mr. Drutman is a senior fellow at New America. Despite high turnout, the 2020 election is already proving to be a mess — buried in litigation, and plagued by disinformation that spreads through toxic partisanship. Though the pandemic and this erratic president are stress-testing our election system like never before in recent memory, the challenges of holding a free and fair vote in America have been mounting for decades. Since the early 2000s, court battles over election rules have become constant, while global experts like those with The Economist’s “Democracy Index” have downgraded the quality of American democracy across multiple measures for years. No matter who ends up prevailing, it is clear that Congress needs to establish a federal elections agency to ensure that the voting process is fair, consistent, secure and legitimate — from redistricting to registration to voting technology. Would this be constitutional? In short, absolutely: Article 1, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution explicitly gives Congress broad powers to “make or alter” regulations affecting elections. Current federal regulators — the Election Assistance Commission, which disperses funding to states and makes administration and security recommendations, and the Federal Election Commission, which oversees campaign finance laws — are woefully insufficient. We often talk about elections as if voters across the country are participating in a single event. But the reality is that individual states and counties — and the partisan politicians who run them — largely make their own rules about ease of voting, ballots and district lines. The overall result is that in the 21st century, in the richest democracy in the world, some people must work much harder to exercise their basic right to vote — and even then, their ballot may be less potent than others. Take rules around registration and voting. Some states and cities automatically register voters and proactively mail them their ballots. Other states require people to register weeks in advance of the election and, unless they have a valid excuse for voting absentee, to show up in person at the polls, where they may face long lines, poorly trained poll workers, and unreliable equipment — not to mention the chance of becoming infected with a lethal virus that thrives in crowded indoor environments.
