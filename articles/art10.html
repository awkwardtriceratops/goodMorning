By Elizabeth Bruenig Ms. Bruenig is an Opinion writer. Dave O’Bannon, 62, cast his first presidential ballot, in 1976, for a fellow evangelical — Jimmy Carter. “I fell in love with Jimmy Carter,” he sighed in an October phone call. “I just fell in love with his love of God.” At the time, Mr. O’Bannon was 18 years old, and the Republican campaign to capture the white evangelical vote was just gaining momentum. Mr. O’Bannon was shortly swept up by the party’s alliance with conservative Christians, and for the next four decades he would not cast a single presidential ballot for a Democrat. It seemed like a reasonable bargain for evangelicals, Protestant Christians whose distinctive mix of activism, biblical focus and emphasis on being “born again” makes them unusual. Political objectives could advance evangelicals’ religious convictions — ending abortion, halting the sexual revolution and permitting demonstrations of faith in public settings, like prayer in schools. Theirs was a politics of piety intended to spiritually renew a broadly Christian country that often seemed to lose sight of its moral guideposts. They brought their fervor to a party otherwise concerned with lowering taxes and limiting government reach. The Republican Party would lend their moral aspirations the force of law, and they would be the party’s conscience. Yet as years went by, the salt would lose its savor. Their spiritual political crusade lapsed into worldly partisanship. White evangelicals have now blended so seamlessly into the broader Republican base that adherents and observers say that the label has become more a political than religious one. Electing Republicans has become, for many evangelicals, an end in itself. But that transformation would take time. “I was one of those rabid Republicans in the early ’80s,” Mr. O’Bannon said. He had gone to Washington as an intern for Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma around that time and went on to serve as a city councilman and mayor in Yukon, Okla. He spent time in the tech industry and eventually taught marketing at his alma mater, Southern Nazarene University. He was vehemently opposed to abortion, and the Republican Party was willing to fight it. Yet, by the time he voted for George W. Bush in 2000, something in Mr. O’Bannon had begun to change. “I had a real transformation from the standpoint of — always calling myself a Christian, but I was a hypocrite,” he said. Mr. O’Bannon found himself spending so much time agitating against various issues — like abortion and same-sex marriage — that he spent relatively little time evangelizing. He wanted to present a vision of Christianity that was welcoming, capacious, appealing. The political orthodoxy of white evangelicalism, its style and methods, had driven him far from that. With the careful cadence of a Sunday school teacher, he spoke of the need to follow Christ’s Great Commission, his exhortation to his apostles to make disciples of all nations, baptize believers and teach them God’s commandments. “And I don’t see where the Republican Party and, my gosh, Donald Trump, check hardly any of those boxes,” he said. White evangelicals were not always a Republican auxiliary. Before the 1970s, they were, in the words of a prominent conservative activist, Morton Blackwell, “the largest tract of virgin timber on the political landscape.” They only needed to be cultivated — and eventually harvested — for the Republican cause. Charles Mathewes, professor of religion and politics at the University of Virginia, observed in an unpublished paper he shared with me that evangelicals had formed a vibrant subculture before they formed a voting bloc. Relying on their own institutions — “places like Wheaton College, Calvin College, Fuller Seminary and media forces like Christianity Today,” Dr. Mathewes writes — they had “Christianized their everyday life.” That they were organized and cohesive made them an especially attractive political asset.
