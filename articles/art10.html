By Simon Marks and Abdi Latif Dahir ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — When Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018, he introduced a raft of reforms aimed at helping Ethiopia transition from an authoritarian state to an inclusive democracy, actions that helped win him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019. But his plans have faced resistance — and a particularly daunting challenge came on Wednesday when Ethiopia’s northernmost region of Tigray went ahead and held parliamentary elections that Mr. Abiy has called “unconstitutional” and “illegal.” Officials in Tigray, as well as groups opposed to Mr. Abiy’s rule, had been infuriated when the federal government, citing the coronavirus pandemic, postponed general elections that were supposed to be held in August. The tentative new plan to hold the elections some time in 2021 extended the government’s term by at least nine months. Leaders in the Tigray region and members of opposition groups said they weren’t adequately consulted, and accused Mr. Abiy of a power grab. The standoff in the restive region of Tigray has heightened already bubbling political tensions in Ethiopia, Africa’s second most-populous nation. Mounting insecurity, internal displacement and communal violence have threatened to tear at the multiethnic fabric of Ethiopian society.
