Then they ran into the buzz saw of No. 1 seeds. By Matthew Futterman Anhelina Kalinina thought she had hit the jackpot just by playing in the United States Open. When tennis officials first announced the initial field of 128 total players in the men’s and women’s singles draws, Kalinina did not make the cut. But then, players kept dropping out, mostly because they did not want to deal with the dangers of the coronavirus pandemic and the hassles of traveling, including being confined to a Long Island hotel for several weeks. Players in the U.S. Open had to agree to a lengthy set of restrictions as the tournament’s organizers attempted to create a so-called bubble, an environment that would be mostly self-contained to help prevent the spread of the virus. Kalinina, who lives in Kyiv, Ukraine, kept climbing up the list of alternates. Then, a little more than a week before the tournament, she got in. She flew 5,000 miles, landed in New York last Monday and began practicing the next day. By Thursday, her luck had turned. She drew the No. 1 seed, Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic, as her first-round opponent. Their match lasted 62 minutes, with Pliskova winning 6-4, 6-0.
