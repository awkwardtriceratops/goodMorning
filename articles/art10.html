Not only was the Foley family having dinner together every night, they were together all of the time. “You wake up together, you all have breakfast together, you work together, have lunch together, you have dinner together, you wake up the next morning and you do it again,” said Mr. Foley, who has an 8-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son. Without in-person company meetings, chief executives have instead become regulars at a new type of meeting: the family dinner. For some of the busiest people in the world, the new normal has reshaped life at home. Already, in the past seven months, Mr. Foley, who runs a $35.5 billion business that sells stationary bicycles and treadmills with live-streamed classes, said he credited family dinners with helping his daughter become more mature. “Her personality has blossomed,” he said, “and that’s partly because we’re together as a family, learning from each other.” Decades of research have shown the benefits of regular family meals for children across the socioeconomic spectrum. Children who eat with their parents have bigger vocabularies, receive higher grades and have lower rates of obesity. They are also more resilient and confident, manage stress better and have lower rates of anxiety and behavioral problems. The benefits extend to parents too, Anne Fishel, director of the Massachusetts General Hospital family therapy program and the Family Dinner Project at Harvard University, said, citing a 2018 study published in Preventive Medicine. Of course, executives with the means to afford extra help around the house have had a different pandemic experience than most Americans. Many frontline workers have lost their jobs. Others are struggling to juggle parenting with the new demands of remote work. Dr. Fishel said that some affluent families had, over the course of the pandemic, realized the benefits of doing chores as a family. “What they’re finding is these are the activities that provide ritual routines and the glue of family life,” she said. Homayoun Hatami, a managing partner at McKinsey & Company in Paris, surveyed chief executives for a report on leadership during the pandemic and found that many had begun to set aside time for family dinners. “Cooking with kids and the family — that’s the new downtime,” Mr. Hatami said. “That replaces the airplane nap at takeoff.” Sara Blakely, the chief executive officer and founder of Spanx, which sells sculpting bodysuits and pants, said that two weeks into the pandemic, she realized that she, like many other women, had taken on more of the child care and household responsibilities than her husband had. To remedy that, she and her husband, who have four children under the age of 12, created a list of chores and divided up the tasks. “It made a lot of difference,” she said. She said her family now eats dinner together every night, up from three to four nights a week before the pandemic. Spending more time at home has given her children new insights into who she is not only as their mother, but also as a creator of a business empire, she said. She realized recently that her children had not known she was an inventor, with several patents in her name. “They were like, ‘Well, what do you mean you’re an inventor?’ They think of an inventor as only a man — as being Einstein or Edison,” she said.
