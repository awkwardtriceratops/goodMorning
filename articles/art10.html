By Rachel L. Harris and Lisa Tarchak Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants. Shortly after President Trump and Joe Biden exited the stage, our Opinion writers began dissecting the first presidential debate, highlighting the evening’s most pivotal moments and noting who they thought stood to gain the most. We asked readers to do the same. In just a few hours we were reading thousands of responses from all over the country. “It was more a brawl than a debate,” wrote Rebecca Jessup in Maine. “Trump threw monkey wrenches whenever he could.” According to Jeff Neuman in Santa Rosa, Calif., “Neither displayed confidence or leadership. Biden let himself be goaded into a tit-for-tat game.” Others, like Hannah Callas in Chicago, homed in on specifics amid the hyperbole: “It was a Fox News moderator who asked the first climate change question in 12 years of presidential debates,” she wrote. And for Geordan Gutow in Atlanta, “the contrast between Biden’s calm address to the nation on ballot integrity and Trump’s wild claims about mail-in ballots” could be the thing that sways undecided voters. More observations from our readers, edited for length and clarity, follow. Tell us what you think in the comments section. Rebecca Jessup, Belfast, Maine: I’d say that Biden wins on reason, facts, having plans and making sense. Trump wins on interrupting, flinging insults and taking up as much time as possible. It was more a brawl than a debate because Trump can’t follow directions — never has and never will. Trump threw monkey wrenches whenever he could. He broke the debate, left it in shambles. Charles McComas, Charlotte, N.C.: What debate? I thought it was two old guys at the V.F.W. yelling at each other about politics. John M. Grondelski, Perth Amboy, N.J.: Trump made clear he was not going to be intimidated by convention. Rosemary Feraldi, Columbia, Mo.: It was an interruption match. Joe Biden did what he needed to do. He spoke directly to the American people. He stayed on task. He made his talking points. I would give him this debate. Xiaoting Xu, Brooklyn, N.Y.: Joe Biden. He outperformed my expectations and won my millennial heart with meme-able moments like calling Trump “Putin’s puppy.” Gail Zoppa, New London, Wis.: Trump refused to stand up to white supremacy. In fact, Trump called on the “Proud Boys” to stand by and be ready. To me, this is encouraging violence.
