By Livia Albeck-Ripka DARWIN, Australia — An Australian and a Briton working to map a deadly legacy of unexploded munitions from World War II have been killed in the South Pacific nation of the Solomon Islands after a bomb they were working on detonated. The blast occurred on Sunday inside the house that the two explosives experts were sharing in a suburb of the capital, Honiara. The police and the humanitarian group they worked for, Norwegian People’s Aid, expressed shock that the men had removed the munition from the field and taken it to a residential area. “We determine what to do with the UXOs after the survey has located them,” Clifford Tunuki, the police inspector, said of the unexploded ordnance in a statement released on Sunday. An official investigation is underway, and the site is being treated as a crime scene, he added. It was unclear whether nearby homes were damaged. Per Hakon Breivik, the aid organization’s director of disarmament, said that he had known one of the men, Stephen Atkinson, 57, of Britain, for more than 20 years, and that Mr. Atkinson and the other bomb expert, Trent Lee, 40, of Australia, were “devoted” professionals. Mr. Breivik said that his group did not have information about why the ordnance was in their home, though he voiced alarm at their actions. He added that the aid group’s activities in the Solomon Islands had been suspended. The deaths have brought to light a perilous heritage hidden in the sandy earth of the Solomon Islands, an archipelago about 1,000 miles northeast of Australia that was the site of fierce fighting between Japanese and Allied forces. The islands, including the main island of Guadalcanal, are still littered with shells and bombs left behind. In the 75 years since the war ended, dozens of people in the Solomon Islands are believed to have been killed or maimed by the munitions, but a lack of funding has impeded removal efforts. “Every single place that was either garrisoned or fought over has got some sort of dangerous legacy,” said John Rodsted, the lead researcher with SafeGround, an advocacy group for the removal of explosives left behind by war. The organization has made several research trips to the Solomon Islands but was not involved with the current mapping effort.
