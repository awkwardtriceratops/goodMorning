I guess that’s a perverse kind of luck. By Annabelle Gurwitch Ms. Gurwitch is the author of the forthcoming “You’re Leaving When? Adventures in Downward Mobility.” LOS ANGELES — This summer, I walked into an urgent care clinic for a coronavirus test and walked out with stage four metastatic lung cancer. There’s a medical term for an unanticipated finding unrelated to the original medical inquiry; it’s called an “incidentaloma.” I was one of the estimated one-third of Americans who avoided doctor visits during the pandemic, either out of fear of the virus or concern for the cost. I had ignored a minor but persistent cough for both reasons and it was only because my health care provider wasn’t offering testing and the lines were so long at the Dodger Stadium drive-through testing site that I walked into a random urgent care in a mini-mall where I was talked into the X-ray — something I assumed to be the urgent care equivalent of a cosmetic counter upsell — that led to my diagnosis. My 22-year-old child and I were on our way home when the car broke down. My phone rang as we waited for a tow on a dusty shoulder of the freeway. “I’m so sorry.” It was the urgent care doctor. “I told you that your X-ray was fine, but I read the wrong scan. You have a concerning mass on your lung.” It took over two months of speculation, scans, antibiotics and higher-level scans of something the size of an olive that doctors thought could be an old pneumonia lesion or another minor affliction. I was rooting for valley fever, a fungal infection that usually resolves on its own and sounded festive, like something that Moon Unit Zappa sang about in the ’80s. Finally I learned it was a malignant tumor the size of a clementine, with cancerous nodes in both lungs. When something goes citrus, that’s a bad sign.
