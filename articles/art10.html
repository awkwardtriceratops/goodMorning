But There’s Good News, Too.<br></h1><p id="artcont">In the long lines of voters, I see hope. By Nell Irvin Painter Nell Irvin Painter is the author of “The History of White People.” My people are wringing their hands and tearing their hair out over the early presidential election returns: How could it be so close? After all we’ve been through, with the lying and the white nationalists and the children in cages and the 230,000-plus dead from Covid-19, how could tens of millions of our fellow citizens still have voted for Mr. Trump? I don’t know, though I nod along with some of the guesses: white resentment, evangelical Christianity, macho-masculinity, anti-abortion, the fate of retirement accounts and restaurant jobs. This question and its possible answers were not upmost in my mind’s eye, for I focused on images of voters, of all political beliefs, queuing up in circumstances as varied as rain in Georgia, cold in Montana and heat in Arizona. Older people with their walkers standing patiently for hours. Indigenous Americans on horseback riding 10 miles to vote. Parents, their kids on their shoulders. Lines stretching for blocks, nearly as long as the lines of cars at food pantries a few months ago. The vertical shapes of Americans standing in wait to vote one after another, in their masks and, for the most part, socially distanced. An estimated 100 million voters cast their votes early, with rounds of applause often greeting first-time voters. These images of this U.S. election seemed familiar to me, but foreign, recalling other elections in other places, such as South Africa in 1994 at the ending of apartheid. South Africans stood with stunning patience, outdoors in the elements, as though voting expressed an existential need that overrode bodily comfort. What was I witnessing now? Americans in 2020 re-enacting the South African voters of 1994? In my visual imagination, images of such determined voters come mostly from other places. The important exceptions are Southern — the American South in the 1960s, where Black voters stood in bunched-up lines in Birmingham and Selma, Ala., to cast votes after the bloody, yearslong campaign for civil rights and the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In serried ranks, the opposite of our Covid-19 distancing, they squeezed into newly accessible civic spaces. The American historian in me can reach farther back to envision determined voting, to Reconstruction, to the image on the cover of Harper’s Weekly of November 1867, with A. R. Waud’s illustration of Black men lined up to deposit ballots into partisan urns.
