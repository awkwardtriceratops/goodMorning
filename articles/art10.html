By Benjamin Weiser and William K. Rashbaum President Trump on Tuesday won another delay in the long-running legal battle over whether he must turn over eight years of tax returns to the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which subpoenaed them a year ago in a criminal investigation focused on Mr. Trump, his business and his associates. In a brief order, a federal appeals court in New York said it would temporarily block a grand jury subpoena issued by the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a Democrat, while it considers Mr. Trump’s arguments that the request was “wildly overbroad” and politically motivated. The ruling is the latest development in the president’s aggressive effort to keep his tax returns and other financial records out of the hands of prosecutors, Congress and others — a dispute that has reached the United States Supreme Court once and is almost certain to end up there again. With an election looming, the ruling means that, as a practical matter, prosecutors will not receive Mr. Trump’s records for at least another month, and perhaps longer if the president seeks a review in the Supreme Court. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
