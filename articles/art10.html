By Sopan Deb and Marc Stein RIGHT NOW The Lakers lead Miami in the first quarter, 16-11. The Los Angeles Lakers are one win away from a championship in their N.B.A. finals series against the Miami Heat. A win would give the Lakers a record-tying 17th championship, but the Heat have shown their resilience and, especially in Jimmy Butler’s case, their relentlessness in the face of daunting odds. But the Lakers’ LeBron James, who is going for his fourth ring, and Anthony Davis, who is going for his first, are motivated to end the series tonight. Who: Lakers (3-1) vs. Heat (1-3) When: 9 p.m. Eastern time Where to watch: ABC Click here to refresh for live updates. The Lakers will be wearing their ‘Mamba’ jerseys, a black version with a snakeskin pattern in honor of the former franchise great Kobe Bryant, who died in a helicopter crash in January. Miami will again be without guard Goran Dragic, who tore the plantar fascia ligament in his left foot in Game 1 and has been out since. He tried to warm up before Game 4 but was not able to play. Bam Adebayo, who injured his neck in Game 1 and missed two games, was back for Game 4. He is in the starting lineup tonight. By Sopan Deb China Central Television, the state-run TV network, announced Friday that it would televise an N.B.A. game for the first time since a dispute with the league began last fall after a team executive expressed support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The move suggested a softening of tensions between the N.B.A. and China that the league estimated had cost it hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and that elicited criticism from fans and politicians. The change was to begin with Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat on Friday night.
