By Tracey Tully Most children born in New Jersey would be entitled to a $1,000 state-financed nest egg under a proposal that Gov. Philip D. Murphy announced on Tuesday in a bid to narrow a widening wealth gap. The idea to give out the so-called baby bonds is a scaled-down version of legislation introduced by Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, to help address a disparity that, on average, has left white families in the United States seven times wealthier than their Black counterparts. The New Jersey initiative, which Mr. Murphy’s aides believe is the first state effort of its kind, would cost an estimated $80 million a year and would require legislative approval. The $1,000 allocation, payable with interest when a child turns 18, is included in the amended state budget that Mr. Murphy released on Tuesday. Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, said the move would be a small but tangible step toward confronting inequities that have been brought into particularly stark relief by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected Black and Latino people, who have died and lost jobs at far higher rates. “The inequities are too wide, too raw, to ignore,” Mr. Murphy said in an interview. The initiative would apply to children born into families earning less than about $131,000 a year, or 500 percent of the federal poverty level — about 70 percent of all New Jersey residents, an aide to Mr. Murphy said. At an average rate of growth equivalent to Monday’s 30-year bond rate of 1.35 percent, the investment would be worth about $1,270 after 18 years. The legislation introduced by Mr. Booker and Representative Ayanna Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, would add more money to a child’s account each year, creating a fund of about $46,000 for children born into the poorest families. The idea of creating such nest eggs has been discussed at least as far back as 2007, when Hillary Clinton, during her first presidential campaign, proposed setting aside $5,000 at birth to be used to pay for college or buy a house. “The source of inequality generally is that some young adults have capital and others do not,” said Darrick Hamilton, a professor of economics and urban policy who will begin teaching at The New School in New York City next month. “The difference between a renter and a homeowner is a down payment.” “This is saying: Irrespective to the family you are born into, that you have a birthright to capital when you become an adult,” Professor Hamilton added. The gap in wealth between the richest Americans and the middle class has grown rapidly in the last 50 years. The financial disparities between white and Black people are also glaring. The median wealth for white families is about $171,000, compared with just $17,600 for Black families. Much of that wealth is passed down from one generation to the next.
