This year, with no fans in the seats, there is chatter galore between coaches and players, even though it breaks the rules. By Matthew Futterman The prohibition against coaching during a match at the United States Open is supposed to be straightforward. “Coaching is considered to be communication, advice or instruction of any kind and by any means to a player,” Article III, Section L states on page 44 of the 2020 Official Grand Slam Rule Book. This year, not so much. At this tournament, the strict prohibition is largely being ignored, two years after it prompted one of the most contentious moments in recent U.S. Open history — a harsh confrontation at the 2018 women’s final when the chair umpire issued a code violation to Serena Williams for receiving coaching. Because of the lack of ticket-buying spectators, coaches have been among the few people watching matches, and chatter with their players has become one of the unforeseen consequences of staging a Grand Slam tournament in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. The stadiums are silent and nearly empty. The players have no one else to turn to for support during the pressure cooker of one of the world’s biggest tournaments. There are fewer umpires to police violations. And, in some cases, masks hide the moving lips of each coach. The resulting combination is plenty of communication — sometimes in both directions — between the players and the people most important to their success.
