By Margaux Laskey Whether you’re serving a full table or just a few, you will find all the recipes and how-to guides you need on NYT Cooking to host a memorable Thanksgiving dinner. We’ll help you with planning (building a menu, accommodating special diets) with our guide on how to cook and plan Thanksgiving. When you’re ready to choose your dishes, check out our interactive Thanksgiving menu planner. If you just want to browse, here are hundreds of our best Thanksgiving recipes. (For those with special diets, we’ve compiled our best vegan Thanksgiving recipes, vegetarian Thanksgiving recipes and gluten-free Thanksgiving recipes.) View our collections of Thanksgiving Recipes, Vegan Thanksgiving Recipes, Vegetarian Recipes,  and Gluten-Free Thanksgiving Recipes. Or see how columnist Melissa Clark takes on the holiday. It’s all about the bird. Go classic with a simple roast turkey. You can never go wrong with our dry-brined turkey or Samin Nosrat’s buttermilk-brined spatchcocked turkey. If you’re feeding a small crew, or want leftover turkey for sandwiches, make Samin’s turkey breast version (or a simple roast turkey breast recipe). For more tips on roasting turkey, including cooking times, check out our how to cook turkey guide. Also, when the big day arrives, you’ll need to know how to carve a turkey. Study up! By all means, do not forget the gravy. Here are our Thanksgiving gravy recipes (including Sam Sifton’s turkey gravy with drippings), and here is our how to make gravy guide. View our collections of Thanksgiving Turkey Recipes and Thanksgiving Gravy Recipes, and our How to Cook Turkey guide, How to Make Gravy guide and How to Carve a Turkey video. Sides are arguably the best part of the Thanksgiving table. Take the traditional route with green bean casserole, candied yams, mashed potatoes, sweet potato casserole, corn casserole and stuffing. (We have a vegan stuffing, too.) You could also make baked macaroni and cheese, roasted carrots, candied sweet potatoes or southern cornbread dressing. One of our most popular Thanksgiving recipes year after year is Mark Bittman’s roasted brussels sprouts with garlic (above). It’s truly the only brussels sprouts recipe you’ll ever need, but don’t worry: We have more — and even a whole guide dedicated to the little vegetables. View our collections of Thanksgiving Side Dish Recipes, Thanksgiving Potato Recipes, Thanksgiving Sweet Potato Recipes, Thanksgiving Butternut Squash Recipes, Thanksgiving Brussels Sprouts Recipes, Stuffing and Dressing Recipes for Thanksgiving, Make-Ahead Thanksgiving Recipes and Thanksgiving Potluck Ideas and Recipes. Love it or hate it, cranberry sauce adds a much-needed jolt of color and flavor that cuts through the rich, very brown food on the Thanksgiving table. Sam Sifton’s cranberry sauce (above) is as classic as it gets, and it’s just four ingredients: fresh cranberries, sugar, orange juice and zest. For a fresher taste, whiz fresh cranberries, a whole orange (rind and all), a handful of pecans and honey in a food processor for a crunchy cranberry orange relish. If Thanksgiving is the one time each year you trot out your Jell-O mold, Julia Moskin’s cranberry-orange jelly is here for you.
