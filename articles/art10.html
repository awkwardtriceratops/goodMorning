By Adam Liptak WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court announced on Friday that it would hear a case on whether the Trump administration can exclude undocumented immigrants from the calculations it will use in apportioning congressional seats. The court put the case on a fast track, saying it will hear arguments on Nov. 30. Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump’s Supreme Court pick, will most likely be on the court by then. The announcement followed an order by the court on Tuesday allowing the administration to cut short the 2020 census count. The administration had said it needed to do so to meet a deadline for submitting its tabulations by the end of the year, allowing President Trump to control the process even if he loses the November election. The case the court agreed to hear on Friday concerns whether those tabulations should include undocumented immigrants. If the court rules for the administration, it would upend a consensus that the census must count all residents, whatever their immigration status, and would generally shift both political power and federal money from Democratic states to Republican ones.
