Speech From Israel, With Eye Toward 2024<br></h1><p id="artcont">No sitting secretary of state has addressed a national political convention in at least 75 years. By Lara Jakes [What to watch for tonight at the Republican National Convention.] WASHINGTON — In planning to address the Republican Party faithful on Tuesday night from one of the world’s holiest cities, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is betting that he has more to gain politically than he would lose by challenging decades of diplomatic decorum. Mr. Pompeo is scheduled to speak to the Republican National Convention in a pretaped speech from Jerusalem, with the lights of the Old City and its Jewish, Muslim and Christian shrines expected to be visible over his shoulder. It provides him with a vantage point to praise one of President Trump’s few foreign policy achievements that has received wide and bipartisan support: the normalization of diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. It also gives him a national platform with Mr. Trump’s core supporters — a political base that Mr. Pompeo is courting as he weighs a future presidential campaign. “If he has any interest in running for president in the future, this is a way of inserting himself into presidential politics, but at the cost of breaking an important tradition in American history,” said Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian. Mr. Pompeo has been under criticism since it became clear several days ago that he would be giving the speech while on an official diplomatic trip to the Middle East and North Africa. It will be the first time in at least 75 years, by Mr. Beschloss’s count, that a sitting secretary of state has addressed a national convention to nominate a party’s presidential candidate. “And that was not by accident,” Mr. Beschloss said. “There was a feeling that foreign policy should be sacrosanct, and that secretaries of state should not be mixing that directly in domestic politics.”
