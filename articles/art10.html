By Derrick Bryson Taylor and Marie Fazio Hurricane Delta intensified into a Category 4 storm on Tuesday and was expected to remain “extremely dangerous” as it reaches Mexico by early Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The storm, the ninth named hurricane of the season, was about 180 miles east-southeast of Cozumel, Mexico, the center said. As of Tuesday night, Delta had maximum sustained winds of 145 miles per hour with higher gusts. The government of Mexico had issued a hurricane warning from Tulum to Dzilam and Cozumel, the center said, and tropical storm warnings were in effect for a portion of western Cuba, Isle of Youth, Punta Herrero to Tulum, and Dzilam to Progresso. Government officials ordered nonessential businesses to close as emergency crews helped evacuate inhabitants from low-lying coastal areas to storm shelters. “It’s ideal conditions for rapid intensification — warm water temperatures, negligible wind chill,” said Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist and spokesman for the National Hurricane Center. “This has turned into a very dangerous, very serious hurricane.” The brunt of the storm will hit the Yucatán Peninsula first, he said. Residents across the region scrambled on Tuesday to prepare for the storm’s arrival, stocking up on days’ worth of groceries, hardware materials and gasoline, and pulling boats from the water and moving them to higher ground. Scores of hotels along the Caribbean coast, including popular tourist destinations like Cancún, Playa del Carmen and Tulum, were moving their guests to shelters.
