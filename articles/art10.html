But in Which Direction?<br></h1><p id="artcont">The picks are a repudiation of President Trump’s isolationism, but they will have to resolve tensions between an Obama-era approach and the “fresh thinking” the president-elect says he wants. TRANSCRIPT Experience and leadership, fresh thinking and perspective, and an unrelenting belief in the promise of America. I’ve long said that America leads not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. And I’m proud to put forward this incredible team. Mr. President-elect, working for you, having you as a mentor and friend has been the greatest privilege of my professional life. So many people have brought me to this day. Please know that I will work day and night in the service of our nation to ably lead the men and women of the United States Department of Homeland Security, and to bring honor to my parents and to the trust you have placed in me to carry your vision for our country forward. Such a tremendous honor. If afforded the opportunity to do so, I will never forget that my role on this team is unique. Better than that of a policy adviser, I will represent to you, Congress and the American public the patriots who comprise our intelligence community. In the years that I’ve worked in government, I’m always struck by how only in America would we be where we are today, where life can be hard and cruel, but there is hope in the struggle, there is promise in our dreams, where you learn to believe in yourself and that anything is possible. I pledge to you and to the American people that I will work relentlessly in service of the mission you have given us, to keep our country and our people safe, to advance our national interests and to defend our values. Mr President-elect, you’ve put forward a bold, transformative climate plan. But you’ve also underscored that no country alone can solve this challenge. I’ve come to know firsthand the gravity of the challenges and threats facing the United States. And over the past few months, I’ve also come to know the sound judgment, expertise and character of the people on this stage. I can say with confidence that they are, to a person, the right women and men for these critical positions.
