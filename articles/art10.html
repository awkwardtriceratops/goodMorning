But there are changes taxpayers can make now, financial advisers say. By Paul Sullivan In unpredictable times, the desire to create a better tax strategy becomes more urgent, but that could result in some regrettable changes to perfectly good plans. For example, many advisers counseled their wealthy clients in 2012 that the estate and gift taxes exemptions were going down and that the rates on those taxes were going up. But the opposite happened the next year, and people who had given away more than they might have otherwise were caught off guard. This year, few respectable financial advisers are handicapping the election and what it might mean for taxes and investment returns next year. But that doesn’t mean they are not providing counsel. “We can’t make predictions better than anyone else can,” said Ani C. Hovanessian, chair of the New York Tax and Wealth Planning Group at Venable, a law firm. “But if we fail to plan, we plan to fail. Individuals aren’t going to work with me because we’re frozen like a deer in the headlights.” Here’s a look at different planning strategies that taxpayers may want to embrace, avoid or even hedge, all with an acknowledgment that no one knows what next year will bring. The main criterion for committing to a new plan now is that it is something you would have done eventually. Adjustments should not be something that springs to mind out of fear of the November election. One easy change is converting an individual retirement account to a Roth retirement account. The money in a traditional I.R.A. is taxed when it is taken out. With a Roth I.R.A., you pay the tax on the deposits, and the money grows tax free. But a conversion requires the tax to be paid now, which can be a hard check to write, even if the long-term gain is better. There are ways to offset the tax owed by claiming a loss this year. People who own rental properties that have generated passive income, or revenue that requires little to no effort to earn, can depreciate the value of the property and use that to offset the tax owed on a Roth conversion, said Stephen A. Baxley, director of tax and financial planning at Bessemer Trust. Another simple change involves charitable giving. A provision in the CARES Act allows for 100 percent of charitable donations made in cash to be counted against your income this year. Normally, the deduction is capped at 50 percent of your income, with any amount more than that carried forward to subsequent years. The provision was meant to spur immediate giving during the pandemic. But there are ways to comply with the spirit of the provision and not give entirely in cash. Mr. Baxley said taxpayers could give 30 percent of their income in long-term appreciated stock and top that off with 70 percent in cash. Or they could also give 60 percent in cash to a donor-advised fund — which allows them to make grants at a later time — and 40 percent in cash to a public charity. Pairing these charitable contributions with a Roth conversion can also offset the cost, he said. Giving to heirs before the end of the year also makes sense as a tax strategy, said Jeremy Geller, co-head of J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. And as the exemption level goes up each year, he advises clients to top the gift off annually. In a tax overhaul passed by Republican lawmakers in 2017, the exemption on the estate tax was doubled to more than $23 million for a couple (with a 40 percent tax rate on any amount over that). But that benefit expires in 2025. One concern among wealthy taxpayers is that a Democratic sweep on Election Day could bring that date forward, lowering the exemption amount back to what it was in the Obama era and increasing tax rates to pay for the ballooning federal deficit. Whether that will happen is hard to predict, so advisers are counseling clients to make big tax-free gifts now only if they were planning to do so anyway. Julio Castro, a partner and wealth and fiduciary adviser at Evercore Wealth Management, said he feared “impetuous planning.” “We don’t want people freaking out ahead of the election and implementing planning strategies that don’t make sense for them,” Mr. Castro said. “There’s always a chance that things will change.”
