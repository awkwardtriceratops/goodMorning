Climate Change Might Be Why.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Scientists say that climate change, which has also contributed to the wildfires on the West Coast, helped intensify a storm that is unleashing a deluge in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi. By Richard Fausset, Rick Rojas and Henry Fountain [Follow our live Hurricane Sally updates and our map tracker.] BAYOU LA BATRE, Ala. — Hurricane Sally parked itself over the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, churning slowly and lumbering at a sluggish pace toward land, representing a climate change reality that has made many hurricanes wetter, slower and more dangerous. Sally’s outer bands unleashed a relentless rain that began in the morning and continued unabated all day and into the night, threatening to deluge coastal communities in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi. Meteorologists worried — and almost marveled — as the storm pushed forward at a speed of just 2 miles per hour, shifting erratically in its path and intensity. Scientists saw Sally’s stall over the warm waters of the Gulf as yet another effect of climate change in the United States, coming as wildfires along the West Coast have incinerated millions of acres and sent foul air into the atmosphere as far away as Washington, D.C. A scorching summer — made worse by the burning of fossil fuels, experts say — led to dry conditions that helped turn this year’s wildfires into the worst ever recorded.
