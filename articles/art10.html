They don’t fit neatly into partisan stereotypes. By Reid J. Epstein Jennifer Mintun is a Catholic stay-at-home mother in Denver, N.C., who thinks there should be more restrictions on abortion rights. But she’s worried that Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, may go too far in opposing abortion and same-sex marriage. “I do have a gay brother, and that is very important to me that he doesn’t feel stripped of any rights,” said Ms. Mintun, 31, who is undecided in the presidential race but leaning toward voting for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Charlene Bowden, 80, is a retired nurse from Eddington, Me., who strongly favors abortion rights but feels Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh was treated unfairly during his 2018 confirmation hearings and is leaning toward voting for Mr. Trump. Now she fears that Democratic opposition to Judge Barrett will tear the country apart. “The people that are in the country now that are leftist, they don’t seem to understand the danger of all of this derision,” she said. Yet she added: “I have a hard time with a bunch of old white men deciding what I should do with my body when it comes to abortion issues. Why should they decide?” Interviews since Sunday with more than two dozen voters who are still making up their minds in the presidential contest showed a set of Americans weighing how they should react to the looming Supreme Court fight. For many of these voters, their feelings about Judge Barrett and the selection process do not fit neatly into partisan stereotypes or narratives, with some supporters of abortion rights backing her nomination and some otherwise Democratic-leaning voters saying Mr. Trump had the right to select Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s replacement. Rather, the voters expressed a range of nuanced and often personal reasons for their opinions about Judge Barrett, and by extension Mr. Trump and his re-election effort. On the eve of Tuesday’s presidential debate, few of the undecided voters exhibited firm opinions about Judge Barrett herself, but nearly all of them felt strongly about whether Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans should push to confirm her before the election, with the divide not necessarily correlating to which candidate they are leaning toward supporting. Andrew Sperry, a conservative government contractor from Las Vegas, voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 but has soured on him since. “You’re going to find few people where the Supreme Court justice pick specifically is going to sway their vote,” said Mr. Sperry, 41. “What you’ll find more is the fact that the Senate is trying to rush it through makes it dirty.”
