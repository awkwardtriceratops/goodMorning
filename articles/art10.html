But Will They Send Their Children to School?<br></h1><p id="artcont">So far, nearly 40 percent of families have opted to have their children learn fully remotely when public schools reopen on Sept. 21. By Eliza Shapiro Adriana Aviles has been holding dress rehearsals for the first day of school. Her three children wear face masks in their Queens home all day, every other day, to practice for when they return to school buildings in a few weeks. Ms. Aviles says her children cannot wait to go back to school, and she is frustrated that the city recently delayed the start date by nearly two weeks, to Sept. 21. “We’ll get some normalcy hopefully, and God willing we’ll be OK,” she said of the return to school. “We practiced what we need to practice.” Across the city, in Harlem, Lisandra Sanchez recently delivered some disappointing news to her son, a rising high school freshman: She did not think it was safe for him to physically attend school because some classes might be held outdoors. She is worried about crime around the building, so she opted her son out of in-person learning. “In the community where I live at, it’s not really safe,” Ms. Sanchez said. New York City, home to the nation’s largest school district, is poised to be the only big city in the country to offer in-person education at the start of its school year. Mayor Bill de Blasio has faced resistance from some educators and politicians in his bid to reopen classrooms, but has said he is determined to bring children back into school buildings to support the city’s overwhelmingly Black, Latino and low-income student body. Students who decide to return to classrooms will report to school between one and three days a week to allow for social distancing. “I have heard the voices of thousands and thousands of parents over the years,” Mr. de Blasio said in a recent interview. “They need this,” he said of in-person instruction, “and it’s our obligation to give it to them.” Yet many parents said they were exhausted from a summer of conflicting information and last-minute changes on school reopening, particularly the mayor’s recent decision to delay the start of the school year just 10 days before school buildings were scheduled to open. Nearly 40 percent of parents have opted to have their children learn fully remotely through at least the first few months of the school year. That number, which could grow before the start of classes, reflects the deep divide among the city’s families about how to approach in-person learning.
