By Sopan Deb and Marc Stein RIGHT NOW The Lakers lead Miami in the first quarter, 16-11. The Los Angeles Lakers are one win away from a championship in their N.B.A. finals series against the Miami Heat. A win would give the Lakers a record-tying 17th championship, but the Heat have shown their resilience and, especially in Jimmy Butler’s case, their relentlessness in the face of daunting odds. But the Lakers’ LeBron James, who is going for his fourth ring, and Anthony Davis, who is going for his first, are motivated to end the series tonight. Who: Lakers (3-1) vs. Heat (1-3) When: 9 p.m. Eastern time Where to watch: ABC Click here to refresh for live updates. The Lakers will be wearing their ‘Mamba’ jerseys, a black version with a snakeskin pattern in honor of the former franchise great Kobe Bryant, who died in a helicopter crash in January. Miami will again be without guard Goran Dragic, who tore the plantar fascia ligament in his left foot in Game 1 and has been out since. He tried to warm up before Game 4 but was not able to play. Bam Adebayo, who injured his neck in Game 1 and missed two games, was back for Game 4. He is in the starting lineup tonight. By Sopan Deb China Central Television, the state-run TV network, announced Friday that it would televise an N.B.A. game for the first time since a dispute with the league began last fall after a team executive expressed support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The move suggested a softening of tensions between the N.B.A. and China that the league estimated had cost it hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and that elicited criticism from fans and politicians. The change was to begin with Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat on Friday night. “On the morning of October 10, the channel of CCTV Sports will broadcast the fifth game of the N.B.A. finals,” the network said in a post in Chinese on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform. “Welcome everyone to watch at the time!” Find out why China made the change now. Before the season, Marc Stein talked to Butler about his road to stardom in the N.B.A. Butler has done a lot of changing since his arrival in the N.B.A. as the 30th overall pick of the Chicago Bulls in 2011. He blossomed into a four-time All-Star with a reputation as a hypercompetitive and demanding teammate, unafraid to also challenge coaches, team executives, whomever. In an interview with Yahoo Sports last season, Butler acknowledged that he could rightly be described as “confrontational.” He has also described himself as “a little extra at times.” Butler said he does what he wants, despite what people may think of him. As he prepares to begin his new work life with the Heat, Butler is pushing back harder against those around the N.B.A. who have criticized him for how much he has changed from his early days in the league. Back then, he was known as a coach-pleaser who liked to accentuate his Texas roots by wearing cowboy boots and oversize belt buckles, and listening to country music. “I like it,” Butler said of the knock that he has changed too much. “I am different. I’ve picked up a lot of different hobbies. I don’t want to stay the same. “I do what makes me happy. Some people just don’t like it. Some people just don’t want people to be happy.” Read more: By Marc Stein This has never been the month that basketball players were meant to peak. October is for baseball glory, and there can only be one Mr. October. By swatting three home runs on three swings in Game 6 of the 1977 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Reggie Jackson cemented one of the most fitting, enduring nicknames in all of sports. In 2020, of course, little proceeds as we expected. LeBron James is chasing one more win for his fourth N.B.A. championship at Walt Disney World at the same time Jackson’s beloved Yankees are scuffling with the Tampa Bay Rays in the American League Divisional Series at a neutral site in San Diego. The schedule glut across so many sports has posed an unexpected quandary for Mr. October, since Jackson is also an unabashed LeBron James fan. “I enjoy watching him as much as I do the baseball,” Jackson said. “The basketball is winding down, so if they’re both on at the same time, I’m going to be flipping back to baseball, because I’m going to be on the basketball. You need to see this guy.” Click here to read more, including whether Jackson thinks James is the G.O.A.T. If the Los Angeles Lakers beat Miami in the finals, LeBron James and Danny Green can join John Salley and Robert Horry on the short list of players to win championships with three different franchises. James is also bidding to become the first player to win the N.B.A. finals Most Valuable Player Award with three different teams. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
