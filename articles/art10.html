By Phillip Atiba Goff Dr. Goff is a professor of African-American studies and psychology at Yale University and co-founder and C.E.O. of the Center for Policing Equity.

Since this spring, when Americans watched George Floyd take his last breaths as Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck, we’ve borne witness to the worst that this country’s criminal justice system has to offer: continued extrajudicial killings, failure to hold officers accountable and state-sponsored violence against those standing up for justice. It’s hard to imagine that things could get worse. But draft recommendations from a Trump-appointed policing commission prove that they could. In October 2019, President Trump signed an executive order to establish a commission that Attorney General William P. Barr explained was intended to make the police “trusted and effective guardians of our communities.” From the beginning, its membership — made up entirely of law enforcement — spoke volumes about its intentions. A lawsuit brought by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund argued that the commission makeup violated federal law and this month, a federal judge agreed. He ordered the commission to halt its proceedings, including the release of the report, until it can meet the Federal Advisory Committee Act’s requirement that demands “fairly balanced” viewpoints aired in publicly noticed, open meetings. But the recommendations drafted before this month’s ruling, first reported by Reuters, nonetheless provide a frightening window into the administration’s vision for law enforcement. I say this without exaggeration: The president’s commission was considering recommendations that could transform this nation into a dystopian police state. In May, my colleagues at the Center for Policing Equity and I were asked to give testimony to the commission. We wrote that a more equitable system of policing can be built only when the police are worthy of trust, not fear. We emphasized the need for more transparency and robust data, not less. And we explained why politicizing law enforcement is dangerous: If communities fear that their safety is contingent on their political beliefs, the trust required for public safety is irreparably harmed. To be clear, some live under those conditions now. But a federal push further in that direction would pour lighter fluid on those burning problems.
