President Trump still struggled for an answer on the coronavirus and Joe Biden waved away character attacks with a “Come on, man!” By Shane Goldmacher President Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. engaged in more than 90 minutes of actual debate on Thursday. It was civil, calm, sedate, substantive (at times) and, almost, even normal. None of those words could be used to describe their first clash, in Cleveland. But Mr. Trump, chastened by Republicans for his over-aggressive performance last month, arrived in what was, for him, restrained fashion as he tried to reinvigorate his flagging campaign. But his relatively subdued performance seemed unlikely to be enough to shift the trajectory of a race that has been unmoved by far larger world events. Here are six takeaways from the final 2020 presidential debate. After the first-debate debacle, the debate commission imposed a mute feature for the opening statements of both candidates for each segment. It helped. But Mr. Trump mostly muzzled his own impulse for interruption. He verbally stopped himself short of directly discussing how Mr. Biden’s son Hunter exited the military. And he even praised Kristen Welker, the debate moderator from NBC who kept tight control on the proceedings, saying, “So far, I respect very much the way you’re handling this.” The lack of cross-talk allowed viewers to actually discern the differences between the two candidates, on the pandemic, on climate change, on systemic racism, on charting an economic recovery, on federal spending and on health care. For Mr. Trump, who advisers believe needs the race to be a clear choice between himself and Mr. Biden, the set of contrasts came late — in only the final debate of three on the schedule, after he bulldozed through the first one and his contracting of the coronavirus set in motion the cancellation of the second one.
