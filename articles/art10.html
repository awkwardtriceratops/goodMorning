By Deborah L. Jacobs On a recent foggy morning, Brandon Woolf was sitting on a foldable chair, in front of a foldable table, next to a Brooklyn mailbox, writing letters on a 1940s-vintage portable Royal typewriter. He was dressed in a navy blue T-shirt emblazoned with the U.S. Postal Service logo. A chalkboard sign in front of him explained the project to passers-by: “Free Letters for Friends Feeling Blue.” Mr. Woolf, 37, doesn’t work for the post office; he’s a performance artist with a doctorate, on the full-time faculty of New York University. In addition to teaching two courses via Zoom and directing the Program in Dramatic Literature for undergraduates, he is currently doing a sidewalk piece called “The Console.” That’s shorthand for “consolation.” Inspired by the somewhat antiquated tradition of writing condolence notes, Mr. Woolf helps draft letters to be mailed in the box a few feet from his makeshift desk, on the corner of Fourth Street and Prospect Park West. Now in its fourth week, “The Console,” which he describes as “post-dramatic theater,” will continue through Monday. It’s timed to coincide with “the heightened anxiety” surrounding the election, he said.
