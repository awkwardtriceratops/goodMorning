By Gail Collins Opinion Columnist Hey, it looks like Donald Trump is running out of money. Stop applauding. The Times’s Shane Goldmacher and Maggie Haberman reported this week that just as the presidential race is steaming into high gear, the Trump campaign has frittered away more than $800 million of the $1.1 billion it raised since the start of 2019. The money went to much-needed initiatives like $11 million in reservations for Super Bowl ads. A great investment! Look what it did for Michael Bloomberg. The Biden campaign — which raised way more money than Trump in August, seems to be spending a lot less. Do you sniff disastrous ineptitude in the Republican air? Think of it this way: This election is the Trump family’s new version of their Atlantic City casinos. Or: The campaign’s finances are structured with all the discipline and care of the Mexican wall project. Or: The president’s campaign projections sound approximately as reliable as his timetable for coronavirus relief. If this keeps up, by late October Donald Jr. and the other kids will be trying to keep the family’s political fortunes afloat with gigs on the rent-a-celebrity circuit. Party planners will have to decide whether their guests would be more impressed rubbing elbows with Jared Kushner or the 2015 winner of “The Bachelor.” To be fair, some Trump supporters are trying to do things more creatively. Just the other day, they had a lovely boat parade on a Texas lake that was perfect except for the part where five boats sank. But if the fund-raising doesn’t pick up, Joe Biden will have a definite advantage for the last leg of the race. That might reduce the suspense, and a Democratic victory might look a little less spectacular — maybe history would just regard the vice president as an average guy who got lucky.
