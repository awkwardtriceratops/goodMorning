By David Leonhardt Want to get The Morning by email? Here’s the sign-up. In the internet’s early days, it seemed to have the potential to crush traditional print media. But its impact has turned out to be more nuanced. The internet has instead been a boon for some publications with a national audience. The New York Times has never had as many subscribers or readers — or employed as many journalists — as it does today. The Atlantic, The Washington Post and some others are also thriving. It’s at the local level that the digital revolution has been as destructive as feared. Hundreds of local news organizations have folded, as their advertising revenue disappears, and the pandemic is exacerbating the crisis. At least 60 local newsrooms have closed since March, according to Poynter. Some of them were more than a century old, like The Eureka Sentinel, in Nevada; The Mineral Wells Index, in Texas; and The Morehead News, in Kentucky. This isn’t a story of creative destruction, in which nimble new entrants replace older companies. Often, nothing replaces a shuttered newsroom, leaving communities without any independent information about local government, schools and businesses. (A recent Times investigation found that some partisan groups have begun posing as local publishers, trying to pass off political propaganda as news.) There are consequences for society. When a community’s newspaper closes, voter turnout and cross-party voting tend to decline, while political corruption and government waste rise, academic research has found. A democracy struggles to function when its citizens can’t stay informed. What can be done? Eventually, savvy entrepreneurs may figure out how to make local news profitable. But several have tried in recent years, without success. For the foreseeable future, the only reliable answer seems to involve philanthropy. Americans have long accepted that the arts, higher education and organized religion all depend on charitable giving. Local journalism is now in the same category. “We need philanthropists across the country to embrace robust local journalism,” Sarabeth Berman, the chief executive of the American Journalism Project, which funds local news sites, told me. “If you care about education, you need to worry if school boards and charter boards are covered. And if you care about the environment, you should make sure reporters like Ken Ward Jr. are covering coal country in West Virginia.” There are many other shining examples of the new nonprofit journalism. But even more communities receive little to no high-quality coverage. I decided to write about this topic this morning, because today is Giving Tuesday, when people take a break from online shopping to focus on charitable giving. If you are worried about the state of local news, you can donate through NewsMatch, which matches donations to local publications, or to your local public-radio affiliate. If you want different giving ideas, try my colleague Nicholas Kristof’s more global suggestions or The Times’s Neediest Cases Fund, which focuses on economic hardship. Moderna says its coronavirus vaccine is more than 94 percent effective, and the company has asked the F.D.A. to authorize it. If all goes smoothly, the drug could begin reaching Americans by Dec. 21. “The long darkness before dawn”: Donald McNeil, a Times reporter who covers infectious diseases, examines the grim months ahead, when virus deaths will almost certainly surge before vaccines are widely available. After weeks of lockdown, new cases in England have fallen by 33 percent. The policy is set to end tomorrow, though some regions will keep tight restrictions. Dr. Scott Atlas, a White House coronavirus adviser who espoused disputed theories, resigned. His term was about to expire this week. “Teachers are not OK right now,” one educator told The Times. The whiplash of closings and reopenings and the stresses of remote learning have driven many in the profession to exhaustion. President-elect Joe Biden’s picks for economic advisers suggest his administration will focus on workers and organized labor, including pushes for a higher minimum wage and a stronger social safety net. It’s unclear how much Biden can accomplish if Republicans keep a Senate majority after the Georgia runoff elections in January. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris received their first President’s Daily Brief, a top-level intelligence report. Previous incoming presidents received their first only days after the election. President Trump has raised about $170 million since Election Day, as his campaign has solicited donations for an “Election Defense Fund.” The cash could also fund his next political move.
