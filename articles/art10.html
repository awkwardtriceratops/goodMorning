Williams also told Congress he raised concerns about Louis DeJoy ahead of his hiring as Postmaster General. By Nicholas Fandos, Catie Edmondson and Alan Rappeport WASHINGTON — The former vice chairman of the U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors accused Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday of politicizing the Postal Service, telling lawmakers that Mr. Mnuchin required members of the independent board to “kiss the ring” before they were confirmed and issued demands agency officials believed were “illegal.” In testimony delivered before lawmakers in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, David C. Williams, a former Postal Service inspector general who resigned as vice chairman in April, detailed why he left the board. His statement to lawmakers accused the Treasury Department of trying to turn the agency into a “political tool.” “By statute the Treasury was made responsible for providing the Postal Service with a line of credit,” Mr. Williams said. “The Treasury was using that responsibility to make demands that I believed would turn the Postal Service into a political tool, ending its long history as an apolitical public infrastructure.” He resigned, he said, because he “was convinced that its independent role had been marginalized and that representations regarding an independent Postal Service for the nation were no longer truthful.” Mr. Mnuchin has been focused on overhauling the Postal Service since 2018, after it became a source of President Trump’s ire. The president believes that Postal Service is essentially subsidizing e-commerce companies such as Amazon and that it must raise shipping prices and strengthen its financial footing. Mr. Trump has publicly feuded with Amazon’s chief executive officer, Jeffrey Bezos. Mr. Mnuchin on Thursday rebutted suggestions that he had done anything but play his proper role as a lender to the Postal Service and in fulfilling his duty to try and help fix its financial woes. Mr. Mnuchin was assigned by Mr. Trump to lead a task force to study ways to reform the Postal Service and in late 2018 released recommendations that detailed changes the White House wanted to see implemented. Many of those changes have since been implemented by the new Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy. That has landed the Postal Service in the middle of a political firestorm, as cost-cutting and other operational changes — such as reduced overtime for mail carriers — have caused widespread delays in the mail system and raised concerns about mail-in ballots ahead of the November presidential election. Worries about mail-in voting have been fueled by Mr. Trump, who derided the agency as a “joke” and has repeatedly raised questions about the legitimacy of mail-in voting and has encouraged voters to go to the polls instead of voting by mail. “The honorable thing to do is drop the Mail-In Scam before it is too late!,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter earlier this month. Lawmakers from both political parties have raised concerns about the Postal Service’s ability to handle mail-in ballots and have summoned Mr. DeJoy, to testify in hearings before the Senate and House in the coming days. Mr. Williams also told lawmakers on Thursday that he had raised concerns months ago about the possible selection of Mr. DeJoy and had suggested fellow board members investigate the executive’s background. As the board moved to hire Mr. DeJoy, a major donor to Mr. Trump and other Republicans, to lead the multibillion-dollar agency this spring, Mr. Williams resigned in protest, citing his concerns about Mr. DeJoy as one reason. “I had expressed concerns after each of the interviews with Mr. Louis DeJoy,” Mr. Williams told two House Democratic lawmakers in a statement. “I urged that a background investigation be conducted. And when I resigned, I cited it as one of my reasons for submitting my resignation to Chairman Robert Duncan.” The statement was disclosed on Thursday afternoon in a letter from Representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois and Katie Porter of California, both Democrats, to John M. Barger, another Postal Service governor who spearheaded the search for the new postmaster general. Its release came just an hour before Mr. Williams was scheduled to testify. The lawmakers approached Mr. Williams to respond to comments Mr. Barger made to The New York Times on Wednesday. Mr. Barger said that he had “never heard an objection from David Williams about any of the candidates, other than the ones we did not hire” and that he was “surprised” by Mr. Williams’s resignation in late April, shortly before the board unanimously ratified the selection of Mr. DeJoy and announced it publicly. “I don’t recall him ever having objected to anything,” Mr. Barger told The Times, “or I would have asked him why. And it would have been considered.” David A. Partenheimer, a Postal Service spokesman, declined to comment on Mr. Williams’s claims. Treasury’s 2018 postal report offered a broad critique of the Postal Service’s business model and concluded that an antiquated mission along with changing market forces left the agency ripe for financial collapse. The report suggested that postal workers were overpaid relative to other government employees and private sector delivery services and that compensation reductions along with other cost cutting measures were needed. There were also recommendations to cut services, such as scaling back delivery days and making it easier to close post offices and remove mailboxes. The task force said that to be more cost efficient, the Postal Service should exercise “discretion to lower service standards.” Updated August 17, 2020 This week, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, published a letters that were exchanged between Mr. Mnuchin and the Postal Service’s board of governors that indicated that Mr. Mnuchin met with some of the governors on Feb. 6 2020 to discuss the status of the search for a new Postmaster General. In a letter to the board in December 2019, Mr. Mnuchin underscored his interest in the process of  finding a new leader for the Postal Service. “I would appreciate being kept apprised of the progress of your executive search, as appropriate,” Mr. Mnuchin wrote. Mr. DeJoy, a former transportation and logistics executive, began the job in June and has quickly come under intense scrutiny for his continuing financial ties to his previous employer, which does business with the Postal Service, as well as cost-cutting initiatives that have slowed mail delivery. Lawmakers of both parties, along with civil rights groups and state attorneys general, have raised concerns about the operational changes given the growing likelihood that many Americans will need to vote by mail this November because of the coronavirus pandemic. At a time when Mr. Trump is attacking mail-in voting, voting rights advocates fear that the slowdown in service could intentionally or incidentally undermine the integrity of the vote. Mr. DeJoy said on Tuesday that he would suspend some of the changes, but he has not committed to Democrats’ demands that he reverse some that are already in place, like the removal of hundreds of mail-sorting machines. Democrats are now trying to use Congress’s power to force him to do so and infuse $25 billion in emergency funding into the beleaguered agency, which has been rattled by the pandemic. Mr. Williams, one of the Republican-controlled board’s designated Democratic members, had served for 13 years as the Postal Service’s inspector general. A former Army intelligence officer, he had worked in similar watchdog roles at a handful of other agencies before that. Mr. Williams had not spoken publicly since he left the board of governors, but people familiar with his thinking have said he had grown increasingly alarmed about the politicization of the Postal Service and specifically the influence of the Treasury Department. Under Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a department task force has pushed for substantial cost-cutting changes at the Postal Service, which union leaders, Democrats and others contend are really an attempt to sabotage the agency to benefit private competitors. In their letter, Mr. Krishnamoorthi and Ms. Porter asked Mr. Barger, who has also donated to Republicans, to detail “any possible coordination you may have had with political entities when recommending Mr. Louis DeJoy to the selection committee.” The board of governors retained an outside firm, Russell Reynolds Associates, to help facilitate the search. But the lawmakers cite multiple unnamed people involved in the search saying that it was Mr. Barger, not the firm, who had injected Mr. DeJoy’s name into the process. In the interview with The Times, Mr. Barger said that the candidates were vigorously vetted and that Mr. DeJoy’s selection had been unanimous. Mr. DeJoy will testify before a Senate panel for the first time on Friday and before a House panel on Monday. Kenneth P.
