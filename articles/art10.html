To the Editor: Re “Troubling Facts From Physicians Undercut Trump” (front page, Oct. 5): Perhaps no event better demonstrates and exemplifies President Trump’s personality and character than his drive-by outside Walter Reed hospital on Sunday. This was a brazen, wanton act of disregard for the health or even life of others for an action that was completely unnecessary. Traveling in his hermetically sealed presidential vehicle, Mr. Trump callously disregarded the welfare of the Secret Service agents forced to accompany him. To what end? This drive-by had only two goals, both reflecting the president’s narcissism and insecurities. First, he wanted to demonstrate that even with Covid-19 he was not weak, not debilitated, as he views any sign of weakness as anathema. Second, he needs to receive the constant reassurance of a crowd’s adulation and love. The president is seemingly unaware or indifferent to the tremendously mixed messages he is giving out. While his physicians are administering to the president a drug regimen that experts say is appropriate for a severe case of Covid, the president and his attending doctors are blithely engaging in “happy talk” about how well he is faring. The man who has so badly managed the government’s response to the virus is now abysmally mismanaging the messaging for his own treatment. Is it any wonder that so many people distrust what the president says about everything? Ken Derow
