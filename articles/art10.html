And ended with a vision of how to rebuild our lives. By William Bryant Logan Mr. Logan is an arborist and author. I stood on the edge of a tunnel. I could look down it in both directions. It didn’t end, so far as I could tell. It was wide enough for two big trucks to pass abreast. The color was a uniform misty gray. The light never changed. There was never a breeze. There were only two things there. They stood across from my vantage point, near the opposite wall. Both appeared to be packages, though neither had any logo or label. One was a squat cylinder that might have held a half-dozen dinner plates. The other was a tall rectangle about the size of an old-fashioned stereo speaker. They, too, were gray. My bout with Covid-19 brought me this hallucination. For two weeks, as I lay in bed coughing, I saw it at least once a day. I had no doubt at all that the place was real and that I really stood beside it. In my delirium, I came to know the gray hall pretty well. The pandemic had slammed the brakes on our headlong rush into a touted future and had shut down the entertainments that greased its wheels. The tunnel, I conceived, was the thoroughfare along which all the imported goods and services were supposed to travel, but for the whole time I saw it nothing moved or changed. It made a sort of sense to see the tunnel this way — still, dormant, empty of goods — because so much that I needed could not be had. My doctor told me to take my temperature. I could not buy a thermometer. To clean off the toilet seat with disinfectant wipes. No such product available. To use disposable paper towels and tissues. None to be found. To wear a mask. I coughed all over the two I possessed, and there were no more anywhere. My hallucination was a vision, and this is what it told me: If you insist on bringing an endless stream of items into your life from around the world, you will bring with it unwanted guests. Then, your busy, Technicolor life will turn still and gray. When you treat the world and everything and everyone in it as parts of a vast web of goods and services, the living beings who are at its nodes will suffer. Rapid, constant round-the-world exchange doesn’t bring just a single invasive malady. Look at what has happened to North American trees since World War II. First, we accidentally imported the hemlock woolly adelgid, a pest that has ravaged the hemlock, one of our most important conifers. Then came the Asian long-horned beetle, hidden in shipping pallets, which threatens maples and many other hardwood species. Recently, we added the emerald ash borer, another pallet rider, which is all but eliminating ash trees over most of their range. Now, there is the spotted lanternfly, which is deadly to grapes and to many fruit trees. In the wings is yet another possible malefactor: An Asian roundworm may cause a new disease on American beech. Just as earlier we brought Dutch elm disease and the gypsy moth from Europe, now most problems come from Asian trading partners. What is happening to trees once happened to people. When Europeans appeared in the so-called New World beginning in the 15th century, they brought not only their bodies, their cattle, their trade goods, their crops and their weeds but also their diseases. It is estimated that 90 percent of the Indigenous people were killed over the succeeding century by European maladies. Small pox was the worst, but Europeans brought or spread more than 30 epidemic diseases, some from their homelands, some from other colonies: measles, flu, whooping cough, diphtheria, typhus, cholera, Lyme disease, malaria, yellow fever.
