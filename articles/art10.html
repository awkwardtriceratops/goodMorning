By Richard Goldstein Bob Gibson, the St. Louis Cardinals’ Hall of Fame right-hander who became one of baseball’s most dominating pitchers, winning 251 games in 17 seasons with an intimidating fastball and an attitude to match, died on Friday. He was 84. His death was confirmed by Brian Bartow, a spokesman for the Cardinals. Gibson announced in July 2019 that he had pancreatic cancer. Through the summers of the 1960s and early ’70s, Gibson proved a relentless force, and he was at his best in the World Series. Gibson won both the National League’s Most Valuable Player Award and Cy Young Award, as its best pitcher, in 1968, when he won 22 games, struck out 268 batters, pitched 13 shutouts and posted an earned run average of 1.12. The following year, Major League Baseball lowered the pitchers’ mounds to give batters a break, but Gibson won 20 games and struck out 269. He won at least 20 games five times and struck out 3,117 batters, relying on two kinds of fastballs, one breaking upward and other downward, and a slider that he threw at about three-quarter speed. He threw 56 career shutouts and captured a second Cy Young Award in 1970. He was an eight-time All-Star, won a Gold Glove award for fielding nine times and pitched a no-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1971. He was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1981, his first year of eligibility. Michael Levenson contributed reporting. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
