Instead, it is trying to hold on to a Senate seat and lift President Trump’s low poll numbers. By Jeremy W. Peters CHARLOTTE, N.C. — For most of the past decade, North Carolina was a showcase for the Republican Party’s growth — its strength in the suburbs, in rural areas and in races up and down the ballot proving that it could dominate in parts of the country where demographics favored the Democrats. Now it could be a victim of its own excess. After victories in 2010, when Republicans took control of the state legislature for the first time in more than 100 years, and in 2012, when a Republican won the governor’s race, they used their power in the State Capitol to carry out a sweeping conservative agenda that included tax cuts, caps on medical malpractice damages and ending tenure for teachers. But some of their most contentious moves — creating highly gerrymandered congressional districts; restrictions on gay and transgender rights that prompted national boycotts; and curbs on the power of the Democratic governor — backfired with voters and the courts, which struck down many of them. And after defeating the Republican governor in 2016, Democrats won enough seats in the legislature in 2018 to break the supermajority Republicans had for eight years. Now, embattled Republican lawmakers find their fates intertwined with those of President Trump, a deeply polarizing figure who won here in 2016 by three percentage points but has pushed many voters to their limits with his hectoring style and mismanagement of a coronavirus outbreak that is still spreading throughout the state. North Carolina was supposed to be a more promising opportunity for Republicans, which is why they selected Charlotte, its largest city, as the site of the Republican National Convention this year. The presence of tens of thousands of Trump supporters would be a display of confidence for a party that has carried the state in all but one presidential election since 1980, and planned to do so again. But when the pandemic made that kind of mass gathering unsafe, Mr. Trump got into a spat with state and local officials and moved the festivities to Jacksonville, Fla., only to cancel once that plan proved unfeasible. A much more scaled-down gathering is taking place in Charlotte this week as several hundred Republican officials from across the country meet to vote on relatively mundane party matters — their movements tracked by Bluetooth sensors and their faces shielded by masks, a must per the party’s rules. Polls show former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. tied with Mr. Trump here. And the president’s standing is dragging down the incumbent Republican senator, Thom Tillis, who is trailing his Democratic opponent, Cal Cunningham, in most polls. The challenges in North Carolina are an extension of Republicans’ vulnerabilities in other states across the Sun Belt like Georgia and Arizona. As these places grow more racially diverse, the Republican Party has lost support in the fast-growing communities around large cities by supporting an agenda that some people see as hostile to minorities, immigrants and women. “They say most people get more conservative as you age, but I’ve gotten more liberal,” said Cindy Strom, an educational consultant who lives in the Charlotte suburb of Mooresville after moving from Chicago four years ago. In a sense, Ms. Strom is like other recent transplants who are helping to transform the state’s political dynamics by bringing their liberal sensibilities to a traditionally conservative state. As the mother of a child with special needs, she said she has come to see Republicans as the party that doesn’t care about people like her. “You realize not everybody can pull themselves up by their bootstraps,” she said as she stood in the doorway of her house on recent afternoon. “Some people do need a helping hand from the government.” But if the Republican Party and Mr. Trump were more attuned to women and working families, Ms. Strom said she might not be leaning so much in favor of the Democrats. “Had the Republicans run anybody else, I might not have voted for Hillary,” she said, referring to the 2016 election, when Mr. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in North Carolina. “But it’s almost not about politics. I don’t think he has any morality. I don’t think he’s a very good person.” While Ms. Strom’s vote for Mr. Biden is all but certain, she is not as firm about her vote in the Senate race. Republicans see people like her as their path to holding the Senate majority. But voters’ antipathy for Mr. Trump, combined with the exhaustion that many say they feel when it comes to politics, makes it harder for activists like Chris McCoy to break through. Mr. McCoy, the state director of the conservative political outfit Americans for Prosperity, was preparing for an afternoon of door-to-door canvassing for Mr. Tillis in Ms. Strom’s neighborhood recently. Political division has grown so intense, he said, that many voters have shut down.
