Both the Republican establishment and the conservative news media have been split in their responses to his claims. Heavy hitters like Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have thrown their support behind the president. Others have expressed concern, both in private and publicly, or have remained conspicuously silent. A question remains about how federal judges, particularly those appointed by Mr. Trump, will react to his claims as litigation winds through the courts. Inside the White House and the Trump campaign, there is shock at the direction the contest has taken — many in his camp believed that a win was certain.
