You can watch on a PlayStation 4 or PSVR through the Littlstar app. If you have an Alexa device, you can say “Alexa, play the Democratic National Convention.” Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee and former secretary of state. Four years ago, she appeared onscreen to the sound of breaking glass before being nominated herself. This time, she will be speaking on behalf of the man she hopes can beat Mr. Trump where she could not. Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, the nominal home of the convention. He narrowly defeated Scott Walker, the Republican incumbent, for the governorship in 2018, two years after Mr. Trump won the state. Former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona. Almost killed in a mass shooting in 2011, she has since become one of the United States’ most vocal advocates for stricter gun laws, and her husband, Mark Kelly, is the Democratic candidate for Senate in Arizona. Senator Kamala Harris of California, Mr. Biden’s running mate. She is the first woman of color on a major party’s presidential ticket and will be looking to energize Black voters, the Democratic Party’s most loyal constituency. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico. She is the first Latina Democrat to lead any state and was a vice-presidential contender, and like several other governors, she received some national attention for her response to the coronavirus pandemic. Former President Barack Obama. More than anyone else in the Democratic Party, he is seen as a potential uniter of the party’s moderate and progressive factions. He did not weigh in publicly while the primary was competitive, but he has become more active on the campaign trail (or what remains of it) since endorsing Mr. Biden in April. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader. She has been on the front lines of the ongoing legislative fights with the Trump administration over coronavirus relief and funding for the United States Postal Service. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. She and Senator Bernie Sanders, who spoke on Monday, were the two most prominent progressive candidates in the Democratic primary, and she was on Mr. Biden’s vice-presidential shortlist.
