Stream and Analysis<br></h1><p id="artcont">Michelle Obama is the most effective so far at talking about Trump’s infamous photo op on June 1 at a historic church near the White House, for which largely peaceful protesters were cleared out. This speech seems targeted at voters who are plain exhausted by the daily chaos of the Trump presidency. It has the effect of hands being thrown up in disgust while at the same time begging people not to take this election for granted. “Going high is the only thing that works,” Michelle Obama says, saying that using the same tactics as Trump makes you part of the ugliness. Though this speech is clearly written for the medium, it’s full of headline quotes: “That’s not just disappointing. It’s downright infuriating.” “Going high does not mean putting on a smile and saying nice things when confronted by viciousness and cruelty.” This “going high” will be in almost every lead story and cable recap tonight. Invoking kids watching a “lack of empathy” right now relies on folks who believe something is “just not right,” as she put it. “Going high” is also a construct that would really thrive in a live setting. “He is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment,” Michelle Obama says of Trump. “It is what it is,” Michelle Obama says, a clear flick at Trump’s own description of the massive number of deaths caused by the coronavirus. I’m not sure that Michelle Obama has ever said Donald Trump’s name in public before – she steadfastly refused to do during the 2016 campaign and in her appearances since then. “I understand that my message won’t be heard by some people,” she said, before explaining what she means: “I am a Black woman speaking at the Democratic convention.” She is working this format. This kind of speech would not work nearly as well in a live convention setting. It’s too intimate. “If you think that things can’t get worse, they can and they will,” she said, again an attempt to underscore urgency. Evocative image: “Joe knows the anguish of sitting at a table with an empty chair.” She’s also had practice at this intimacy and been rewarded by audiences for it who have packed arenas for her “Becoming” events and listen to her podcast. It’s notable how many speakers tonight have spoken more about Biden’s character than any positions or policies or even really biography. This has been very light on policy, generally. Nick, I thought the same thing when Mrs. Obama said Biden has “plans to make all of that happen.” There has been virtually no reference to what Biden would do as president. There are two themes, Nick – Biden’s character and Trump’s fitness or lack thereof. Only Sanders mentioned policy specifics. And he was fairly light, given his penchant for such things. After making the “it is what it is” case against Trump (and his unwillingness to change/adapt), Michelle Obama suggests Biden is open-minded enough to keep growing and learning. Michelle Obama just referenced not “playing games with candidates who have no chance of winning.” Looking at you, Kanye West…. This is a remarkably powerful speech. “This is not the time to withhold our votes in protest,” she says, as she urges people to vote early and in person. “We’ve got to request our mail-in ballots right now – tonight.” A palpable sense of urgency. She’s really getting into the specifics of how to vote. Smart, given how hard it could end up being this year. Convention officials mentioned that would be a constant note, Lisa. Never before has getting voting information out been as critical to a ground game as in this pandemic-disrupted election. Right, important to remember that early voting isn’t that far away. Starts as soon as next month in some places.  The delivery is really something – almost a controlled whisper at times – projecting urgency in every line. This Michelle Obama speech set a very high bar for others to follow this week. Yes, totally. Some applause on the live streams that are part of the convention program for Mrs. Obama. Some Democratic officials suspected that Mrs. Obama’s speech would be the most-watched moment of the week, save for Biden’s acceptance. It’s still weird to see people clapping to themselves in their living rooms watching this on TV. Is Eva going to host all week? Nick, there are different emcees each night. The controlled whisper was so powerful. “Wow,” Eva Longoria says as she takes back the mic. “You are what we miss in this country.” The other emcees are Tracee Ellis Ross, Kerry Washington and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. “Veep” comes full circle. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
