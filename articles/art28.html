TRANSCRIPT “Approximately 3:30 p.m., the protest activity that we had been working on was starting to break up. People were starting to egress out of the park.

There were two guns recovered at the scene.” “The person taken into custody was the individual that we determined shot the other individual.” “Right, at the scene or some distance from the scene?” “At the scene. Immediately upon the — right after the shooting occurred, the individual was taken into custody.” By Bryan Pietsch and Concepción de León DENVER — One person was fatally shot in Denver on Saturday against the backdrop of opposing rallies between far-right and far-left activists. The circumstances were still unclear Saturday night, but a local television station reported that a security guard it had hired was being detained in connection with the shooting. The shooting happened at 3:37 p.m. local time near the courtyard of the Denver Art Museum as the protests were winding down, officials said. A video on Twitter and a Denver Post photograph captured the chaotic moments leading up to the gunfire. A man wearing a “Black Guns Matter” T-shirt is seen on the video loudly arguing, in explicit language, with several men. One of the men moves out of view of the camera, and seconds later, he is shot. The camera captures him falling to the ground. The man in the T-shirt was not involved in the shooting. The Post photograph shows the victim spraying Mace or a similar substance right before he is shot. Another video shows several police officers rushing to the scene, shouting, “Drop the gun!” A man can be seen getting down on the sidewalk as officers surround him. Both the victim and the gunman were white men, Joe Montoya, chief of the Police Department’s investigations division, said at a news conference on Saturday evening. The victim was taken to a hospital, where he later died, he said. They were not publicly identified by the authorities, but the police said on Twitter that the gunman was a private security guard with no affiliation with antifa, a loosely affiliated movement of activists who share far-left anti-fascism views and which had come out to protest in Denver on Saturday. The police did not announce the filing of any charges on Saturday. A Denver news channel, 9News, reported that a station producer and a contractor had been taken into custody. “A private security guard who was hired by 9News is the suspect detained by DPD,” the station reported. “It has been the practice of 9News for a number of months to hire private security to protect staff at protests.” The security guard was contracted through Pinkerton, Mark A. Cornetta, president and general manager of 9News, said on Saturday night. He said the producer had been released. A representative for Pinkerton could not be immediately reached late on Saturday night. Chief Montoya said a canister of Mace and two guns had been recovered at the scene. Tensions were high all afternoon. The Denver police, and personnel from the sheriff’s offices of Arapahoe and Douglas Counties, were present at the protests before the shooting.
