Your guide to life after the election. By Thomas B. Edsall Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality. Right now it’s hard to cast our minds past Election Day, or tomorrow for that matter, but a crucial question hangs over the 2020 election. What happens to the political parties they lead if Trump wins and Biden loses? What about the other way around? How would either of these outcomes affect the struggle between the establishment and insurgent wings in each party? At the moment, on the Republican side, the insurgent Trump wing is in control, unchallenged, as the party establishment lies in tatters. On the Democratic side, establishment forces nominated Joe Biden decisively after fending off challenges from the party’s left wing. Two things are clear. First, a Biden defeat would sharply increase the likelihood that the Democratic left — the Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren-Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wing — would wrest control of the nomination process in 2024. Second, the Trump doctrine — xenophobia, animosity to immigration, racial resentment and hatred of all things liberal — is almost certain to continue as the most powerful force in the Republican Party. “It is unlikely that the Republican establishment wing can be reborn,” Howard Rosenthal, a political scientist at N.Y.U., said by email. The Lincoln Project, a concerted campaign against Trump led by prominent Republican strategists and consultants, “doesn’t seem to be moving the needle,” Rosenthal added. Along similar lines, Stanley Feldman, a political scientist at Stony Brook University, argued in an email: There just isn’t much evidence that the previous establishment side of the party (the Bush wing) has significant support among current Republican identifiers. Trump won the Republican nomination in 2016 because he sent the strongest signals to Republican primary voters that he would champion their views as president. At the same time, Feldman continued, “a Biden loss would almost certainly empower the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.” Not only that, Feldman said, Biden desperately needs a Democratic Senate to accomplish most of his priorities. An ineffectual Biden presidency would also strengthen the progressive elements in the party. “While Biden clearly represents the more moderate side of the party,” Feldman added, “it’s important to remember that he is running on a platform that may be more liberal than any Democrat since Lyndon Johnson.” “The Democratic Party will continue to move left,” Feldman contended: Younger Democrats were the basis of Sanders’s support in 2016 and 2020. They are a major source of support for more progressive candidates. Over time, they’ll become a larger fraction of the party. Sean McElwee, one of the founders of the liberal research institute Data for Progress, made the case that the progressive wing will continue to gain strength under a Biden presidency, despite Biden’s moderate instincts. Biden has already agreed, McElwee wrote by email, “to move his platform to the left on key issues.” In addition, Progressives increasingly control much of the party infrastructure. It’s hard to find staffers who aren’t progressives. Wonks? They’re all super liberal! Furthermore, McElwee argued, Young people who dedicate their careers to helping Democrats win elections are much more liberal than the country as a whole, as are the donors who give millions to the campaigns. The increasing reliance on small dollar ideological donors also keeps progressives in the mix. Progressives are empowered as well by the credible threat of challenging moderate party leaders in primaries, McElwee noted, pointing out, as an example, that “Chuck Schumer would prefer to not have a competitive primary, and his way to avoid that is by appealing to the very liberal New York Democratic electorate.” Rogers Smith, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, pointed to the damage a Trump win would inflict on the Democratic mainstream: “A Trump victory, particularly after this terribly conducted Trump campaign, would definitely discredit the Democratic establishment.” Smith noted by email that Democratic primary voters have shown that the strength of the left wing of their party is growing. Its main barrier to success has been perceptions of its relative weakness in general elections. A Trump victory destroys that argument. A Trump defeat, Smith added, will not mean the end of Trumpism: Trump has built a new right populist coalition that has more electoral appeal than the full-tilt neoliberal, moderately multicultural economic and social positions of the prior Republican establishment. It has plenty of reasonably charismatic youthful champions. Its leaders will avoid the crude bullying and rule-flouting that Trump displayed in the recent presidential debate, and they’ll certainly try to avoid Access Hollywood-type scandals. But otherwise they will carry the Trump right-populist movement forward. If Biden is elected, the party’s left wing is likely to push him farther than he wants to go — to adopt more progressive policies on taxation, policing, affirmative action, immigration and other issues that have divided the nation in recent years. This will do little to heal the internal conflicts of the Democratic Party, in the view of D. Sunshine Hillygus, a professor of political science at Duke. She emailed me to say: I think a Democratic win will inevitably aggravate the divide within the current Democratic coalition — it’s easier to unite against something than for something. Hillygus is one of the few experts who argue that the Republican Party will move away from Trumpism, albeit slowly: I tend to think that many Republicans will be looking to expand on Trump’s coalition of religious conservatives and so-called ‘populists’ with a ‘kinder and gentler’ message that is less off-putting to college-educated, suburban Republicans (i.e., Nikki Haley rather than Tom Cotton). While Trump voters might not entirely fade away, I do think that the Republican poster-child will subtly shift. Theda Skocpol, a professor at Harvard of government and sociology, has a substantially different view, contending that if Democrats take both the White House and the Senate, and retain control of the House, they stand a good chance of achieving legislative and political success. If the Democrats fail to win the Senate, however, the party faces problems. Since Trump won four years ago, Skocpol wrote in an email, the Democrats have remained a coherent party able to work together against Trump and the Trumpified G.O.P. If they win enough to govern, that will hold. If not, then conflicts amid stasis will grow. Without control of the Senate, Skocpol continued, the new fusion of free marketism, authoritarian non-majority political urges and ethnonationalism in the G.O.P. will not die out. I expect a Tea Party like reaction and more McConnell efforts to keep Biden from governing effectively. With a Democratic Senate majority, especially with a cushion of 2 or 3 votes, Skocpol wrote that she does not foresee any acute internal conflicts, because there will be so much to do in a pandemic and economic crisis,” adding, “I think joint approaches will not be hard to work out: voting reforms, expansion of Obamacare with a strong public option, college costs help for lower income and lower middle class, robust green jobs investments, etc., etc. Marc Hetherington, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, wrote to say that Democratic control of the Senate will be crucial to the continued strength of the party’s establishment wing. “I suspect winning the Senate will be critical to establishment’s future credibility,” Hetherington emailed. In the short run, “just ridding the White House of Donald Trump will feel like a real accomplishment.” But, he continued: A Democratic administration that continues to flounder in delivering on progressive policy is likely to empower the Warren-Sanders wing of the party. Their knock on Obama was that he failed to accomplish enough. Four more years of that will be a problem. Hetherington and some of his colleagues have begun exploring the possibility that Trump “may well have added something new to the Republican Party, something that is not at all conservative, that wasn’t there before.” This is a preference for people who are “tough, aggressive, willful. Those do not tend to be the characteristics of conservative thinking (nor of liberal thinking).” But, Hetherington added, People who score high in these characteristics prefer children who are tough, aggressive, and forceful rather than kids who are kind and compromising and such. They appear to be Trump’s most resolute supporters. But here is the kicker. The interesting part is that these specific child rearing preferences (toughness, aggressiveness, etc.) are completely uncorrelated with other dimensions of conservatism, such as preferring traditions and traditional authority. Since Hetherington and his co-researchers have never measured this before, we don’t know whether these people used to be Republicans or Democrats or whether they were just on the outside of politics. But we know that they are Trump supporters now, and they are the people who actually favor things like the child separation policy at the southern border. These voters, according to Hetherington, are a force in Republican politics through Donald Trump. I don’t think they are going to go away even if Trump loses. They are going to be a nightmare for Republican politicians for years to come. Even with full control of the White House and Congress, Democrats will face an uphill struggle maintaining popular support, Yphtach Lelkes, a professor of communication and political science at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote me: The one truism of public opinion is that it acts thermostatically. When the government becomes more left-wing, public opinion shifts to the right (and vice versa). This is true both in aggregate, and within parties as well. Based on this logic, Lelkes continued, “if Biden wins, the public will shift to the right. This also means that the median Democrat will also be more right than if Trump wins.” The shift would not, however, threaten the intraparty dominance of the Democratic establishment. “The hard core left,” Lelkes wrote, “will be in a weaker position.” In the alternative setting — Trump wins and continues to push a right-wing agenda — “the public will continue on their leftward shift (which we’ve clearly seen on social issues, ACA attitudes, etc.),” Lelkes wrote. In that case, the Democratic establishment — the moderate left — “will then be in a weaker position.” There are multiple variations on the theme that a Trump victory would severely damage the Democratic center. Sean Westwood, a political scientist at Dartmouth, argued “the gut instinct of the Sanders-Warren constituency in the case of a Trump victory would be to try to move the party leftward,” but the implications would require far more serious remedies, Westwood wrote: If the Democrats cannot win an election against a hated president, with a hugely mobilized base and when they have a large faction of Republican elites supporting their ticket, they should have profound worries about the future of the party. “If a loss occurs,” Westwood continued, blaming the system and moving to the left would still be ill advised — Democrats need to figure out how to win in states that have traditionally gone Republican. For the Democrats, more extremism would likely lead to more losses in the future. To support his argument against the party moving left, Westwood cited a 2015 article, “What Happens When Extremists Win Primaries?” by Andrew Hall, a Stanford political scientist, who found that when a party nominates an extremist candidate, the party’s general-election vote share decreases on average by approximately 9—13 percentage points, and the probability that the party wins the seat decreases by 35—54 percentage points. On a different tack, Brandice Canes-Wrone, a professor of public and international affairs at Princeton, shares the view that the Trump insurgency will remain a powerful force within the party — win or lose. “Even with a decisive loss, the insurgent wing isn’t fading away,” she said: If Trump is alive and well, it’s hard to imagine him maintaining a low profile, and, even without Trump, there are likely G.O.P. presidential candidates popular with this wing of the party. The challenge facing the Republican establishment, if it seeks to regain strength, according to Canes-Wrone, “will be to address the policy and emotional concerns of the insurgent wing without devolving into populism. Whether that will be achieved remains uncertain.” Daniel Schlozman, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins, agreed that the Trump wing of the party will not disappear if Trump is defeated: Whatever happens to Donald Trump himself, or to his family, Trumpism — that is, the American manifestation of global right-populism — is not going away, nor is what Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson call plutocratic populism, namely the fusion of resentment and classic conservatism. Schlozman warned that if Trumpism succeeds in finding new recruits among members of historically Democratic blocs, e.g. anti-immigrant Blacks, it may succeed. The only way to imagine a more responsible Republican Party is for it to lose badly and repeatedly. Given the realities of evenly matched parties and Republican advantages in the Senate and the courts, that is not a likely prospect. Schlozman, in fact, has his doubts about the long-term viability of the Democratic Party. In “The Politics of Listlessness: Polarization, Neoliberalism, and the Democratic Party Since 1980,” written with Sam Rosenfeld, a political scientist at Colgate, Schlozman describes a contemporary Democratic Party that is still suffering from decades of policymaking lethargy that extended from the 1970s into the present. During this period, Schlozman and Rosenfeld wrote, Democrats preached macroeconomic orthodoxy, deregulation in the name of consumer choice, public-private partnerships, and fiscal restraint. Questions about the political control of the economy retreated to the background in debates over what it meant to be a Democrat. The result? Democrats have displayed the politics of listlessness. In various factions from left to center and across institutional loci, this listlessness emerged and endured in ways that defy glib patterns either of party revitalization not yet complete, or else of ongoing decline and fall. According to Schlozman and Rosenfeld, the dominant theme has been a retreat by the Democratic Party and liberalism as a political program from the redistributive and labor-oriented politics of the New Deal order to, in historian Lily Geismer’s words, the “individualist, meritocratic, suburban-centered priorities of liberal, knowledge-oriented professionals.” In a sharply worded critique, Schlozman and Rosenfeld write: “Perhaps no one more purely embodied the post-New Deal Democratic Party in all its vicissitudes than Joe Biden.” This is apparent, they argue, In the shambolic means by which he won the nomination, in his notable mix of commitment and visionlessness, and in the sense of permeability that his campaign all but touted to actors with clearer goals for power, Biden offered a supremely fitting stand-in for his party. David Hopkins, a political scientist at Boston College who maintains the political blog Honest Graft, argued that the forces behind Trump’s ascendancy are now firmly ensconced in the Republican infrastructure and information network. Because of this, a revival of the party’s pre-2016 establishment is unlikely. As Hopkins wrote by email: Trump’s rise is primarily a testament to the growing power of conservative media sources and personalities within the Republican Party at the expense of Republican elected leaders and traditional interest groups. Even a decisive defeat in November doesn’t necessarily reverse that trend — and with Republicans potentially out of power in Washington, the influence of the conservative media over regular Republican voters might well continue to increase. In the event of a Trump loss, the conservative media, Hopkins continued, will undoubtedly portray Trump as a kind of martyr figure whose defeat was caused by the illegitimate machinations of the mainstream media, Lincoln Project RINOs, and Democrats committing voter fraud. That would make it much harder for any Republican leaders who would prefer to move beyond Trumpist populism in the coming years, and would pressure Republican politicians to wage an even more energetic offensive against the conservative movement’s perceived enemies in the government, mainstream media, and educational system. Kay L. Schlozman, also a political scientist at Boston College, has a different analysis of the emergence of a Trump wing of the Republican Party: that Trump created the movement rather than the movement creating him. In a party that is “more or less uniformly white and Christian and an increasingly masculine party,” Schlozman wrote by email, Trump was less the candidate of an insurgent wing than a charismatic candidate who produced the insurgent wing in the course of a hostile takeover of the Republican Party in 2016. Put another way: The populist conservatives who responded enthusiastically to his candidacy, disproportionately white men of limited education, were not a crystallized constituency is search of a champion so much as a nascent constituency supporting a candidate who paid attention to them, did not talk down to them, and incubated their nativist and racial fears. Because of that, Schlozman wrote: Whether Trump wins or loses, the conservative populists and the concerns and dark rhetoric that they bring to Republican politics will not vanish. Not only will the more extreme wing of the Republican survive for the foreseeable future, but in all likelihood both parties will continue to move away from the center, in opposite directions. Frank Baumgartner, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, wrote me: With the increased polarization and party-centered voting, what we’ve found is that the extreme (insurgent) wings in both parties have been enabled; if people won’t cross over party lines to vote, then whoever wins the primary wins the general. So the mass-level polarization is beginning to generate a party-level movement favoring the extremes. In other words, the system is geared to push the two parties in opposite ideological directions, diminishing the ability of centrists to argue for more reasoned general election strategies. These circumstances present no problem for Trump, should he win re-election; in fact, they reinforce the thrust of his governing style. Polarizing forces will, however, pose substantial difficulties for Biden if he wins, increasing the pressure on him to move left, even if such movement threatens Democratic prospects in 2022 and 2024.
