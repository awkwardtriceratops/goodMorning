By Remy Tumin and Hiroko Masuike (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump used a visit to Kenosha, Wis., to highlight his law-and-order message, focusing on unrest, and not racism or police violence. Above, supporters of Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump toured buildings that were damaged in street violence that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake, an unarmed Black man, and then met with law enforcement officials to advocate cracking down on demonstrations that get out of control. But he did not meet with Mr. Blake’s family and described police violence as just the work of “bad apples.” Hundreds of protesters gathered at the corner where Mr. Blake was shot. On Monday night, Mr. Trump compared instances of the police shooting people to golfers who “choke” when trying to sink “a three-foot putt.” He also declined to denounce a 17-year-old who was charged with killing two protesters during a night of unrest in the city last week. 2. The Russian group that meddled in the 2016 election is now using fake accounts and a website set up to look like a left-wing news site, Facebook said. The company said it had been warned by the F.B.I. that a so-called troll farm in St. Petersburg had set up the network. While the disinformation campaign, run by a group known as the Internet Research Agency, did not reach as big of an audience as it did in 2016, this time, there was a new wrinkle: The Russians hired real Americans to write for the website. It is the first public evidence that the agency is attempting to repeat its efforts from four years ago and push voters away from the Democratic presidential candidate. Separately, Twitter will add more context to topics that trend on its service in an effort to clean up a feature that has been used for disinformation. 3. The 2020 presidential race will be decided by voters in a dozen battleground states. Our interactive tool lets you plot the ways each candidate can win, or lose, the race. The bottom line in all possible scenarios: President Trump will need to win some of the states that are currently leaning toward Joe Biden. Try creating your own coalition of states. Mr. Biden is expected to surpass $300 million raised in August, a record-breaking haul fueled by the convention and his selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate. And it’s Primary Day in Massachusetts, where Senator Edward Markey is trying to fend off a challenge from Representative Joseph Kennedy. Here’s what we’re watching for, from the Senate battle on down the ballot. 4. As children around the world return to classrooms, New York City, home to the largest school district in the U.S., is pumping the brakes. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the start of the school year would be delayed by 10 days as part of a deal to avert a teachers’ strike and calm principals and parents anxious about the start of in-person classes. The system’s 1.1 million children will not have any in-person classes until Sept. 21. Parents are wrestling with difficult choices over sending their children to school. Here’s how one science reporter made the decision. 5. The U.S. faces a wave of small-business failures this fall if the government does not step in with a new round of financial assistance. Many small businesses have survived thanks in part to billions of dollars in federal aid (and some weather-dependent adaptations). Now with cooler temperatures approaching, and the threat of a second round of shutdowns, many businesses are facing a stark choice: Do they try to hold on or cut their losses? The Cheers bar in Boston closed over the weekend. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Congress that the economy was recovering from the pandemic-induced recession but “there is more work to be done” and said that he was continuing to push for a “bipartisan agreement” on another round of economic stimulus. Senate Republicans are pushing a scaled-down stimulus plan that could come to a vote next week. 6. Florida is severing ties with Quest Diagnostics, a major laboratory, over delays in providing nearly 75,000 coronavirus test results that date to April. One expert said the differences “could have materially affected the spread of the infection in Florida.” But state health officials said the delay did not drastically distort the extent of the pandemic in the state. In a statement Quest said that the delay was the result of a “technical issue” and that it had been resolved. Above, a testing center in Orlando. Covid-19 has opened our eyes to the danger of disease. But has it opened them enough to look past this outbreak? Our video journalist looked at this question in a 14-mimute Times documentary, “How to Stop the Next Pandemic.” 7. Solace and relief are in high demand — and the advertising industry is responding. Companies have increased spending on commercials for meditation apps, untested tinctures and stress-busting gummies as the pandemic’s death toll rises, along with economic strain. The cannabis industry in particular has been promoting products with the potential to soothe. Are you feeling socially awkward these days? It’s not just you. Deprive people of interactions with peers, and their social skills will atrophy, writes the journalist Kate Murphy in Opinion, another side effect of the pandemic. Above, an awkward moment in New York City last month. 8. Serena Williams is on her quest for a 24th Grand Slam title tonight. She’s playing Kristie Ahn in the first round of the U.S. Open. Williams and Ahn, both Americans, didn’t have that far to travel to Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York. But others didn’t have the same good fortune: Some traveled thousands of miles and quarantined, only to face the buzz saw of No. 1 seeds. Andy Murray pulled out a win following a nearly five-hour match with Yoshihito Nishioka of Japan. Daniil Medvedev plays Federico Delbonis tonight, Karolina Muchova takes on Venus Williams and Kim Clijsters returns from her second retirement to play Ekaterina Alexandrova. Here’s what to watch for. 9. Conservationists in Argentina are trying to reintroduce jaguars to the wild after more than seven decades of absence. Bringing back the top predator to the country’s wetlands, a process known as rewilding, could restore the health of an entire ecosystem. But coaxing five felines with troubled pasts to hunt, and mate, is not easy. Our reporter visited Iberá National Park, where teams of experts are working untold hours to make that happen — from a distance. One more from the animal kingdom: It took three days to free a juvenile humpback whale from 4,000 pounds of fishing gear in New York Harbor in late July. As more whales venture to cleaner waters off New York City, many are injured or killed by entanglements, strandings and ship strikes. 10. And finally, getting your deep-fried Oreo fix. State fairs around the country may be canceled because of the coronavirus, but food vendors and their devoted fans are going to great lengths to keep the corn dogs and chicken-on-a-stick, above, flowing. One vendor is accepting direct messages for dishes she can fry, freeze and ship. A food stand owner created a website for pickup orders of pickle dogs, turkey legs and deep-fried Oreos. A business is shipping boxes of Minnesota State Fair food anywhere within the continental U.S. When the Oregon Dairy Women took their state-fair soft-serve on the road, the word that customers kept bringing up was “normal,” the group’s president said. “Oh, finally something that feels normal about the summer.” Have a scrumptious evening.
