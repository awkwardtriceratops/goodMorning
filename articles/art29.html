By Kevin Carey Twenty-four years ago, California was consumed by debate over affirmative action. A charismatic Black businessman named Ward Connerly led support for Proposition 209, a ballot initiative to ban racial preferences in admission to the state’s world-renowned public universities. The measure passed with 55 percent of the vote and inspired similar changes in nearly a dozen other states. This November, with an initiative to repeal Proposition 209 on the ballot, California voters will have the opportunity to change their minds. And a comprehensive study released Friday finds that by nearly every measure, the ban has harmed Black and Hispanic students, decreasing their number in the University of California system while reducing their odds of finishing college, going to graduate school and earning a high salary. At the same time, the policy didn’t appear to greatly benefit the white and Asian-American students who took their place. Affirmative action, Mr. Connerly has said, is outdated, unfair and bad for everyone — including students of color. Of Black students, he said: “Do you know what reinforces the idea that they’re inferior? Being told they need a preference to succeed.” Opponents of affirmative action have aggressively challenged race-based preferences in the Supreme Court, and are expected to do so again. This month, President Trump’s Department of Justice accused Yale of illegal admissions discrimination against white and Asian-American students. In California, the effect of Proposition 209 on the state’s elite universities was immediate. Black and Hispanic enrollment at the flagship Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses fell steeply. Legal challenges to the policy were beaten back. A generation of students has since come and gone. Now a Berkeley economist, Zachary Bleemer, has conducted the first comprehensive study of what actually happened to those students. He assembled an anonymized database of every student who applied to eight campuses in the University of California system from 1994 to 2002, including their high school grades, demographics, income and SAT scores. He tracked where they went to college, whether in California or elsewhere, along with their academic majors and degrees. For those in California, he also tracked what courses they took and how much they earned in the job market for years after graduation. The study found that Black and Hispanic enrollment declined across the University of California system after Proposition 209 fully took effect in 1998. Students who would have enrolled at the flagship campuses before the ban attended less selective universities in the system. This in turn pushed out other Black and Hispanic students, who moved down the ladder of selectivity. Those at the bottom lost their grip entirely, exiting the system altogether. Some opponents of affirmative action have argued such an outcome would actually benefit students of color who, they assert, have been hurt by preferential admissions, being unable to compete with academically superior classmates — the so-called mismatch hypothesis. Jack Mountjoy, a University of Chicago economist, says “the existing literature on affirmative action and mismatch is a scattershot of arguments and empirical results with little substantive consensus.” Mr. Mountjoy’s own research has found small negative effects — a one-percentage-point decrease in graduation rates and a $1,000 decline in earnings — for Black students attending more selective public universities in Texas, a state that promotes racial diversity by guaranteeing students who graduate in the top 10 percent of their high school class admission to a state-funded college. But the effects exist only because Black students are unusually successful by comparison at a pair of less selective historically Black institutions. Mr. Bleemer’s study does not support the mismatch hypothesis. If Black and Hispanic students had benefited from enrolling in less selective universities, they would have been more successful in rigorous math and science courses there. They were not. Instead, they were less likely to earn bachelor’s degrees in a science or engineering field, as well as less likely to graduate over all, compared with Black and Hispanic students before Proposition 209. They were also less likely to earn graduate degrees. Any differences in their classroom success compared with white and Asian-American students appeared to be largely explained by lower-quality preparation in K-12 schools, the study said, not admissions preferences. Black and Hispanic students with lower high school grades were affected most. Mr. Mountjoy calls the study “an important and impressive piece of scholarship” that “brings some clarity to this chaotic literature.” Proposition 209 also depressed the number of highly qualified Black and Hispanic high school students who applied to the University of California system, perhaps because they mistakenly believed they would not be accepted. The timing could not have been worse. California in the late 1990s was on the cusp of an explosion in technology-created wealth. Degrees from the state’s elite universities were a ticket to the riches of Silicon Valley. Because of Proposition 209, students of color in the study earned 5 percent less on average every year, an effect that persisted into their mid-30s, when the study period ended. The impact on wages was concentrated among Hispanic students, who were also significantly less likely to earn more than $100,000 per year. Of course, selective university admissions is a zero-sum game. For every Black and Hispanic student excluded by Proposition 209, another student, probably white or Asian-American, took their place. But in focusing on those who got into the most selective U.C. campus at Berkeley, the study found that white and Asian-American students received little concrete benefit from the policy. Mr. Bleemer’s study suggests they would have otherwise enrolled in an equally selective college elsewhere, and had the same chances to graduate and begin successful careers. Another recent study of the Texas top 10 percent admissions preference found similar results: The more racially and economically diverse students who benefited by enrolling at selective University of Texas campuses were more likely to graduate and earn higher salaries, while the students who were displaced did not suffer by the same measures. In other words, the measure in California seems to have set back a generation of Black and Hispanic students, pushing them down and out of the University of California system and helping to widen the racial wealth gap, with seemingly little offsetting benefits for other students. Mr. Bleemer’s research is the first of its kind on this issue. Other studies of Proposition 209 and the mismatch hypothesis, however well designed, have relied on inference and smaller samples of people. This study includes detailed, multidecade information about every person who applied to the University of California in the years directly before and after the change. In his dissent in Fisher v. Texas II, the 2016 Supreme Court decision that upheld racial preferences at the University of Texas, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote, “Every time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all.” Deeply held convictions about race and opportunity may not be easily swayed by social science research. The battle over affirmative action is likely to continue in statehouses, the courts and the public square. But for supporters of affirmative action who have largely been playing defense on the issue since Proposition 209 set off a cascade of controversy in the 1990s, the new research suggests that college admissions preferences could be a valuable tool for improving racial opportunity gaps that have continued to widen over time. Meanwhile, Mr. Connerly, now 81, has moved back to Sacramento to fight the November ballot initiative and preserve his legacy. Kevin Carey directs the education policy program at New America.
