RIGHT NOW At least two people have died in the fires: a helicopter pilot on a water-dropping mission and an electrical utility worker assisting the fire response. Wildfires continued to rip across Northern California on Thursday, as the state struggled to contain the blazes and to help thousands of people who are fleeing their homes amid a grueling heat wave, the coronavirus pandemic and unsafe air thick with smoke. A large group of fires burning in wine country west of Sacramento had grown to cover 131,000 acres by Thursday, according to Cal Fire, the state’s fire authority. The agency said that, in all, nearly 350,000 acres have burned in Northern and Central California, with many fires sparked by lightning strikes in the high heat and then fanned by winds. Those conditions helped new fires sprout across the state Wednesday and Thursday, and caused other fires to merge, complicating efforts to contain the combined blazes. Almost two dozen major fires were reported Wednesday, and more than 300 smaller ones. Evacuation orders have affected thousands of people in Northern California. The group of wildfires threatening Vacaville, called the L.N.U. Lightning Complex, has already destroyed more than 105 homes and other buildings. Cal Fire said 30,500 more buildings are under threat. At least two people have died in the firefighting effort. One was a helicopter pilot on a water-dropping mission who was killed in a crash in Fresno County on Wednesday. Another was a worker for Pacific Gas & Electric who had been clearing the area of electrical lines for firefighters and was found unresponsive in his vehicle in Solano County on Wednesday. California was under intense strain from the heat wave even before the explosion of new fires, with rolling blackouts shutting off power to many residents. The temperature Thursday was expected to again surpass 90 degrees Fahrenheit in Sacramento, Napa and Sonoma Counties. East of Silicon Valley, the S.C.U. Lightning Complex group of fires prompted evacuation orders on the edge of San Jose. That combination of about 20 fires grew to 137,475 acres overnight, but has largely been kept away from more populated areas. Brice Bennett, a spokesman for CalFire, said firefighters had started to see cooler temperatures and calmer winds at night, allowing them to begin to try to contain the blazes. Firefighters often make more progress at night, but recently, the winds and high temperatures had kept up even after sunset. Mr. Bennett doesn’t expect the reprieve to last, though, so firefighters are trying to do as much as they can at night. “We don’t have the winds that we did three days ago, and that’s a huge impact,” he said. “Mother nature’s in charge, so we’re just doing what we can with the window that we’re given.” [Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.] Even far from the fires, the air smells like smoke and ash flakes can be seen on cars and in backyards. The air quality around the Bay Area improved slightly on Thursday, but is still dangerously unhealthy in some areas, particularly around Vacaville, which is near Sacramento, and in Concord. The air quality index, which measures air pollution, has surpassed 150 in some areas, meaning the air is unhealthy for people even if they have no health risks, and especially dangerous for people who are sensitive to unclean air.  The index goes up to 500, but anything above 100 is considered unhealthy. People should avoid going outside at all, especially to exercise, while the air quality is in the unhealthy range, said Dr. Afif El-Hasan, a lung health specialist in Orange County. He said the smoke could also make people more vulnerable to the coronavirus, if they were infected. “Anything that weakens the lungs, like really bad air, which causes the lungs to lose some of their ability to fight infection, is going to be an issue,” Dr. El-Hasan said. “In theory, breathing in a lot of bad air can make you more susceptible to a more serious Covid illness.” Roger Gass, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Bay Area office, said winds are pushing smoke from the wildfires toward larger population areas, where it is then sitting still. Often, winds will push smoke inland or out to sea, but the wind is instead blowing the smoke slowly south. “We’re basically stuck in a stagnant pattern,” he said, adding that he did not expect any significant change in the coming days if the fires continue to rage. “They’re just pumping more smoke into the air,” Mr. Gass said of the blazes. “It looks like it’s going to be here to stay for a little while.” California’s oldest state park, Big Basin Redwoods State Park, has sustained extensive damage from the group of fires known as the C.Z.U. August Lighting Complex in Santa Cruz County, according to the California Parks and Recreations Department. The park is known for its 80 miles of walking trails among the majestic redwoods that are between 1,000 and 2,000 years old. The fire damaged the park’s headquarters, a one-story building constructed from redwood logs and stone that was built in 1936 and is included in the National Register of Historic Places. Also damaged was the park’s “historic core and campgrounds,” the department said. The group of fires has grown to cover more than 40,000 acres, fire officials said on Thursday morning, and has destroyed 20 buildings. The Santa Cruz Sheriff’s Office said nearly 28,000 people had been ordered to evacuate their homes. More than two dozen parks were partially or fully closed as the wildfires burned across the state, according to the department. Sara Barth, executive director of the Sempervirens Fund, an organization dedicated to the protection of redwoods, said park officials told her that conditions at Big Basin remain too dangerous for anyone to assess damage to the trees. During the pandemic, people have gone to see the enormous redwoods in an effort to find solace and perspective, Ms. Barth said. The fire “would be a tragedy at any point,” she said. “But it feels especially cruel and apocalyptic at a time of so many other crises.” Still, Ms. Barth said there is reason to be optimistic about the fate of the trees. “They’re meant to resist and even thrive in response to wildfires,” she said. “If any place is going to be able to withstand this conflagration it’s Big Basin.” In Sonoma County, the authorities issued an evacuation warning late Wednesday to the city of Healdsburg, which is home to 12,000 people. “Please remain calm,” the city government said in a statement. “Our goal is to increase your state of readiness, not to frighten you.” Residents in the city prepared to flee as officials ordered evacuations in parts of several other counties, including San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Alameda, Stanislaus and Santa Rosa. Travis Air Force Base in Solano County mandated the evacuation of all “non-mission essential personnel” as the L.N.U. Lightning Complex fires approached on Wednesday night. Shaun McCaffery, an engineer and vice-mayor of Healdsburg, said he packed his family’s 22-foot trailer with frozen pizzas, chicken nuggets, water, clothes and books in case he, his wife and his two stepchildren have to get out. He planned to head to Oregon, where the family vacationed in their trailer earlier this year. Mr. McCaffery said he bought the trailer in May at the suggestion of his wife, who thought the family needed a “fire escape vehicle” after wildfires last year. “I know some friends of ours immediately left town,” Mr. McCaffery said. “The city is not in imminent danger but they’re worried about the behavior of the fire due to the winds.” The city, which is nestled among the county’s wineries and is dotted with farm-to-table restaurants, came under evacuation orders last October during the Kincade Fire, which burned through more than 76,000 acres in Sonoma County. Mr. McCaffery said his stepchildren, a 12-year-old girl and 14-year-old boy, have remained calm throughout the most recent ordeal. “They’re amazing. They’re very resilient,” he said. He added: “I’m really proud of them for persevering in the kind of crazy world that we live in these days.” Have you evacuated because of the fires? If you are in a safe place and able to do so, we’d like to hear about whether you have been forced to leave or if you have left your home in anticipation of an evacuation order.

The fire crews, along with other California prisoners, have been hard-hit by the coronavirus, which is sweeping through the state’s correctional facilities. In California state prisons, more than 12,000 inmates and guards have been infected, and at least 64 people have died, according to the state corrections department. This summer, only 90 of the state prison’s 192 inmate fire teams are available to help clear brush and perform other important firefighting tasks, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. While a number of inmate firefighters have become infected, other crews are under quarantine orders. Some firefighters have also been released from prison in recent weeks to reduce overcrowding in prisons and fire camps. In all, four of the six prisons that train incarcerated firefighters have had coronavirus outbreaks of more than 200 cases each, including the California Institution for Women in Corona, which trains female firefighters. That prison has had 417 cases. The shortage has forced the state to enlist members of the National Guard and to hire civilian replacements for the inmate crews, officials said. Members of the inmate crews — who can earn up to just over $5 a day, plus $1 an hour when fighting fires — have been stretched thin for several weeks, said Michelle Garcia, program coordinator at an inmate fire training facility center in Ventura County. “We’re neglected and we’re overlooked,” she said. Ms. Garcia said crew members had been drinking out of the same water spigot and that washing hands, social distancing and wearing face masks were afterthoughts. “Once that fire call hits, it’s fire first,” she said. “Fire doesn’t care about COVID.”  In Riverside, Nevada and Contra Costa Counties, dozens of evacuated families are being sent first to emergency hotel lodging rather than to the high school gyms that usually serve as evacuation centers. In the coastal town of Pescadero, south of San Francisco, authorities used the high school as an evacuation center on Wednesday. Normally, cots would be set up for people to spend the night. But no one is allowed inside now, so aid workers have been setting up displaced residents at nearby hotels. Rita Mancera, the executive director of Puente, a social services organization helping evacuees, said people have been bringing their pigs, turkeys, goats, cows and horses to the school parking lot. Masked volunteers were handing out water, food and hand sanitizer. People waiting at the school have to sit outside or in their cars. Dealing with the evacuees during a pandemic was “kind of overwhelming,” Ms. Mancera said. “We’re asking people to be social distanced.” In Pescadero, Lynne Bowman gestured to the trailer where she slept. “This is where I live now,” Ms. Bowman said. She, her husband and her daughter evacuated their house on Tuesday in 45 minutes, bringing clothes, jewelry and their two dogs, Viggo and Hedy. Just a few days earlier, Ms. Bowman was celebrating her daughter’s wedding, a 20-person socially distanced affair. Now, she is contemplating the confluence of catastrophic events in the area. “Yeah, pandemic, fire,” she said. “I mean, it is apocalyptic in many ways.” Reporting was contributed by Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, Kellen Browning, Maria Cramer, Thomas Fuller, Rebecca Griesbach, Lucy Tompkins, Maura Turcotte and Alan Yuhas. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
