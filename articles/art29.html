Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Friday. Weather: Mostly cloudy, gradually turning sunny, with a high around 70. Sunny over the weekend, with highs staying near 70. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Wednesday (Veterans Day). One thing is clear: In 2020, Republicans made gains in New York. Though none of New York’s at least 1.2 million mail-in ballots had been counted as of Thursday night, the G.O.P. appeared to have had an ascendant election. Republican candidates were leading in many competitive races across the state, mirroring a trend seen in swing districts nationwide. [Get the latest results from New York State here.] Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a three-term Democrat, found at least one person to blame: Mayor Bill de Blasio. “They ran de Blasio’s picture all over the state,” Mr. Cuomo said in an interview on WAMC radio, referring to G.O.P. candidates who had courted moderate and liberal voters, and depicted New York City as a place of “looting, and crime and homelessness.” Joseph R. Biden Jr. sailed to victory in New York. The call for Mr. Biden in the presidential race was made shortly after 9 p.m. on Tuesday; as of Thursday night, 84 percent of the estimated vote total was in. Ritchie Torres and Mondaire Jones, both Democrats, will be the first openly gay Black members in Congress. Their victories, both in House races, suggested that Americans were growing more willing to elect gay representatives who need not be white, my colleague Dana Rubinstein wrote. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won a second term in a costly loss for the G.O.P. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has become a national celebrity and is a target of right-wing politicians and media. Her race against John Cummings, a first-time Republican candidate, was the second most expensive contest for the House. Key congressional races across New York were still undecided. On Thursday night, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis in New York City, and Representative Lee Zeldin and Assemblyman Andrew Garbarino on Long Island — all Republicans — seemed poised for House victories. In Central New York, Republican Representatives Claudia Tenney, a former seat holder, and John Katko, an incumbent, were also running ahead of their Democratic opponents. Democrats’ hopes of winning a veto-proof supermajority in the State Senate could be in doubt. Initial vote counts reflected that some Democratic incumbents — notably those on Long Island — could lose. A supermajority would have likely reduced the power of Mr. Cuomo to thwart legislation he disliked. There is also a nail-biter in New Jersey: Our neighbors were awaiting a call in the race between Representative Jeff Van Drew and his Democratic challenger, Amy Kennedy. Mr. Van Drew, who switched parties this year and pledged “undying support” to President Trump, was leading Ms. Kennedy on Thursday night, when the state had reported 76 percent of the estimated vote.

Dear Diary: I was in Harry’s Shoes on the Upper West Side taking in the usual Sunday afternoon chaos while waiting for a saleswoman to bring me a pair to try on. There were children running around and boxes piled on the counter waiting to be rung up. Most of the people walking around the store were casually dressed in jeans and T-shirts, so the well-dressed woman sitting across from me and smiling at everything going on around us stood out. “This is such an exciting place for an East Side person,” she said to me. — Karin Wiseman New York Today is published weekdays around 6 a.m. Sign up here to get it by email.
