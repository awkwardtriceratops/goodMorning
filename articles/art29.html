Some rallies, like those in Portland, Maine, and Memphis, were small but vocal, while protests in Seattle and Portland, Ore., were effectively declared riots after demonstrators set fires and threw explosives at the police. Thousands of protesters marched through the streets of New York, including a group in Brooklyn that met outside the Barclays Center and swelled to around 2,000 people as it marched across the Manhattan Bridge and shut down traffic. In Portland, Ore., a person in a crowd of protesters threw a Molotov cocktail at a line of police officers, sending the officers running for safety as flames erupted on the street. About 100 people joined the Rev. Michael Pfleger in a march on Chicago’s South Side, stopping to shut down traffic in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood for about an hour. In Seattle, about 200 protesters in raincoats and ponchos marched through downtown. The New York Times has photographers on the ground following protests across the country. Protesters poured into the streets in Louisville after the grand jury announcement. The demonstrators called for all three officers, who are white, to be held to account for Ms. Taylor’s death in March. Ms. Taylor’s death, which came months before George Floyd was killed by the Minneapolis police, became a rallying cry for racial justice protesters nationwide. Law enforcement secured the area where a police officer was shot on Wednesday night. At least two police officers were shot shortly before a 9 p.m. curfew.
