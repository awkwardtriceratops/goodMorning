Democrats’ Showing<br></h1><p id="artcont">Supported by New York State Republicans used images of boarded-up businesses and of Mayor Bill de Blasio to persuade voters to vote for their candidates. By Jesse McKinley, Dana Rubinstein and Emma G. Fitzsimmons ALBANY, N.Y. — With Democrats facing the loss of at least one congressional seat in New York and several state senators imperiled on Long Island, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the state’s top Democrat, found a familiar scapegoat: Mayor Bill de Blasio. “They ran de Blasio’s picture all over the state,” the governor said in an interview on Thursday, noting that the city was depicted as a place of “looting, and crime and homelessness.” “That was their message, and it resonated more than it should have,” he said on WAMC radio, adding, “It shouldn’t have been this close.” Mr. Cuomo, like many Democratic leaders in New York, cautioned that many thousands of absentee ballots were still to be counted, and he scolded Republicans for prematurely claiming victory in several closely watched races. But the governor’s comments offered a first glimpse at potential strains among New York Democrats as their senior leaders wrestle with anxiety over the results of Tuesday’s election. Some officials, like Mr. Cuomo, are already at the finger-pointing stage. The mayor has certainly become a reliably powerful tool for Republican candidates looking for moderate suburban and rural votes. This election cycle they invoked Mr. de Blasio to suggest that Democrats were weak on crime and fond of high taxes. As such they echoed national attacks from Republicans on figures like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow Democrat and progressive from the city. “They used Bill de Blasio and A.O.C. as their villains,” said Jay Jacobs, the chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee and a close ally of Mr. Cuomo’s. He added that voters saw images like “major stores on Fifth Avenue being boarded up” the day before Election Day. “It created unease and fed the Republican law-and-order narrative.” The mayor was not the only Republican target; candidates also attacked the governor, as well as Democratic legislative leaders. Mr. de Blasio, when told of the governor’s comments, brushed them off and played down the Republicans’ successes. “I think whatever the Republicans did was pretty modest, honestly,” he said. The Republican Party did seem poised to unseat Representative Max Rose, a first-term Democratic incumbent in the 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and parts of South Brooklyn — a race in which both candidates heavily criticized the mayor. In that race, Mr. Rose called Mr. de Blasio “the worst mayor in the history of New York City” and stridently denied, in the closing days of the campaign, that Mr. de Blasio had endorsed him. (The mayor said that he had not issued a formal endorsement, but that he normally supported Democrats.) Mr. Rose seemed to be in deep trouble against his Republican challenger, Nicole Malliotakis, a state assemblywoman who allied herself closely with the president. In Albany, the Democratic leaders of the State Senate had been dreaming of attaining a veto-proof supermajority, something that would have given them additional leverage in their often tense negotiations with Mr. Cuomo, a fiscal centrist who has rebuffed liberal ideas like higher taxes on the rich and universal health care. But several Democratic incumbents on Long Island seemed to be at risk of losing their seats after machine counts of ballots, including State Senators Monica Martinez and James F. Gaughran, both of whom trailed Republicans by approximately 14,000 votes; another, Senator Kevin M. Thomas, was facing a slightly slimmer deficit, down by 8,000 votes. Statistics from Suffolk County show there is very little wiggle room for Ms. Martinez, who is running against Alexis Weik, a Republican: There were about 23,000 mail-in ballots received in Suffolk as of Wednesday morning, with nearly 11,000 coming from Democrats. In Mr. Gaughran’s district, which includes parts of both Suffolk and Nassau, some 36,000 absentee ballots have been received — again, with about half coming from registered Democrats — though the number in Nassau was unclear. Still, Democratic strategists insisted that absentee ballots — which won’t be counted on Long Island or New York City until next week — could very well be enough to salvage their candidates. “Everybody gets that the longer the votes are counted, the votes that are out there are Democratic,” said Evan Stavisky, a political consultant whose firm is involved in State Senate races. “If we understand that to be true in Pennsylvania, it’s cognitive dissonance that we don’t understand that to be true in New York.” And while Mr. Stavisky recognized that some Democrats could lose, he said it was also possible the party could still retain its current 40 seats or even grow its majority because of wins in upstate races. “The Senate Democrats are likely to be in the same range of where they are now,” he said. All three vulnerable Democrats had been hammered by Republicans on the issue of bail reform and other criminal justice reforms passed in 2019. Those messages were amplified by $4.5 million in indirect spending from Ronald S. Lauder, the billionaire cosmetics heir, who funded a political action committee that ran ads opposing candidates in nearly a dozen State Senate races. Those digital and television ads made no mention of Mr. de Blasio, but focused on bail reform, creating ads featuring loaded guns and wailing sirens. Mr. Cuomo, for one, thought the campaign was effective. “They branded Democrats as anti-law and order,” he said, adding that while he thought it was untrue, “That hurt Democrats.” Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, has been criticized in the past for doing little to help fellow Democrats, particularly Mr. de Blasio. This fall, however, Mr. Cuomo has done a series of virtual fund-raisers and robocalls for candidates, including Ms. Martinez, Mr. Gaughran and Mr. Thomas. For fellow Democrats in the city, the emphasis on the mayor — and the supposed hellscape he presides over — is nothing new. “The Republicans did that two years ago as well, maybe even four years ago,” said State Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat from the east side of Manhattan. “That doesn’t mean it’s de Blasio’s fault. That means the Republicans like to use him as their bogyman.” Ms. Krueger noted that Mr. Cuomo’s policy decisions had become targets of many Republican candidates: Bail reform, after all, was a state law, signed by Mr. Cuomo, not Mr. de Blasio. In one case, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio were used together as campaign fodder in a mailing to upstate New York voters, featuring their grinning faces — alongside the Senate majority leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins — and accusing the three of being “N.Y.C. liberals” devoted to higher taxes. “More money for them,” the flyer read. “Less money for us.” Richard Azzopardi, a senior adviser to the governor, called such ads “wasted money” and dismissed criticism of the governor’s handling of nursing homes during the pandemic as “a sad political attack to deflect from the many Republican failures to manage and contain Covid.” Even Mr. Jacobs suggested that the connection between Mayor de Blasio and the suburban candidates was tenuous at best. “The guys out here have never even met the guy,” Mr. Jacobs, who is also the chairman of the Nassau County Democrats, said of the mayor. “Kevin Thomas who may or may not be losing — he’s never met Bill de Blasio.” For his part, the mayor seemed somewhat sanguine about his role as bad guy in other people’s campaigns, joking on Thursday that he might consider using his reputation to help Democrats in a different way. “I think what I’ll do going forward is just make sure I strongly endorse the Republican candidates,” he said. “And confuse matters.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
