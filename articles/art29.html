Video by Lasse Linder Mr. Linder is a filmmaker. In the Op-Doc above, we enter the world of an older man living by himself in a small city at the Swiss-Austrian border. Only he’s not alone — he has his two Scottish fold cats, Marmelade and Katyusha. The cats accompany him everywhere: to the bar, to the ski slopes, to the grocery store. As we watch their relationship unfold, the three build a world that’s exclusively and intimately theirs — a reminder that families are whatever we make them out to be. What defines them is love.
