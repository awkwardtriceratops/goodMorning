By Michael M. Grynbaum and Maggie Haberman Next week’s presidential debate was on the verge of cancellation after President Trump said on Thursday that he would refuse to participate in a virtual matchup and Joseph R. Biden Jr. pledged to hold a televised town-hall gathering with voters on the same night. Mr. Trump rejected plans by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which cited concerns about the coronavirus, to have the candidates square off from separate locations next Thursday rather than onstage in Miami. In response, aides to Mr. Biden said the Democratic presidential nominee would “find an appropriate place to take questions from voters directly” that evening — and the campaign did not hesitate to follow through. A quick series of conversations between ABC News and the Biden campaign led to the network’s announcement of a town hall in Philadelphia with Mr. Biden next Thursday, to be moderated by the anchor George Stephanopoulos. The move by Mr. Biden’s team effectively ended the possibility of the second official debate’s going forward as planned, and it appeared to lock Mr. Trump into the position he took early Thursday to shun next week’s virtual forum. Mr. Trump, whose recent contraction of the coronavirus was a significant impetus for the commission to modify its plans, had immediately dismissed the idea of a remote debate as “ridiculous” and accused the commission without evidence of seeking to protect his Democratic opponent. “No, I’m not going to waste my time on a virtual debate,” Mr. Trump told the Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo. “That’s not what debating is all about. You sit behind a computer and do a debate — it’s ridiculous.” His apparent withdrawal led to a daylong back-and-forth between the Biden and Trump campaigns over when, where and on what terms the two candidates might meet again before Election Day. Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, perhaps sensing some political disadvantage to skipping the remaining debates, said the president would agree to another matchup if it were delayed a week and held in person on Oct. 22 — a move that could give Mr. Trump more time to recover from the coronavirus. Mr. Stepien also proposed an additional debate on a new date, Oct. 29. Kate Bedingfield, a Biden deputy campaign manager, quickly rejected that proposal. “Donald Trump doesn’t make the debate schedule; the debate commission does,” she said in a statement. “Trump chose today to pull out of the Oct. 15 debate. Trump’s erratic behavior does not allow him to rewrite the calendar, and pick new dates of his choosing.” Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., a co-chairman of the debate commission, said on CNN that the commission hoped to move ahead with the debate that was scheduled for Oct. 22 in Nashville, and that the event could be held in person “depending on the medical advice we receive.” But he said he had not yet heard from the Trump campaign about whether it would commit to the debate. The debate commission did not consult with the Biden and Trump campaigns before announcing the virtual format early Thursday. The decision was made after members of the commission’s production team objected to the safety risks of staging another in-person event at an indoor venue, according to a person familiar with its deliberations. The contretemps may pose the most significant test to the debate commission’s legitimacy since the group, a nonpartisan body, was founded in 1987. No law requires presidential candidates to take part in debates. Traditions and norms govern the practice, and like many political institutions in recent years, the commission’s board now faces its own Trumpian stress test. Newton N. Minow, 94, a member of the commission who has been involved in every general-election debate since 1960, said on Thursday that the day’s developments amounted to “a big loss to the democratic process.” “American voters are the losers — deprived of the opportunity to see, hear and evaluate presidential candidates through today’s technology,” Mr. Minow, who was appointed chairman of the Federal Communications Commission by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, wrote in an email. Directors of the debate commission include former senators, business luminaries and the Rev. John I. Jenkins, the president of the University of Notre Dame, who tested positive for the coronavirus last week. The commission was already under pressure to change its safety protocols after last week’s debate in Cleveland, where Mr. Trump’s family and aides declined to wear masks in the debate hall, flouting regulations set by the organizers. Mr. Biden’s aides had expressed concern about their candidate’s potential exposure to a president who could still be infectious. Mr. Trump, in the Fox Business interview, said he learned of the change to a virtual format on Thursday. But there were indications that people in the president’s circle were aware on Wednesday of the debate commission’s thinking about a virtual debate. The president also sought repeatedly to undermine the integrity of the debate commission. With no evidence, he accused the scheduled moderator of the next debate, Steve Scully of C-SPAN, of being a “never Trumper.” He said the moderator of the first debate, Chris Wallace of Fox News, “was a disaster” who favored Mr. Biden. And he said the commission’s plan for a remote matchup was about “trying to protect Biden.” In fact, a presidential debate with candidates in different locations is not unprecedented. In 1960, the third debate between Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon was held remotely. Kennedy debated from a television studio in New York; Nixon appeared from Los Angeles, with the men filmed on a pair of identical sets. The moderator of that debate, Bill Shadel of ABC News, conducted the proceedings from a third studio in Chicago. How to safely stage a pair of indoor, in-person debates between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump, who tested positive for the coronavirus last week and spent three days at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, has been the subject of intense conversations among board members of the debate commission in recent days. Aides to Mr. Trump had privately discussed the notion of debates held outdoors, but people familiar with the commission’s deliberations said the Trump campaign had never formally proposed that idea. The Biden campaign initially said it would welcome a virtual debate next Thursday, which was to follow a town-hall-style format with questions from Florida voters. But Mr. Stepien, the president’s campaign manager, issued a blistering attack against the commission, calling its members “swamp monsters” and describing the move to a virtual debate as “pathetic.” “The safety of all involved can easily be achieved without canceling a chance for voters to see both candidates go head to head,” Mr. Stepien said in a statement. “We’ll pass on this sad excuse to bail out Joe Biden and do a rally instead.” He also claimed that Mr. Trump “will have posted multiple negative tests prior to the debate,” although White House officials have repeatedly declined to give details about Mr. Trump’s current health status. The president has not yet tested negative for the virus. Patricia Mazzei contributed reporting. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
