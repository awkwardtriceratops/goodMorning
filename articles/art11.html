What Does That Mean?<br></h1><p id="artcont">Will we see a cohesive conservative alliance? Or a disparate group of conservative justices? By Linda Greenhouse Contributing Opinion Writer We may not yet know who won the presidential election, but everyone knows that the Supreme Court now has a conservative 6-to-3 majority. And that the Senate’s Republican majority’s hardball tactics, driven by blatant cynicism, achieved that result during an amazingly compressed period of not even six weeks — from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death in mid-September until Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s installation a week before Election Day. For most of the period, culminating with the new justice’s klieg-lit nighttime photo op with the president on what I’ve taken to calling the White House’s Mussolini balcony, the question was, “Can this really be happening?” Now comes the next question: What does it mean to have a bloc of six? By that, I’m not suggesting there won’t be conservative outcomes in case after case. There will be. Nor am I suggesting that when the Supreme Court decides a case, the bottom line doesn’t matter. Of course it does. But the route the court takes to reach that bottom line is also highly consequential. By choosing one and not another, the court validates some lines of legal argument and forecloses others, with profound implications for the next round of cases. And when the routes to a common destination diverge — when the majority fractures over what theory to invoke or how far to run with it — it will raise questions about what message the court is sending and what it is prepared to say or do next. The first day of the current term, Oct. 5, offered a powerful example. All eight justices who were then sitting agreed not to hear an appeal from Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who, in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision on the right of same sex couples to marry, claimed a religious right not to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples. The justices’ refusal to hear the appeal left intact a federal appeals court’s ruling that Ms. Davis is not entitled to immunity from suit by two same-sex couples she had turned away. The Supreme Court’s action, one of hundreds of similar denials the same day, might have attracted little attention except for an unusual “statement” issued by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. They had dissented from the court’s same-sex marriage decision, Obergefell v. Hodges, and their four-page statement was a shrill irredentist attack on what they labeled “this court’s alteration of the Constitution.” The two said they agreed that Ms. Davis’s appeal in its current preliminary posture was unsuitable for Supreme Court review. But they went on to say: Nevertheless, this petition provides a stark reminder of the consequences of Obergefell. By choosing to privilege a novel constitutional right over the religious liberty interests explicitly protected in the First Amendment, and by doing so undemocratically, the court has created a problem that only it can fix. There are a few things to note about this. Chief Justice John Roberts, himself a vigorous dissenter from Obergefell, didn’t sign the statement. Neither did Justices Neil Gorsuch or Brett Kavanaugh, two appointees of President Trump who were not on the court that decided Obergefell. Of five conservative justices, then, three chose not to put the court’s adherence to the precedent in play a month before the presidential election, while two picked precisely that moment to make a gratuitous and astonishingly aggressive move.
