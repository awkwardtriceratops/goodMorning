By The Editorial Board The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. Just $15,615. That’s how much a $52 billion meatpacking company was fined by the federal government for unsafe conditions that led to the deaths of eight workers. Even as the dangers and virulence of the coronavirus have become more glaring, infecting 6.5 million Americans and killing nearly 200,000, the nation’s top worker protection arm has been asleep at the wheel. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued only guidelines, rather than establish enforceable rules, for businesses that rushed to reopen when they were deemed essential early in the pandemic, putting hundreds of thousands of employees in workplaces where the virus could easily spread. Now, after six months of near silence on the issue, OSHA has begun issuing fines for the meatpacking industry, which is responsible for some of the nation’s largest coronavirus outbreaks. But if the agency’s first major actions are meant to chasten corporate America, executives aren’t likely to get the message. At the Greeley, Colo., Swift beef plant where eight workers have died from the effects of coronavirus, OSHA found that the operator, JBS Foods, failed to maintain a safe working environment. In a statement Friday night, OSHA also cited the company’s lack of timely disclosures about illness and injuries after a May inspection. Also last week, OSHA slapped the wrist of Smithfield Foods, which in April was forced to close its Sioux Falls, S.D., plant to help contain an outbreak that ultimately killed four workers and infected about 1,300. The company initially sued to prevent OSHA from examining documents. Smithfield, the world’s largest pork producer, even caught the attention of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which cited densely packed workers and inconsistent testing regimens.
