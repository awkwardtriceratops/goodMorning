He has also made misleading assertions in attacking his Democratic rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr. By Linda Qiu President Trump toured Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday, to survey damage caused by the unrest that followed the police shooting of a Black man in the city last week. He discussed some of the same topics at a news conference on Monday. Here’s a fact check of his remarks. WHAT MR. TRUMP SAID “My administration coordinated with the state and local authorities to very, very swiftly deploy the National Guard.” — in a round table in Kenosha on Tuesday

“If I didn’t INSIST on having the National Guard activate and go into Kenosha, Wisconsin, there would be no Kenosha right now.” — in a tweet on Monday False. Mr. Trump is taking undue credit for the relative calm that has settled this week over Kenosha, a city roiled by protests and violence last week. The governor, not the president, sent the National Guard to Kenosha. And the presence of guardsmen was not the sole factor in tamping down the violence. On Sunday, Aug. 23, a white police officer shot and partially paralyzed Jacob Blake in front of his children. Protesters, reacting to the shooting, clashed with police officers, smashed car windows and set fires and officers dispersed the crowds with tear gas and rubber bullets. On Monday, Aug. 24, Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin authorized the state National Guard to support local law enforcement. Protesters and police continued to clash, and city officials later described that Monday as the peak of the chaos and “our big night.” A day later, Mr. Trump urged Mr. Evers to send the National Guard, even though he had already done so. Mr. Evers declared a state of emergency and increased the size of the guard deployment to 250. Two men were killed and another seriously injured in shootings. Sheriff David Beth of Kenosha County noted the presence of out-of-town counterprotesters that night and said they “create confrontation” and “that doesn’t help us.” Mr. Beth also said tactics like securing cooperation from local residents and blocking off interstate highways proved to be effective in reducing the violence. Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Illinois who signaled support for pro-police causes, was arrested in the killings on Wednesday morning. The Justice Department sent about 200 federal agents to the city that night. Protests continued, but Mr. Beth said they were “very peaceful.” Mr. Evers again increased the number of National Guard members deployed to Kenosha on Thursday. The governors of Arizona, Michigan and Alabama also sent National Guard troops to Kenosha, after Mr. Evers requested their assistance as part of a mutual aid compact. Protests that night were “much calmer, much safer,” Daniel Miskinis, the Kenosha police chief, said in a news conference on Friday. At the same news conference, Maj. Gen. Paul E. Knapp, who commands the Wisconsin National Guard, noted that about 1,000 members of the state’s guard were on the scene and said it was the governor who made the final call on the guard’s deployment. WHAT MR. TRUMP SAID “I mean, you look at Minneapolis, they should have acted much quicker. When we got the National Guard in there, it took literally half an hour. You saw the scene. They formed, they walked, it was over and they haven’t had a problem of any consequences since.”
— at the Tuesday round table False. Again Mr. Trump is taking undue credit for relative calm in Minneapolis, after protests over the police shooting and death of George Floyd.
