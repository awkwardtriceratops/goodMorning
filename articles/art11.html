Williams also said he raised concerns about Louis DeJoy, the embattled postmaster general, before he was hired. By Nicholas Fandos, Alan Rappeport, Kenneth P. Vogel and Catie Edmondson WASHINGTON — The former vice chairman of the U.S. Postal Service’s board of governors accused Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday of trying to engineer a hostile takeover of the service, telling lawmakers that Mr. Mnuchin required members of the independent board to “kiss the ring” before they were confirmed and issued demands that agency officials believed were “illegal.” In scathing testimony delivered before lawmakers in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, David C. Williams, a former Postal Service inspector general who resigned as vice chairman in protest in April, said the Trump administration appeared to want to turn the agency into a “political tool.” The Treasury Department, he said, was maneuvering to use its lending authority to strong-arm the agency to adopt policies that would be “ruinous,” like raising prices and cutting back crucial services. “If this is the beginning of what the president promised, it’s the end of the Postal Service,” Mr. Williams said in his first public comments since his resignation. Mr. Williams, whose testimony came before a Senate hearing on Friday with the embattled postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, issued a blistering assessment of the new Postal Service leader. Mr. Williams, a Democrat appointed to the bipartisan board by President Trump, told lawmakers that Mr. DeJoy, a major donor to Mr. Trump and other Republicans, “didn’t strike me as a serious candidate” during interviews with him and other governors. When he departed the board, on the eve of Mr. DeJoy’s selection, Mr. Williams said that no serious background investigation had been conducted — despite his request for one — and that a brief review by the agency’s inspector general had surfaced potential concerns about contract work Mr. DeJoy’s logistics firm had done for the Postal Service. John M. Barger, the Republican board member who led the search process and whom Mr. Williams identified as having worked to advance Mr. DeJoy’s candidacy, disputed many of Mr. Williams’s claims in an interview. He asserted that Mr. Williams did not object to Mr. DeJoy’s hiring during the selection process. And he said Mr. DeJoy’s finances and corporate connections were subject to “extensive” review by the Postal Service’s general counsel, the Office of Government Ethics and a private security firm. “Everything checked out,” he said. The accusations come as the Postal Service is embroiled in a political firestorm, with cost-cutting and other operational changes — such as reduced overtime for mail carriers — causing widespread delays in the mail system and raising concerns about the ability of voters to use mail-in ballots during the coronavirus pandemic. Those worries have been fueled by Mr. Trump, who has derided the Postal Service as a “joke” and repeatedly raised questions about the legitimacy of mail-in voting. “The honorable thing to do is drop the Mail-In Scam before it is too late!” Mr. Trump said on Twitter last week. Lawmakers, concerned about potential politicization of the Postal Service, have summoned Mr. DeJoy to testify in hearings before the Senate on Friday and the House on Monday. Mr. DeJoy plans to offer a detailed defense of his rocky tenure, justifying disruptive operational changes as long-planned and well-considered attempts to balance the postal budget and assuring lawmakers that the agency is fully prepared to handle November’s election. According to prepared remarks submitted before Friday’s hearing and obtained by The New York Times, he planned to say that those actions meant to improve efficiency were unfairly twisted for political ends to suggest, incorrectly, that Republicans wanted to use the mail to help erode confidence in the election. “I recognize that it has become impossible to separate the necessary long-term reform efforts we will need to undertake from the broader political environment surrounding the election,” Mr. DeJoy plans to tell senators. “And I do not want to pursue any immediate efforts that might be utilized to tarnish the Postal Service brand, particularly as it relates to our role in the democratic process.” Thursday’s hearing centered in part on the role played by Mr. Mnuchin, one of Mr. Trump’s longest-serving cabinet members, who has been focused on overhauling the Postal Service. Mr. Trump assigned the Treasury secretary in 2018 to lead a task force to study ways to reform the Postal Service, which the president has accused of essentially subsidizing e-commerce companies such as Amazon by charging too little. He has demanded higher shipping prices. Mr. Mnuchin on Thursday rebutted suggestions that he had done anything but play a proper role as the federal government’s lender to the Postal Service and in fulfilling his duty to try to help fix its financial woes. In a letter to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, Mr. Mnuchin explained his role as the chairman of the Federal Financing Bank, the Postal Service’s sole lender, and said he did not intervene to pave the way for Mr. DeJoy to be the postmaster general. “Neither I nor any other Treasury official played any role in recruiting or suggesting Mr. DeJoy for the position of postmaster general,” Mr. Mnuchin wrote, adding that he was surprised to learn about the selection. Mr. Williams offered a starkly different picture of Mr. Mnuchin’s actions. He said the secretary sought to use his lending authority to win guarantees that he could approve postal price changes, labor agreements and service agreements negotiated with some of the agency’s largest customers like Amazon, UPS and FedEx. He said the board balked at Mr. Mnuchin’s demands, and he argued at the time that “a department cannot impose its will on another department.” “The postal general counsel sent a letter saying that the transfer of our duties and decision-making authority to him was illegal,” he told lawmakers. “The Treasury went forward notwithstanding that.” Updated August 17, 2020 Mr. Williams had served for 13 years as the Postal Service’s inspector general before he was tapped as a Democratic appointee to the Republican-controlled board. A former Army intelligence officer, he had worked in similar watchdog roles at a handful of other agencies before that. Mr. Williams did not directly tie Mr. Mnuchin to the search for a new postmaster general, but he described a process that left him so uneasy he felt he had no choice but to quit. The board of governors retained two outside firms, Chelsea Partners and Russell Reynolds Associates, to help facilitate the search. But Mr. Williams said he believed it was Mr. Barger who put Mr. DeJoy’s name into the mix “late in the process” and then championed his selection. He said he did not know how the two men met. Mr. Barger said Mr. DeJoy’s name was included in a database of people being assessed by Russell Reynolds. But Mr. Barger said Mr. DeJoy was elevated into contention based on a recommendation by Robert M. Duncan, the chairman of the board of governors and a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. Mr. Williams called Mr. DeJoy’s interviews with the governors a disaster and said he raised concerns at the time. The candidate spent the first interview asking questions of the board members, not the other way around, prompting one governor to joke that they had better ask him at least one question or the session might not qualify as an interview. Mr. Williams said the second session “went especially badly.” Mr. Barger, he recalled, repeatedly stepped into to clarify what Mr. DeJoy meant to say. He said that Mr. DeJoy was the only candidate the board interviewed who appeared to be unqualified for the job. Mr. Barger said that all the candidates who made it to the interview round of the selection process asked questions of the board. He said he did not recall helping Mr. DeJoy answer questions, and he said Mr. DeJoy’s selection was unanimous, including a vote from Ron A. Bloom, a Democratic appointee to the board. Mr. DeJoy began the job in June and has quickly come under intense scrutiny for his continuing financial ties to his previous employer, which does business with the Postal Service, as well as cost-cutting initiatives that have slowed mail delivery. Lawmakers of both parties, along with civil rights groups and state attorneys general, have raised concerns about the operational changes given the growing likelihood that many Americans will need to vote by mail in November because of the pandemic. Mr. DeJoy said on Tuesday that he would suspend some of the changes, but he has not committed to Democrats’ demands that he reverse some that are already in place, like the removal of hundreds of mail-sorting machines. Democrats are now trying to use Congress’s power to force him to do so and infuse $25 billion in emergency funding into the beleaguered agency, which has been rattled by the pandemic. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
