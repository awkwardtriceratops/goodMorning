Schultz Mr. Schultz, a partner in a Washington law firm, was the deputy commissioner for policy at the Food and Drug Administration from 1994 to 1999. The Food and Drug Administration is about to make the most momentous decision in its history: whether to authorize the early use of a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus without the normal safety and effectiveness protocols. This is happening against the backdrop of the presidential election season, in which the pandemic has become a fraught political issue for the Trump administration. The wrong decision could seriously undermine efforts to prevent the spread of this deadly virus. Significant risk may be acceptable for drugs intended to treat patients with serious, life-threatening diseases. The F.D.A. will approve a cancer drug with significant side effects, for instance, if it is demonstrated that the drug may prolong the life of the patient. But for a vaccine, the agency has always demanded a higher level of assurance of safety, for a simple reason: The vaccine will be given to healthy people. In 2004, Congress authorized the F.D.A. to issue emergency authorizations for medical products with less evidence of safety and efficacy than is ordinarily required. The theory was that, in a national emergency, it may be necessary to relax stringent standards to fast-track a potentially risky but lifesaving medical product. Under this lower standard, if the F.D.A. finds that a product “may be effective” and that its potential benefits outweigh its risks, the agency can authorize its emergency use. But this discretion also means that the agency should not authorize a vaccine if its use could undermine public health — in other words, when it could do more harm than good.
