Students coming back to classrooms face social distancing requirements and the risk of outbreaks and emergency quarantines. We talked to students around the country about the excitement, and anxiety, of a first day like no other. Supported by Students across the country discussed math, masks and managing anxiety as the year begins. By Dan Levin Photographs by The New York Times Lucas Fonte’s first day of virtual third grade was a virtual flop. There was no exciting wait for the school bus or morning greeting from the bus driver, Mrs. Rodriguez. Instead, the talkative eight-year-old put on his school uniform shirt, sat down next to his mother and brother at the dining room table and tried to log on to the Miami-Dade Public School district’s new online learning platform. Suddenly an image appeared on his laptop: “Oops. Request Blocked.” It was not just Lucas having problems. The entire district had been hit by a cyberattack, so his teachers asked every student to log onto Zoom. This was not how Lucas and his brother Logan, 6, wanted to begin the new school year at North Beach Elementary in Miami Beach, Fla. Last spring, the brothers struggled with the challenges of remote learning: sitting still for hours, staying focused on lessons while classmates talked over one another, depending on their parents for extra help. Now, those challenges are back in session. “I hope my math teacher is better on Zoom this year,” he said. “I don’t really think my mom understands it.” For Lucas, who was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the new school year is clouded by a pandemic that he is too young to fully grasp, but knows he cannot change. All he can do is wait for the school bus to arrive once again. For tens of millions of American students returning to class in some form or another amid the coronavirus pandemic, that first day ritual is tinged with anxiety, if not fear, as they begin an academic year unlike any other. Remote learners are confronting more days at home stuck to computer screens. Students back in classrooms face social distancing restrictions and the risk of outbreaks and emergency quarantines. Some students are starting new schools virtually, with little opportunity to turn the new faces on webcams into real friends. In interviews, students across the country shared what they were looking forward to and worried about as the new school year began. WILMINGTON, DEL. Since it’s a new school, I don’t have any friends there. I know one person because we went to the same middle school, but everyone’s going to be new to me. I really don’t think this year I’m going to make as many friends as I did in other schools. It’s just not going to be the normal experience. I want to make friends, but I don’t want to risk anything. MISSOULA, MONT. I was working with Missoula Parks and Rec. this summer as a junior camp counselor, so I’ve already had to wear a mask for a very long period of time. I already know the symptoms of Covid-19 off the top of my head to be able to do a self-check in the morning. I’m going to miss swim meets and recess at school, and how we all can just be so close and hug each other. I feel like that’s going to to be really hard for me. CHILLICOTHE, OHIO I’m nervous about multiplication — what if the teacher asks me and I don’t know the answer? But I’m most worried about corona, that some kids might get it and I might get it too. I’m going to use hand sanitizer and wear masks. LOUISVILLE, KY. We’re a very diverse school, we often have debates in certain classes, like English and history. I’m looking forward to those discussions because as I’ve seen through social media, a lot of people from my school are very vocal about what’s going on right now and what has happened. My grandfather taught me at a very young age about all the things that Columbus did and why he’s not to be celebrated. I have learned a lot more though over these past few months. People are talking about more things that aren’t talked about in school that should be.
