By Sopan Deb and Marc Stein RIGHT NOW Jimmy Butler ends the first half with a 3-pointer. The Heat lead, 60-56. The Los Angeles Lakers are one win away from a championship in their N.B.A. finals series against the Miami Heat. A win would give the Lakers a record-tying 17th championship, but the Heat have shown their resilience and, especially in Jimmy Butler’s case, their relentlessness in the face of daunting odds. But the Lakers’ LeBron James, who is going for his fourth ring, and Anthony Davis, who is going for his first, are motivated to end the series tonight. Click here to refresh for live updates. James has 21 points and is 9 of 11 from the field with 2:03 left in the first half. He’s also 3 of 4 from 3-point range, while the rest of the Lakers are just 2 of 8. For Miami, Jimmy Butler is leading with 17 points on 6 of 8 shooting from the field. Also notable: Duncan Robinson (10 points) and Kendrick Nunn (11 points). One win away from the 17th championship in franchise history, the Lakers were immediately confronted by a major scare when Anthony Davis sustained an injury to his right foot while challenging for a rebound late in the opening quarter. Davis has a habit of getting shaken up often and finding a way to play through it, which has to give the Lakers some comfort. But Davis looked to be in distress, clutching at his right foot, and that situation — more than an early 25-24 deficit — is surely the Lakers’ immediate concern. The good news for the Lakers: As quiet as the AdventHealth Arena fell after Davis went down and then hobbled to the Lakers’ bench, he did not leave the court to go to the locker room. Davis led the Lakers with 8 points in the opening quarter and opened the second quarter on the bench — but still with his teammates rather than seeking treatment from the team’s medical staff out of view. The Lakers said Davis re-aggravated a heel contusion that has bothered him at various points in these playoffs, but Davis is expected to return. The Lakers will be wearing their ‘Mamba’ jerseys, a black version with a snakeskin pattern in honor of the former franchise great Kobe Bryant, who died in a helicopter crash in January. Miami will again be without guard Goran Dragic, who tore the plantar fascia ligament in his left foot in Game 1 and has been out since. He tried to warm up before Game 4 but was not able to play. Bam Adebayo, who injured his neck in Game 1 and missed two games, was back for Game 4. He is in the starting lineup tonight. By Sopan Deb China Central Television, the state-run TV network, announced Friday that it would televise an N.B.A. game for the first time since a dispute with the league began last fall after a team executive expressed support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The move suggested a softening of tensions between the N.B.A. and China that the league estimated had cost it hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and that elicited criticism from fans and politicians. The change was to begin with Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat on Friday night. “On the morning of October 10, the channel of CCTV Sports will broadcast the fifth game of the N.B.A. finals,” the network said in a post in Chinese on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform. “Welcome everyone to watch at the time!” Find out why China made the change now. Before the season, Marc Stein talked to Butler about his road to stardom in the N.B.A. Butler has done a lot of changing since his arrival in the N.B.A. as the 30th overall pick of the Chicago Bulls in 2011. He blossomed into a four-time All-Star with a reputation as a hypercompetitive and demanding teammate, unafraid to also challenge coaches, team executives, whomever. In an interview with Yahoo Sports last season, Butler acknowledged that he could rightly be described as “confrontational.” He has also described himself as “a little extra at times.” Butler said he does what he wants, despite what people may think of him. As he prepares to begin his new work life with the Heat, Butler is pushing back harder against those around the N.B.A. who have criticized him for how much he has changed from his early days in the league. Back then, he was known as a coach-pleaser who liked to accentuate his Texas roots by wearing cowboy boots and oversize belt buckles, and listening to country music. “I like it,” Butler said of the knock that he has changed too much. “I am different. I’ve picked up a lot of different hobbies. I don’t want to stay the same. “I do what makes me happy. Some people just don’t like it. Some people just don’t want people to be happy.” Read more: By Marc Stein This has never been the month that basketball players were meant to peak. October is for baseball glory, and there can only be one Mr. October. By swatting three home runs on three consecutive swings in Game 6 of the 1977 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Reggie Jackson cemented one of the most fitting, enduring nicknames in all of sports. In 2020, of course, little proceeds as we expected. LeBron James is chasing one more win for his fourth N.B.A. championship at Walt Disney World at the same time Jackson’s beloved Yankees are scuffling with the Tampa Bay Rays in the American League Divisional Series at a neutral site in San Diego. The schedule glut across so many sports has posed an unexpected quandary for Mr. October, since Jackson is also an unabashed LeBron James fan. “I enjoy watching him as much as I do the baseball,” Jackson said. “The basketball is winding down, so if they’re both on at the same time, I’m going to be flipping back to baseball, because I’m going to be on the basketball. You need to see this guy.” Click here to read more, including whether Jackson thinks James is the G.O.A.T. If the Los Angeles Lakers beat Miami in the finals, LeBron James and Danny Green can join John Salley and Robert Horry on the short list of players to win championships with three  franchises. James is also bidding to become the first player to win an N.B.A. finals Most Valuable Player Award with three teams. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
