Your mileage may vary. By Nicole Pajer Deepak Chopra, the wellness and meditation star who has served as a spiritual adviser to Lady Gaga and is friends with the Dalai Lama, defines a disagreement as “a clash of egos.” In order to appropriately engage in a disagreement, then, the point cannot be to win it or change another’s opinion — “otherwise, they devolve into stubborn, angry arguments,” Mr. Chopra said. Instead, “disagreements exist as a place to start negotiating.” From his home in La Jolla, Calif., Mr. Chopra, 73, has been looking out at the anxious and angry state of the world and he’s not surprised. Some people may think this moment in time is the height of political and social division — with people baiting each other on social media, walking away from friendships, even splitting up with lovers over political polarization — but Mr. Chopra said our behavior is nothing new. “It’s been going on since the Stone Age,” he said. Still, after years of working in conflict resolution and mediating his fair share of quarrels between national leaders (which he, of course, must keep strictly confidential), Mr. Chopra does have some tips for disagreeing better. He should know: Mr. Chopra is not without critics ready to disagree with him, too. Over his career, the New Age celebrity and author of 91 books has clashed with scientists and doctors for championing alternatives to medicine and for statements that contradict accepted research. Even if his advice can’t help you change another person’s mind or behavior, it may help you stay calm on your end of a conflict. STEP 1 It’s useless to engage in certain debates. It’s highly unlikely that you are going to change someone’s mind if they still refuse to wear a face mask this far into 2020, for example. There are simply some confrontations that are not worth it. When these pop up, Mr. Chopra’s strategy is to walk in a different direction: “That’s it.” And as far as when to call it, he said: “There is no general rule to follow except this: Walk away any time you detect an impasse. Anything else is futile.” There are certain other tricky subjects, including religion and ideology, that Mr. Chopra said to refrain from when it comes to wading into arguments. (“Ideology is a fixed worldview,” he said. To be open-minded and tolerant “isn’t an ideology, as any sensible person knows.”)
