In the days of Trump, she was a bulwark. By Jennifer Weiner Contributing Opinion Writer Almost nine years ago, in early December, I took my younger daughter, Phoebe, to Disney World to celebrate her fifth birthday. If you’ve never been to the happiest place on earth around Christmas, you need to know two things. First: the entire place, from Adventureland to Epcot, is garlanded in Christmas wreaths and Christmas lights, a wonderland of green and red with Mickey and Minnie dressed as Santa and Mrs. Claus. The other thing you need to know is that Disney personnel refer to any female-presenting young person as “princess.” So there we were, in the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, where parents pay hundreds of dollars for the privilege of getting their kids “princess makeovers,” and Phoebe’s “fairy godmother in training” gave her a manicure and made small talk, asking, “Did you make your list for Santa yet, Princess?” I waited to see how my daughter would respond. I watched her think. Finally, Phoebe said: “I do not make a list for Santa. Because I am a Jewish princess.” I laughed and laughed. Then I explained to her that a Jewish Princess is something else entirely. It was hilarious. But that trip was also her first introduction to a lesson she will learn, over and over, in a thousand ways large and small: that she is different, that she’s the other, and always will be. I think about that day when I hear Donald Trump and his supporters talk about the “war on Christmas” (there isn’t one), or brag that “we’re saying Merry Christmas again” (“we” never stopped). I thought about it again when I read the obituary for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in The Guardian. Without offering any proof, the obituary asserted that Justice Ginsburg had “abandoned her religion” at 17, when she found herself excluded because of her gender from the minyan, or group of 10 observant Jews, who said the prayer for the dead for her mother. American Jews were quick to push back against the newspaper. R.B.G. attended services — at least, occasionally. She spoke openly and proudly about her Judaism. She kept a mezuza, or a prayer scroll, on the door of her chambers, and an Old Testament quotation on her wall. After an outpouring of complaints, The Guardian adjusted the article’s language to say that although the justice “moved away from strict religious observance” she “nevertheless remained deeply committed to her Jewish identity.”
