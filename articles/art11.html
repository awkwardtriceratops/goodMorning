By Neil Vigdor The University of South Carolina took disciplinary action on Monday against more than a dozen students and several Greek life organizations that administrators said recently hosted parties or large gatherings, as the number of cases of the coronavirus on campus rises. The university announced that 15 students had been placed under interim suspension and that six Greek houses had been charged with student conduct violations stemming from the parties, which officials said violated emergency orders in Columbia, S.C. Administrators did not release the names of the students. They also did not say which fraternities or sororities had been reprimanded. The action came as nearly half of the fraternity and sorority chapter houses in the university’s Greek Village — nine of 20 — were placed under a 14-day quarantine after some students in those houses tested positive for the virus, administrators said. Bob Caslen, the university’s president, admonished the actions of the students in a message to the university’s faculty and staff that will be sent out Tuesday morning. Part of the message was provided to The New York Times.
