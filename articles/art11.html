By Kyle Buchanan “Citizen Kane” has cast a vast cinematic shadow for nearly eight decades, sitting atop countless lists of the greatest films ever made. And somehow, it only won a single Academy Award. Though Orson Welles’s directorial debut came up stunningly short at the 1942 Oscar ceremony where John Ford’s “How Green Was My Valley” took the trophies for best picture and best director, the one thing “Citizen Kane” did get recognized for — its screenplay — is the subject of Netflix’s lavish new film “Mank,” directed by David Fincher. Will “Mank” manage what “Citizen Kane” couldn’t and nab those two top Oscars? In a pandemic-pruned awards season, it has the look of a potential juggernaut. Due Dec. 4 on Netflix after a limited theatrical release on Nov. 13, “Mank” tells the story of the Hollywood writer Herman Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman), who’s been tasked by wunderkind Welles with crafting “Citizen Kane.” For Mankiewicz, taking this screenplay job will involve some burnt bridges, as “Kane” is a thinly veiled take on the businessman William Randolph Hearst, whom Mankiewicz knows all too well. As the film tells it, years earlier, Mankiewicz was a habitué of Hearst’s glittery parties, where the screenwriter brandished bon mots and forged a connection with Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried), Hearst’s much younger mistress. But drinking and disillusionment caused Mankiewicz to fall out of Hearst’s favor — and Hollywood’s, too. Can he redeem himself by capitalizing on the offer from Welles and writing his greatest work? Despite its single win, “Citizen Kane” still managed nine Oscar nominations, and I’d expect at least that many for “Mank.” In a year bereft of major action spectaculars and blockbuster theatrical releases, “Mank” has the opportunity to cut a wide swath through the technical categories, notching nods for its high-end production design, editing and costumes. After shooting episodes of Fincher’s Netflix show “Mindhunter,” the cinematographer Erik Messerschmidt could triumph in his very first Oscar race for sumptuous black-and-white photography meant to recall Hollywood’s golden age. (The last black-and-white film to win in the category was another Netflix contender, “Roma,” in 2019.) And the period-evocative monaural sound may also catch Oscar’s ear, as could the swinging score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, even though the duo will probably compete against their own work in Pixar’s music-driven “Soul.”
