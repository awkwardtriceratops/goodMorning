No Republican leader had more riding on these elections than Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader and the man responsible for recruiting many of the newly elected House Republicans. In a recent interview, Mr. McCarthy discussed the campaign, how the House is the political equivalent of a baseball farm system and what President Trump’s role in the party will be going forward. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. From a Republican vantage point, what does the election tell you about the parties and the country? We had challenges with women. We had a low number of women in Congress. It’s not just getting women to run; you’ve got to get through primaries. Do we look diverse like I believe our party to be? I don’t think Congress was reflective. So I spent more effort on recruitment, and I tried to do something different where I would engage early in the races. Because it’s harder for women and minorities to win in a primary than it is in a general election. House Republicans fared better in 2020, when Mr. Trump was on the ballot, than in the 2018 elections, when the president was not on the ballot. And yet in 2018, voters didn’t have Trump to vote against. They did this time. Why didn’t that hurt down-ballot races?
