Mayor’s Race<br></h1><p id="artcont">Business leaders encouraged Mr. McGuire to seek the Democratic nomination, saying his background would help the city and its economy recover from the pandemic. By Jeffery C. Mays For several months, as the pandemic has worsened New York City’s financial outlook, business leaders have cast around for one of their own to run for mayor next year. They offered their support and floated the possibility of tens of millions of dollars in campaign donations for the right candidate, someone  more favorable to the business community than the current mayor, Bill de Blasio, and with the financial background to keep the city solvent. That candidate has apparently emerged. Raymond J. McGuire, one of the highest-ranking and longest-serving Black executives on Wall Street, will announce on Thursday that he is leaving his post at Citigroup to prepare for a run for the Democratic nomination for mayor, just eight months before the primary. Mr. McGuire, 63, a vice chairman at Citigroup, has been mulling a potential run for months. Although he is well known in the financial world — he was one of three finalists in 2018 to become president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York — he is far less known to voters, who must be persuaded to back a first-time candidate over more established rivals. He will also have to raise funds in a compressed amount of time; Mr. McGuire said that he would not participate in the city’s matching campaign finance system, allowing him to accept larger donations.
