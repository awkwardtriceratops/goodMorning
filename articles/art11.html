Decades later, her son discovered what she sacrificed. By William Lamb My mother saved an immense amount of stuff. That’s something of a burden: What to do with it all? But it’s also a gift. Because she died of cancer in 1992, at 53, when I was just 15. And yet she still finds ways to speak to me, through the things she left behind. One of those things — a pendant light I recently discovered — offered a clue to a life I didn’t realize she had. I first heard about it a few years ago, when I came across a yellowed envelope with a label bearing the stylized spiral logo of Wheel-Garon Inc., a now-defunct New York architectural lighting firm. I asked my father about it, and he told me the story. My mother, Helen Lamb, went to work there in early 1961, after answering an ad in the newspaper, he recalled. A newlywed, she had left her parents’ home in Alabama a few months earlier, less than a year after graduating from the University of Georgia. She was 22 years old. The firm, which was new, hired her as a draftsman, bookkeeper and typist on the basis of her bachelor’s degree in interior design and the five months she spent as a fabric designer and colorist after her arrival in New York. In short order, however, she worked her way up, Peggy Olson-style, into a role as a lighting designer. Wheel-Garon’s big client was Hilton Hotels. Sometime in 1962, the firm’s principals, Lesley Wheel and Martin Garon, entrusted her with an important project: designing a set of pendant lamps to hang above the blackjack and craps tables in the casino at the Caribe Hilton hotel in San Juan, P.R. It was possible, my father told me intriguingly, that one of those fixtures had survived and was in the attic of my childhood home, in Arlington, Va. My first effort to find the lamp — as my father and stepmother were getting ready to put the house on the market a year ago, in preparation for a move into independent living — was unsuccessful. Instead, I found boxes of other things my mother had saved: my report cards from grade school; all of my letters to Santa Claus; and a note she wrote to me on my 10th birthday, which reduced me to tears. But I also came across something else: a file folder overflowing with ephemera from my mother’s Wheel-Garon days, including business cards and a series of black-and-white photographs taken in the firm’s offices, with her sporting a pillbox-bob hairdo. And I found several crisply folded technical drawings of light fixtures, one labeled the San Juan. This prompted a longer conversation with my father, Denis Lamb. I was curious about how my mother, a young, inexperienced woman working in a field dominated by men, managed to find a measure of success so quickly. A lot of it, he said, had to do with Lesley Wheel. According to a 2001 profile in Architectural Lighting magazine, she was the first — and, for years, the only — woman to practice full time as an architectural lighting designer. Ms. Wheel, who died in 2004 and whom my father remembered as “a forceful, dynamic person,” took my mother under her wing. Mr. Garon did, too, to some extent, he said, “but Lesley — it may be because she was a woman — was more her patron there, more of her mentor than Garon was.”
