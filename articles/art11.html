The action in Warsaw on Friday was expected to be the biggest so far. By Anatol Magdziarz and Marc Santora WARSAW — Ignoring the threat of prosecution and dangers posed by the explosion of coronavirus cases, tens of thousands of women outraged by a court decision to ban nearly all abortions in Poland converged in Warsaw on Friday, expanding what have been the largest demonstrations in the country since the fall of communism in 1989. With a musical medley that included Darth Vader’s theme from Star Wars, in a poke at the government, and techno music blaring over loudspeakers, crowds of women flooded the streets of the capital, many of them with the red lightning bolt that has become the iconic image of the movement emblazoned on their clothes, as the police and military security officers flanked them in every direction. They were joined by thousands of men and a wide array of groups who believe that the hard-won freedoms of the post-communist era are slipping away under the rule of the increasingly autocratic Law and Justice Party. Friday’s march culminated a week of overwhelmingly peaceful protests. The police estimated that 430,000 people attended more than 400 demonstrations around the country on Wednesday. Protests of this scale have not been seen in the country since the Solidarity movement in the 1980s that led to the collapse of the Communist government, according to analysts, a measure of the discontent felt by many Poles over the high court decision on Oct. 22 to virtually ban abortion. “I’m here because my sense of helplessness has reached its peak,” said Anna Rabczuk, a graphic designer who attended with her boyfriend and held a banner saying “People before embryos.” “I feel unimportant, I feel less and less like a Pole and I feel really sad about that.” She said the ruling on abortion was part of a broader erosion of individual freedoms that she believes come with part of being a part of the European Union. The court’s decision halted pregnancy terminations for severe fetal abnormalities, effectively the only type of abortion currently performed in Poland. Abortions of pregnancies resulting from rape and those threatening the life of women are still formally legal. In the deeply religious country — where 33 million of the 38 million citizens are registered as Roman Catholic — the anger directed at the clergy has been one of the most striking aspects of the protests. “I feel a lot of hatred toward the church,” said Zuza Rawa, who was heading for a protest outside of the ruling party headquarters, one of several sites around the city targeted by demonstrators. Although baptized, she said she no longer feels part of an institution that was in dire need of reform. “I am terrified and this is the main reason why I’m here,” she said. “I don’t want to see my country in such condition.” The ruling party has used the attacks on the church to rally its own supporters. And some of Poland’s nationalist extremists have seized on the moment to form a self-proclaimed “national guard.” Young men clad in black and armed with pepper spray — many with shaved heads — have become a nightly presence outside churches and cathedrals. They have confronted protesters and a number of brawls have been reported near churches in Warsaw and elsewhere. Two female reporters from the nation’s largest daily newspaper, Gazeta Wyborca, reported they had been attacked. The mass gatherings have been held despite a surge in coronavirus cases in Poland, with more than 20,000 new infections now reported daily and hospitals struggling to deal with the influx of patients. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, speaking to the country Friday morning from a hastily constructed hospital on the grounds of the National Stadium on the banks of the Vistula river, sought to redirect attention to the pandemic and urged people to stay home. “Let your anger focus on me, on politicians, let it touch me but not those whom it can touch in two weeks,” he said. “Protesting ladies and gentlemen, you will get in touch with elderly people on the bus, at home or during a meeting. This may result in dramatic consequences.” Anatol Magdziarz reported from Warsaw, and Marc Santora from London.
