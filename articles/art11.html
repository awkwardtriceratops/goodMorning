Krug detailing a long history of deception about her racial identity. By Michael Levenson and Jennifer Schuessler George Washington University said on Thursday that it was looking into a blog post, written under the name of an associate professor of history, saying she had engaged in a yearslong deception by assuming various Black identities even though she is white. In the post, the author, Jessica A. Krug, wrote that she had eschewed her “lived experience as a white Jewish child in suburban Kansas City” and had assumed identities she had no right to claim. Those identities included “first North African Blackness, then US rooted Blackness, then Caribbean rooted Bronx Blackness,” she wrote in the piece on Medium, which was posted on Thursday morning. “For the better part of my adult life,” she wrote, “every move I’ve made, every relationship I’ve formed, has been rooted in the napalm toxic soil of lies.” Her assuming of a Black Caribbean identity, she wrote, was “not only, in the starkest terms, wrong — unethical, immoral, anti-Black, colonial — but it means that every step I’ve taken has gaslighted those whom I love.”
