By John Koblin After five years out of the TV spotlight, Jon Stewart will have his own show again. Mr. Stewart, the former anchor of “The Daily Show,” has reached a deal to host a current-affairs series for Apple TV+, the company announced on Tuesday. Apple TV+ said it had ordered the series for multiple seasons. It will feature one-hour episodes, each dedicated to a single topic. Apple did not describe the format — whether it would be an interview series or something closer to John Oliver’s weekly HBO series — or specify how many episodes it would have per season. Apple did not set a premiere date, either. But Apple did say that Mr. Stewart’s new show “will explore topics that are currently part of the national conversation and his advocacy work.” Mr. Stewart has been outspoken about the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, for instance. Mr. Stewart left Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” in 2015 after a deliriously successful run that started in 1999. His version of the show won the Emmy for best talk or variety series 11 times. In the years since he left, he has returned to television sporadically with appearances on Stephen Colbert’s CBS late-night show. (Mr. Stewart is a producer of that series.)
