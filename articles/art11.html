Also: Dangerous weather; and powerful images of midwives. By Jill Cowan Good morning. Tapping through Instagram stories is not where I expected to find the actor Seth Rogen looking very serious. And yet, there he has been over the last couple weeks, nodding solemnly as his wife, Lauren Miller Rogen, talks about Alzheimer’s research. A big block floating near their heads reads, “Yes on 14.” That’s Proposition 14, one of the dozen propositions on the statewide ballot this month. [Read more about what’s on this year’s statewide ballot.] The measure, which would put $5.5 billion in state bond money toward stem cell and other medical research, is not something most Californians are likely to have spent a lot of time thinking about. But it’s a fair illustration of California’s ever-evolving ballot proposition system at work, David McCuan told me. Mr. McCuan is a political-science professor at Sonoma State University who has studied California’s ballot initiatives for two decades. Historically, it’s been hard to get voters to say yes to the questions they’re posed on the statewide ballot, he said, whether they’re being asked to spend more money on something like stem cell research or to change laws made by the Legislature. But that’s been shifting. “We see things where the ‘yes’ side and the coalitions that form under initiative politics are becoming better learners,” he said. “Donors are strategic, and the ballot measure itself is specific about what it will do.” He said that as the strategy behind California’s propositions — the crafting of ballot language, the timing of ad spending — has become more sophisticated, the money behind them has become astronomical. “This is the second most expensive political exercise in the free world,” he said. “You’re looking at around $650 million so far for 12 ballot measures.” Compare that, he said, with $57 million — the record-breaking quarterly sum raised by Jaime Harrison, who’s challenging Senator Lindsey Graham in South Carolina.
