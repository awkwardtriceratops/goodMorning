By Mark Leibovich [Follow our live coverage of the 2020 election between President Trump and Joe Biden.] TAMPA, Fla. — As in-person spectacles go, Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s pandemic-era campaign appearances can resemble the pandemic-era N.F.L. — quiet, eerie and almost entirely fan-free. There is scant physical evidence that the former vice president and Democratic nominee is in town. His visits are scarcely publicized beforehand, logistical details are closely held and his event venues serve as much as video studios as places of gathering. Barely anyone is allowed near the candidate. “I had to call an editor friend of mine at The Tampa Tribune to find out where he’d be,” said Rita Fox, a supporter of Mr. Biden’s from St. Petersburg, Fla. She stood across the street from Raymond James Stadium, home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and near an entrance to Hillsborough Community College, where Mr. Biden was holding a veterans round-table event last week before about a dozen sanitized and socially distanced guests in a gymnasium whose bleachers remained folded up against the walls. No pull-asides, touching of the candidate or photos were permitted. These measures are taken to ensure maximum protection against the coronavirus, Mr. Biden’s campaign said. The productions also serve a strategic voter-outreach purpose, as they will typically draw significant local news coverage and be viewed online by tens of thousands of voters. And they comport with the general philosophy of a campaign that has ceased nearly all traditional means of in-person outreach, including door-knocking, mass distribution of signs and big rallies. As Mr. Biden has resumed campaigning in key battlegrounds, his visits have acquired a distinctly stealthy quality. This can be jarring for a candidate whose zeal for face-to-face campaigning, wading into crowds and lingering on rope lines is well known.
