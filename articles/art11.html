By Mark Arax Mr. Arax is a writer whose most recent book is “The Dreamt Land: Chasing Water and Dust Across California.” FRESNO, Calif. — I’ve lived in the middle of California for more than 50 years, which is another way of declaring my share of natural disasters. I’ve seen the land around me dragged through four long droughts, five big floods, a half-dozen earthquakes of 7.0 or higher and three of the 10 deadliest wildfires in U.S. history. I’m now sitting in my home in Fresno on the edge of another historic blaze, the Creek Fire, counting the days for it to peter out, waiting for our collective amnesia to set down again like ash, so that Californians can go on with the madness of building in the same path of wildfire. Figuring out this state isn’t easy. I’ve written more than a million words of history, memoir, essay, biography and journalism trying to get close. I’ve come to understand that the question of disaster and rebirth exists at the heart of our experiment. We’ve spent the past 170 years erecting a most intricate system — dams, aqueduct, canals, turbine pumps, power grids, roads, codes — to dull, if not defeat, nature. Yet California remains one of the most calamitous places on earth. Drought, flood, wildfire, mudslide, earthquake — it’s a hell of a way to run through the seasons. When we’re caught in the clutches of one disaster, we forget all about the possibility of another. We consider this failure of memory to be our resilience. It’s a powerful force to behold. William Brewer, who studied at Yale before coming west to survey California’s natural resources during the Gold Rush, watched the great deluge of 1862 erase the land. “Nearly every house and farm over this immense region is gone,” he reported. “America has never before seen such desolation by a flood as this has been.” Yet Brewer had come to recognize the Californian’s peculiar fortitude to outlast everything. “No people can so stand calamity as this people,” he wrote. “They are used to it. Everyone is familiar with the history of fortunes quickly made and as quickly lost. It seems here, more than elsewhere, the natural order of things.” My 22-year-old son, Jake, has outlasted the virus, the heat wave, the blackouts, the smoke and six months of lockdown by reading Dostoyevsky and Saroyan. He wonders if the wildfires herald the arrival of climate change. We talk existentialism over the hum of four machines that change our household air from “very unhealthy” to “good.” I remind him that California doesn’t need climate change to suffer disasters. We produce them quite fine on our own. Now that climate change has hitched aboard, we’ll see hazards we’ve never seen before. Last month, Death Valley experienced what is likely the hottest temperature — 130 degrees — ever recorded on earth. More than 10,000 dry lightning strikes hit the state in a three-day period. Not even the Pacific Gas & Electric company, whose greed and folly sparked the deadly wildfires of 2017 and 2018, made for such a willful setter of fires. The lightning lit 600 separate blazes, and we’ve seen more than three million acres scorched. There are, if it helps to think this way, 97 million more acres of California left to burn. California has always been too big for its breeches. The people, first Spaniard, then white American, took from the Indians a land mass near 1,000 miles long and then called it one state. Highest mountain, lowest desert, longest coast, most epic valley, riparian forest, Redwood forest, wetland, grassland, inland sea — each was its own state of nature. When the lines of latitude cover 10 degrees, and the rain falls 125 inches on one end and seven inches on the other, and the people choose to live where the water isn’t, what is a state to do? And so began the infinite tinkering to even out the differences.
