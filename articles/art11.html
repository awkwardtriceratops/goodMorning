By Tyler Kepner The Tampa Bay Rays told Charlie Morton it would happen. When they chased him as a free agent before last season, their front office did not present to him this precise scenario — an unprecedented path to the World Series, with him leading the way — but they shared their methodology. Part of Morton recoiled at the message. “‘Hey, we don’t need you to go seven, eight innings — we’re built so that you give us five or six good ones and we’ll take care of the rest,’” Morton, 36, said earlier this month, recalling the Rays’ pitch to him. “I don’t know how I feel about that; coming up, you want to go seven, eight. You want that complete game.” Morton’s role models as a young major leaguer were other tall right-handers who craved big moments and burned to work deep into games: Roy Halladay, Chris Carpenter, Adam Wainwright and A.J. Burnett. His generation of pitchers, Morton said, is probably the last to be raised with that mentality. “And you just see this evolution in the game — teams would rather have you go out and strike a bunch of guys out over five or six innings,” he added. “I don’t know, it’s kind of sad to see — but the guys that can consistently go out and give you six, seven, eight innings, two to four runs, and throw 200 innings a year, I think that’s gone the way of the dodo bird.” Nowhere was the evolution of the baseball kingdom more obvious than in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series on Saturday night in San Diego. The Rays stuck to their principles at the pivotal moment, and the reward was a 4-2 victory over the Houston Astros that sent them to their second World Series. In their first, in 2008, they lost to the Philadelphia Phillies. The Rays won the first three games of this A.L.C.S., then lost three in a row. Only once before had a team done that in a best-of-seven series, and that team — the 2004 Yankees — was beaten soundly in Game 7 by the Boston Red Sox. The Rays, then, had no precedent for recovering from such a tumble. “I don’t know if I went to bed,” Manager Kevin Cash said when asked about his torment after losing Game 6 on Friday. “It was tough, there’s no doubt. A lot of anxiety. Believe me, we’ve all watched ‘Four Days in October.’ I didn’t want to see it again.” Cash was referring to a documentary about Boston’s famous comeback; several Astros said they had watched it for inspiration as they attempted to match the feat. But Houston fell one win short, and Cash’s discipline with Morton was a big reason. Morton, who won Game 7s in the A.L.C.S. and the World Series for Houston in 2017, retired 16 of his first 17 hitters on Saturday and took a 3-0 lead into the sixth inning behind homers by Randy Arozarena and Mike Zunino. Morton was extremely efficient; after a walk and a two-out infield single in the sixth, he had thrown just 66 pitches, about two-thirds of a traditional starter’s workload.
