Supported by Photographs and Text by Ruth Fremson POINT ROBERTS, Wash. — A home that long seemed like paradise is lately beginning to feel more like Alcatraz. A five-square-mile drop of land clinging to the southern end of British Columbia with views of snow-capped Mt. Baker to the east and the San Juan Islands to the south, Point Roberts is detached from the rest of Washington State. Not far south of Vancouver, it is a relic of the Oregon Treaty in 1846, which set the northern border of what was then the Oregon Territory at the 49th parallel. To reach the rest of the United States from Point Roberts requires two international border crossings with a 24-mile drive in between. The isolation is both a blessing and a curse during a pandemic. Despite having no coronavirus cases to date, Point Roberts may be the last place in the United States to return to normal because the Canadian government has extended its border closure each month since shutting down on March 21. Only people with reasons deemed essential are allowed to cross, and the order has been strictly enforced. The few businesses in Point Roberts depend on cross-border commerce. Canadian tourists and seasonal residents, who quadruple the population during the summer months, generate about 90 percent of their annual income. Some of the 1,300 yearlong residents fear that if the closure continues, they may never reopen. Brian Calder, 79, whose family arrived in 1895, predicts that “Point Roberts is going to be a ghost town by mid-next year.”
