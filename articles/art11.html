Doesn’t Need to Hate Us to Destroy Us’<br></h1><p id="artcont">“I do not think this is actually the end of the world,” says Musk. But at the same time, we need to hurry up. “The longer we take to transition to sustainable energy, the greater the risk we take.” But is relocating to Mars really necessary? Is our species ready to live with chips in our brains? And who’s Musk voting for, anyway? Times Opinion is teaming up with Kara Swisher on a new podcast about power and influence. She’s taking on C.E.O.s, senators, actors and activists — plus upstarts and gatekeepers you might not yet know but need to hear from. How did these people get power? How do they actually use it? And how does their power shape your life? Every Monday and Thursday, from New York Times Opinion. Listen to the trailer.
