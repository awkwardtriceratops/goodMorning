By Sydney Ember, Thomas Kaplan and Katie Glueck During the vice-presidential debate last week, several issues came up, including the Supreme Court, climate change and taxes, that underscored the tightrope Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Kamala Harris are trying to walk as they seek to balance appeals to progressives and moderates alike. President Trump and Republicans have used these issues, in particular, in their attempt to paint Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris as prisoners of the party’s left wing, even as Mr. Biden, who has a substantial lead in the polls, has run as an unapologetic centrist. Still, some of the issues are among those Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris themselves disagreed on during the Democratic primary race, presenting a particularly thorny challenge for Ms. Harris as she tried to defend Mr. Biden on the debate stage against Republican attacks. Complicating matters for Mr. Biden is the pressure he continues to face from the left, which views him as an imperfect steward for the party. In fact, Mr. Biden has been reluctant to support transformative policies favored by the left, like expanding the size of the Supreme Court or supporting the Green New Deal. In recent weeks, he has refused to give an answer about his views on increasing the size of the Supreme Court, telling reporters on Thursday, “They’ll know my opinion on court-packing when the election is over,” a remark that incensed Republicans and left him looking evasive. On Saturday, he again dodged the question when asked about whether voters deserved to know his position before Election Day, saying, “The only packing going on is, this court is being packed now by the Republicans after the vote has already begun.” Certainly, there is no comparison between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump when it comes to consistency on policy or transparency, now or over the years. Just last week, Mr. Trump halted stimulus talks abruptly, and the White House is now seeking to revive them. And he and his team have been evasive or nonresponsive on a host of issues, from details of his health status to his own health care policy.
