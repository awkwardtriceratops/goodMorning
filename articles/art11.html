He appears to have played a significant role in the July 15 Twitter attack, investigators and fellow hackers said. By Nathaniel Popper When authorities arrested Graham Ivan Clark, who they said was the “mastermind” of the recent Twitter hack that ensnared Kanye West, Bill Gates and others, one detail that stood out was his age: He was only 17. Now authorities have homed in on another person who appears to have played an equal, if not more significant role, in the July 15 attack, according to four people involved in the investigation who declined to be identified because the inquiry was ongoing. They said the person was at least partly responsible for planning the breach and carrying out some of its most sensitive and complicated elements. His age? Just 16, public records show. On Tuesday, federal agents served the teenager with a search warrant and scoured the Massachusetts home where he lives with his parents, said one of the people involved in the operation. A spokesman for the FBI confirmed a search warrant had been executed at the address. The search warrant and other documents in the case are under seal and federal agents may decide not to charge the youth with a crime. If he is ultimately arrested, the case is likely to be handed over to Massachusetts authorities, who have more leverage than federal prosecutors in charging minors as adults. (The New York Times is not naming the teenager at this point because of his age and because he has not been charged.) Rarely have federal agents gone after someone so young in a hacking case, especially given the apparent sophistication of the attack. During the hack, much of Twitter — including President Trump’s unfiltered communications on the service — was largely immobilized. The attackers gained control of the social network’s systems and compromised the accounts of Barack Obama, Joseph R. Biden, Jeff Bezos and many other prominent people, exposing just how vulnerable Twitter could be. Authorities have already charged three other people in the hack. They include Mr. Clark, who Florida prosecutors charged in late July as an adult with 30 felonies. He has pleaded not guilty and has not made the bail payment to get out of jail. Two other people who played smaller roles in the hack — Mason John Sheppard, 19, of the United Kingdom, and Nima Fazeli, 22, of Orlando, Fla. — were also charged by federal prosecutors.
