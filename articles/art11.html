By Alex Marshall LONDON — Anna Netrebko, the star Russian soprano, is in the hospital with pneumonia caused by the coronavirus, she said in an Instagram post on Thursday. “I have been in the hospital for 5 days with Covid-19 and will recover soon,” Ms. Netrebko wrote, adding: “Everything will be fine! The devil is not so terrible as it is described.” She was admitted to a Moscow hospital just days after performing at the city’s Bolshoi Theater with another singer who later tested positive for the virus. Scientists have identified singing indoors as a risky activity, and the news will cause concern among the world’s opera companies, which had been closely watching the starry Bolshoi performances as they forged ahead. Maxim Berin, Ms. Netrebko’s Russian manager, said in a telephone interview that the soprano had been unwell since Sept. 9, but he said she was now recovering. “Doctors told me everything is fine, and now Anna has started to sing in hospital, which is why she made the post,” he said of her Instagram announcement. Ms. Netrebko, who lives in Vienna, had been in Russia since the start of September, Mr. Berin said. She performed with pianist Denis Matsuev, among others, in Moscow on Sept. 2. Then, on Sept. 6 and 8, she appeared at the Bolshoi in two performances of Verdi’s “Don Carlo,” the first opera at the venue since it was shuttered in March because of the pandemic.
