Al Jazeera suggested the move was part of a separate deal, signed on Tuesday and brokered by the Trump administration, in which the United Arab Emirates, a Qatari rival, normalized diplomatic relations with Israel. The Emirates ambassador to the United States said that was not true. In a letter dated Monday that was obtained by The New York Times, the Justice Department said that AJ+, a network that primarily produces short videos for social media in English as well as Arabic, French and Spanish, engages in “political activities” on behalf of Qatar’s government and should therefore be subject to the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Qatar, the letter said, provides the network’s funding and appoints its board of directors. “Journalism designed to influence American perceptions of a domestic policy issue or a foreign nation’s activities or its leadership qualifies as ‘political activities’ under the statutory definition,” said the letter, which was signed by Jay I. Bratt, the chief of the Justice Department’s counterintelligence division, “even,” the letter added, “if it views itself as ‘balanced.’” Mother Jones first reported the letter Tuesday afternoon. In a statement, Al Jazeera Media Network, AJ+’s parent organization, insisted that AJ+ was independent and therefore should not have to register as a foreign agent, and that it was “considering our options.” Al Jazeera also suggested that the move was related to the U.A.E.’s historic agreement to become just the third Arab-led country to normalize relations with Israel. “The U.A.E. has confirmed it presented the United States with preconditions prior to announcing the Abraham Accords, and we received D.O.J.’s letter the day before the U.A.E. signed the Accords,” said Al Jazeera’s statement, referring to the agreement signed Tuesday at the White House. “Hobbling Al Jazeera was one of the top conditions of the U.A.E.’s blockade against Qatar and the Justice Department just gave the U.A.E. what it wanted.” The Emirates’ ambassador to the United States, Yousef al-Otaiba, denied that the U.A.E. had pushed for the registration as part of the deal to warm relations with Israel. “At no point in our discussions was Al Jazeera or even Qatar raised,” Mr. al-Otaiba said in an email to The Times. He added, of Al Jazeera, “they’re really not as important as they think they are.” Qatar and the U.A.E., neighbors on the Persian Gulf, have been embroiled in a bitter geopolitical rivalry for several years. Three years ago, the U.A.E. imposed a blockade on the small country along with regional allies Bahrain, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Among the U.A.E.’s complaints with Qatar’s government is its funding of Al Jazeera, whose primary, Arabic-language television network was sympathetic to protesters in the region during the Arab Spring of 2011. A media consultant for the Embassy of Qatar in Washington declined to comment. But an official with knowledge of the matter said the administration’s order surprised Qatari diplomats who learned of it though news reports on Tuesday.
