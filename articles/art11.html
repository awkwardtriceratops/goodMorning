By Mark Guarino WAUKEGAN, Ill. — Kyle Rittenhouse, the Illinois teenager accused of killing two men during protests over a police shooting in Kenosha, Wis., will be tried in Wisconsin, a judge ruled on Friday. Lawyers for Mr. Rittenhouse, 17, had been fighting extradition from his home state ever since he was charged with six criminal counts, including first-degree intentional homicide, for the shootings on Aug. 25 that left two protesters dead and a third injured. The shootings occurred as fighting broke out between demonstrators, who were protesting a white officer’s shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black Kenosha resident, and armed civilians who said they were protecting businesses and private property after two nights of fires, looting and destruction. Mr. Rittenhouse, who has said he acted in self-defense, was transferred to a Kenosha County jail on Friday afternoon, according to local media reports.
