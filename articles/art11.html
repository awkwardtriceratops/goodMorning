By Charlie Warzel Opinion Writer at Large If you’ve never experienced a fire season before, it’s hard to explain the emotional, physical and sensory effects of having the world immolate before your eyes. I spent decades with only a passing knowledge of wildfires. I’d read about smoke jumpers and fire seasons, sure. I’d seen the news videos of planes and helicopters dumping water on burning hillsides. I have distinct memories of images of the California countryside at night with a raging fire threatening a neighborhood development and reports of evacuations and deaths. It seemed awful and cruel and arbitrary — but also like something happening in a distant part of the world. I empathized, but I didn’t understand. Then I moved West. I arrived in my new home in Montana in 2017 only 10 days before a July thunderstorm tore through the Bitterroot Valley and ignited a fire that burned for two months and devastated 53,902 acres of land 20 miles from my home. If you’re lucky, it comes on slowly. You awake one morning and you notice the smell. For me, it was the distinct smell of a campfire having just been extinguished. It’s an uncanny sensation that doesn’t fade. The air is hazy; the blue sky fades to a cloudy white in the direction of the fire. Before long, the smell and the haze increase. For me, a dull headache begins alongside a tickle in the back of my throat, similar to the way I feel when spring allergies begin. If the fire isn’t contained, every hour gets worse from there, and the world takes on an apocalyptic quality. That first Montana summer, I remember sitting in the bleachers of Missoula’s minor league baseball stadium. At the beer stand, I gazed out across the valley and to see an unmoving column of smoke shaped like the funnel of a tornado thousands of feet high. Its plume widened until it mingled with the clouds above, forming an oppressive ashy dome over my town. Behind it the sun set, drawing out otherworldly reds and yellows. It felt like living on an uninhabitable planet. They never told me that the sunsets at the end of the world would be so striking. Then even those colors fade. You wake up in darkness and you’re left with soot — in the sky, on your car, your windows, your driveway, your trees, your lawn. Eventually, those allergy feelings turn into a deeper malaise, which is fed by the sepia skies that resemble nuclear winter. Leaving the house feels both pointless and dangerous. My first fire season, I was stopped during a run by a police officer who told me to go home immediately. It simply wasn’t safe to be breathing the air outside, he told me. This is what happens if you’re one of the lucky ones who are affected only by the byproduct of those raging fires. I consider myself fortunate to have never seen one from less than a dozen or so miles away. But for those who encounter them — or have to live in their proximity, and grapple with the long-term health ramifications — it is hell on earth.
