By Alan Yuhas More Americans than ever before can vote by mail this year, as states prepare to hold an election under the conditions of a pandemic. But President Trump’s false claims about the risks of mail voting, problems at the Postal Service and the sheer variety of rules around mail voting — many of them changed because of the global health crisis — have created confusion about the systems. But despite Mr. Trump’s claims about the dangers of mail voting, the practice has been a part of American elections for over a century, and experts say his allegations of widespread fraud are unfounded. It depends on the state. But for many voters and election officials, the terms have become interchangeable. “I’m not sure there is a universally held distinction,” said John C. Fortier, the director of the Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C. Some states have made voting by mail available to all registered voters; others make it widely available; and some require voters to meet specific criteria, like being sick or serving in the military. “The biggest distinction is that absentee was meant to be for people who really needed it,” Mr. Fortier said. The term absentee was used for most of the 20th century, but as mail voting became more widely available in its last few decades, other terms emerged. This year, a record 76 percent of American voters will be eligible to receive a ballot in the mail for the 2020 election. Every state allows some voting by mail, but some require a specified reason or make the ballot available only at a voter’s request. As of Aug. 17, seven states, including Texas, New York and South Carolina, require an explained excuse for absentee voting. Thirty-four states, including Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio, allow absentee voting for all residents citing the coronavirus or without specifying a reason. (Mr. Trump has requested a mail-in ballot from Florida for this year’s presidential election.) And Washington, D.C., and nine states, including Utah, California and Nevada, mail ballots directly to voters. Read more about those breakdowns here. Election officials in many states, concerned about the potential for transmission of the coronavirus at polling places, have made temporary changes to their rules so that more people can vote by mail. Rules also vary between states about whether a ballot must be received by Election Day, or only postmarked by then. And some states will let voters drop off their ballots at secure drop boxes — though the Republican National Committee has contested Pennsylvania’s plan to do that in court. Election officials vet mail ballots with a series of checks. Voter registration information shows whether a person is registered elsewhere in the state, and identifying details like a birth date and Social Security number to help confirm that someone is a real person. Almost every state requires voters to sign the ballot’s return envelope, and election workers crosscheck that signature in the voter registration system. Washington State has mostly been a vote-by-mail state since 2005. There, ballots are also tied to specific individuals, with unique bar codes that let voters track their ballot after it was mailed — like a package heading to its destination. (Safeguards like the bar code also make it difficult for anyone to print fraudulent ballots without detection.)
