By Jill Waldbieser My ex and I aren’t friends — amicable might be pushing it — but in the four years since we split, we have navigated new homes, new partners and our 6-year-old son entering the public school system with minimal drama. When the pandemic hit and schools shut down, I almost felt guilty about my ability to ship my kid off to his father’s for five-day stretches while married friends lost sleep and fought with their husbands about whose turn it was to supervise virtual geometry. Then, in late August, I got word that my son’s school district would be opening special education classrooms early. My son, who is deaf and on the autism spectrum, would have the chance to go back to school, with his real teacher, in a real classroom, with his peers, for six hours a day. I’ve never won a lottery but at that moment I knew what it felt like. I was soon deflated to learn my ex didn’t share my enthusiasm. He pointed to the health risk, not only to our kid but also to my former in-laws, who helped him with child care. For that reason, my ex hadn’t missed a day of work since the pandemic began, nor endured the great pleasure of trying to teach a kindergartner who wouldn’t sit still for more than a few minutes at a time how to read via Zoom. We spent precious days going back and forth with the school start date looming, it became clear neither of us was going to budge. “What happens if we can’t agree?” he asked. What indeed. Our dilemma wasn’t unique. The pandemic and sudden shutdown had effectively stranded parents who were divorced or separated without their usual resource: the legal system. “In mid-March, courts closed and there was no access to anything by anyone for some time,” said Michael A. Mosberg, who practices family law in Manhattan. Barring a life-or-death emergency order, there was no judge, no mediator, no referee. This was, for many co-parents, effectively like sticking two quarreling kids in a room and telling them to work it out themselves. Parents like me had to rely on open and constant communication with their former partners — you know, the thing that worked so well when we were married. Only a few states, including Texas, even released statements instructing parents to continue to follow their court-issued custody orders. This lack of clear legal guidance opened the door for some parents to exercise what the law refers to as “self-help” — essentially taking matters into their own hands — according to Meredith Johnson Harbach, a professor of family law at the University of Richmond School of Law in Virginia.
