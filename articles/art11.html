Here’s how. By Michelle Hainer One recent morning, as I was passing through my dining room, I overheard my son’s fourth-grade teacher ask him to explain, via video chat, how he’d arrived at an answer to a math problem. “Because I’ve been in school for, like, four years,” he replied, as I cringed off-camera. When the lesson was over, I sat my son down to explain why his response wasn’t appropriate, and emailed his teacher to apologize on behalf of my budding comedian. Before the coronavirus came into our collective lives, I was largely unaware of what my kids and their teachers did in school all day — and vice versa. But now, those boundaries have become a thing of our pre-pandemic past. My son and 6-year-old daughter’s teachers know what every room on the first floor of my house looks like, and that my parenting style sometimes involves yelling. And I know what phrases their teachers use to get their attention (“1, 2, 3, eyes on me!”); and that sometimes my kids can’t find a pencil even though the box is sitting right in front of them. “Our homes used to be our sanctuaries, a place where we didn’t have to be on,” said Elza McKenna, a stay-at-home mother of four in Memphis, who said that she feels like her kids view her as an intern of sorts, spending her days searching for tape dispensers and refilling staplers on command. “And now we’re literally on all the time.” Dylann Gold, a clinical assistant professor in the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital at N.Y.U. Langone, said that the pandemic has dissolved social boundaries. “In ordinary life, we have school, home and work, and now all of these things are one location,” Dr. Gold said, which can make it difficult for kids to switch over to school mode when they’re sitting in the same space they typically use to play board games. It might explain why I hear “Mom, can you help me?” almost every morning. “When kids go to school, they have to ask the teacher for help, which means putting themselves out there and being vulnerable,” Dr. Gold said. “But when parents are there, it’s always going to feel more comfy to ask Mom or Dad.” My daughter, who returned to in-person class this week, had been surprisingly self-sufficient at logging on and following along with her first-grade lessons online. But I’d still catch her leaving her workstation to grab a drink, or a snack, or a hair accessory whenever she felt like it. “If you were in school, you wouldn’t be eating right now,” became my new catchphrase. Back in September, I overheard my son’s teacher lecturing her students about how they need to treat remote learning like a real school day — which doesn’t include a pit stop at the refrigerator while she’s in the middle of explaining the concept of place value. To establish more boundaries and to keep your kids focused during the day, Dr. Gold advised creating a visual schedule — with picture cues for younger kids and task lists for older ones — that clearly lays out all of the things they need to do before, during and after the school day. Collaborating on this task with your children can help keep them on track too, said Madeline Levine, a psychologist and author of “Ready or Not: Preparing Our Kids to Thrive in an Uncertain and Rapidly Changing World.” “Kids tend to do better when they have a hand in planning their day.” Their daily schedule should also include periods of “free” time for activities they enjoy, like riding a bike or playing a video game, Dr. Gold said, which will help keep them focused when they’re supposed to be learning. Scheduling play time with your kids also ensures that you get quality time with them, which is “more important than ever,” Dr. Gold said, now that so much of your day involves being an academic taskmaster. “Parents are spending a greater portion of their day ‘in charge,’” she said, adding that even a 5-minute-per-day period of uninterrupted play time with your child can be beneficial. Your relationship with your child shouldn’t be compromised by your new role as their educator, but if it’s starting to feel that way, it doesn’t hurt to call for backup, Dr. Gold advised. “Are there friends or family members who can support me in helping my kid learn this year?” That’s what two neighbors in Savage, Minn., did. When their third-grade boys’ school opted for a hybrid learning model in the fall, Julie Slowinske and Abby Phillips decided to take turns supervising each others’ kids during two remote learning mornings each week. “Before, getting my son to focus on reading, writing and math was excruciating, which led to a lot of nagging and yelling at him,” Slowinske said. “Now, when Abby asks him to do an assignment, he just does it. And he does it better because he wants to impress her.” According to Dr. Levine, remote learning — and its intrusion into the hours that were once spent away from your kids — can give parents and kids an opportunity to learn more about each other, “which leads to greater intimacy and connection,” she said. Kids can get a better sense of how hard their parents work, which Dr. Levine said is a great lesson in how much effort it takes to be successful, and they can see how parents navigate stressful situations. (Meeting my work deadlines while simultaneously explaining Common Core math comes to mind.) If the piling of responsibilities is adding a lot of stress, Dr. Gold said that it can be helpful for parents to manage their expectations. “I think anybody who tries to uphold the same standard that they do during non-pandemic life is probably going to fast-track to burnout,” she said, adding that it’s OK to abandon your normal routine of checking your child’s homework every night in favor of the myriad other items now on your to-do list. “Parents need to be realistic and forgiving with themselves.” With this in mind, I’ve stopped focusing on my failings and am trying to play to my strengths. Last month, my son’s class began learning how to structure and write stories, and his teacher asked me to be their guest speaker. I told the class about how I come up with ideas, and I answered their questions about being a writer. “Nice job, Mommy,” my son said to me when we logged off. I basked in his praise, feeling accomplished, for a moment. And then it was time to tackle science.
