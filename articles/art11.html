By Greg Bensinger Mr. Bensinger is a member of the editorial board. The Justice Department took a big swing at Google this week, alleging in a lawsuit that it violated antitrust law by stifling competition, particularly with its search engine and lucrative advertising business. It’s a compelling case, positioning Google as an anticompetitive behemoth that suppresses would-be rivals through exclusive deals and runs up prices for marketers through its byzantine online advertising sales process. Consumers, the Justice Department contends, are suffering from a lack of choice when they search for travel deals, local restaurants and answers to everyday questions. It would be great to see competitors like DuckDuckGo given a fighting chance to challenge Google’s clear market dominance, but the case here is both too narrow and too long coming to dethrone the company. The Justice Department appears to have rushed the suit in a quixotic attempt to make it an Election Day issue, and it is outgunned by Google’s legion of attorneys and mountain of cash.

There’s no question about Google’s dominance: It commands as much as 90 percent of the search market, and nearly 75 percent of mobile phones use its Android software.
