By Sopan Deb and Marc Stein RIGHT NOW Miami cuts the Lakers’ lead to 21 early in the fourth quarter. The Miami Heat are in another must-win game tonight, with the Los Angeles Lakers still just one victory from claiming the franchise’s 17th championship. Behind Jimmy Butler’s second triple-double of the N.B.A. finals, the Heat forced a Game 6 against the Lakers, who were seconds away from victory on Friday. Now the Lakers will turn again to LeBron James, who is seeking his fourth tittle, and Anthony Davis, who is after his first. Click here to refresh for live updates. Filing this under: “So you’re saying there’s a chance.” Bam Adebayo just hit a jumper to cut the Laker lead to 21, 90-69 with 8:37 left. The Heat opened the quarter on an 11-3 run. Against the Celtics in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals, the Heat cut a 20-point lead to 5 in the span of six minutes late in the game. We’re just saying. The Miami Heat ended the third quarter essentially on life support, as the Lakers entered the final frame with a 87-58 lead. Rajon Rondo continued his hot shooting from outside, hitting multiple 3-pointers. LeBron James (19 points, 11 rebounds, 9 assists) entered the fourth just one assist shy of yet another playoff triple-double. The Lakers are getting lots of help from players outside of James and Anthony Davis. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope has 17 points and Rondo added 19 points off the bench. The lone bright spot for the Heat has been Bam Adebayo, who has 15 points and 7 rebounds on only 10 shots. The Heat have played the Lakers virtually to a draw halfway through the third quarter. Which would be fine, except that Los Angeles entered the second half with a 28-point lead. Miami is  shooting a dismal 34 percent from the floor and has just one more assist (12) than turnovers (11). Jimmy Butler looks tired or, rather, like a mere mortal with 8 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists. By Jonathan Abrams When he was on the verge of reaching the 2020 N.B.A. finals, LeBron James offered praise to some of his Los Angeles Lakers teammates who helped bring the team to championship contention. Rajon Rondo, the backup point guard, capably conducted the team’s offense, James said. Center Dwight Howard provided an interior prowess, he added. “Dwight was a beast,” James said after the Lakers pinned the Denver Nuggets down, three games to one, in the Western Conference finals. “Dwight brought that physical presence. It was great for our ball club.” James, facing the Miami Heat in his 10th N.B.A. finals, is on the cusp of capturing a fourth championship. A knock against him, if there is one to make in his transcendent career, is that he has not won more championships, despite being in a position to do so in almost every year of the 2010s. He doesn’t have to look further than inside his own locker room to spot the roadblocks who stifled his earlier championship efforts with the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Miami Heat. Howard and Rondo played vital roles in prematurely ending his postseasons in the Eastern Conference. They join the other current Lakers Danny Green, JaVale McGee and Quinn Cook as those who firmly and successfully opposed James in years past.
