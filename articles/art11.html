By Jeremy W. Peters and Isabella Grullón Paz Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by eight points in Michigan, a battleground state that Mr. Trump flipped in 2016. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of 856 likely voters in Michigan from Oct. 23 to Oct. 26. Joseph R. Biden Jr. is leading President Trump by eight percentage points in Michigan, according to a new poll from The New York Times and Siena College on Wednesday, the latest survey to show Mr. Trump’s troubled standing in Midwestern battleground states as white voters without college degrees, his political bulwark, turn away from him. Four years ago, Michigan provided one of Mr. Trump’s most surprising victories and helped him barrel through the so-called blue wall of Northern industrial states that had favored Democrats in presidential elections since the 1990s. This year, Michigan is trending with those states again, but in the wrong direction for Mr. Trump’s hopes of re-election.
