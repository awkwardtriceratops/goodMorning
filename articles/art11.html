Buoying Artists and Educators<br></h1><p id="artcont">THE NEEDIEST CASES FUND An initiative provides cultural programming to the city’s 1,800 public schools and supports arts organizations in the process. By Sara Aridi When the coronavirus pandemic brought New York City to a standstill, New York Community Trust, a foundation that supports local nonprofits, had many concerns. Among them was that an aggressive response to the virus would spell a blow to the economy — and also to public schools, which had a record $447 million investment in arts education for the 2018-19 school year. When the city announced its 2021 budget in April, cuts included a $15.5 million reduction for the Education Department’s planned $23 million to expand arts education. To help fill that gap, Leigh Ross, a program officer at New York Community Trust, reached out to a team at the department’s Office of Arts and Special Projects. Together, they outlined a plan to provide free and remote arts programming to New York City’s 1,800 public schools — the country’s largest school system. “We created the project to respond to what we saw as an emergency in arts education,” Ms. Ross said. “But I think it’s turned into something that could be used and could be benefiting kids for years to come.” Donate now to the 109th annual campaign of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. All proceeds go to 10 organizations providing assistance to those facing economic hardship. Make a tax-deductible donation through GoFundMe. New York Community Trust, one of 10 organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, allocated a $680,000 grant to the project, most of which is funding four artistic nonprofits that are crafting curriculums under specific disciplines: Carnegie Hall for music, 92nd Street Y for dance, Roundabout Theater Company for theater and Studio in a School for fine arts.
