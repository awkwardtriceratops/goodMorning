By Jenni Russell Ms. Russell is a contributing writer. America, we’ve been here before you. We know what it is like to have a country’s leader downplay the virus, ignore safety measures inside their work space, assume health restrictions are for the little people, and then become ill. We know what it’s like to be pitched into fearful political uncertainties; who’s making the decisions in a crisis, and what are the consequences for us if a leader is incapacitated? President Trump could have drawn some lessons in caution from Boris Johnson’s hospitalization this spring. Instead we have history repeating itself, on a short-circuiting loop, but in both these cases, far too grimly to be described as farce. Just like Mr. Trump, a complacent Mr. Johnson failed to treat the virus with the seriousness it required from the start. As the virus was spreading across the world in February, with scientists desperately warning of its dangers, and Italy already in a state of emergency, Mr. Johnson did virtually nothing. His government’s crisis committee met several times to discuss the threat, but he didn’t bother turning up. Instead he disappeared from public view for at least 10 days, much of it on holiday with his pregnant girlfriend.
