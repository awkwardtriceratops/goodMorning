The eggs were not ovals but prisms, brown paper lanterns scarcely bigger than chia seeds. They were laid by a wild-caught female Phyllium asekiense, a leaf insect from Papua New Guinea belonging to a group called frondosum, which was known only from female specimens. Phyllium asekiense is a stunning leaf insect, occurring both in summery greens and autumnal browns. As Royce Cumming, a graduate student at the City University of New York, puts it, “Dead leaf, live leaf, semi-dried leaf.” Mr. Le Tirant, the collections manager of the insectarium since 1989, specializes in scarab beetles; he estimates that he has 25,000 beetles in his private collection at home. But he had always harbored a passion for leaf insects and had successfully bred two species, a small one from the Philippines and a larger one from Malaysia. A Phyllium asekiense — rare, beautiful and, most important, living — would be a treasure in any insectarium. In the insect-rearing laboratory, Mario Bonneau and other technicians nestled the 13 eggs on a mesh screen on a bed of coconut fibers and spritzed them often with water. In the fall, and over the course of several months, five eggs hatched into spindly black nymphs. The technicians treated the baby nymphs with utmost care, moving them from one tree to another without touching the insects, only whatever leaf they clung to. “Other insects, we just grab them,” Mr. Le Tirant said. “But these small leaf insects were so precious, like jewels in our laboratory.” The technicians offered the nymphs a buffet of fragrant guava, bramble and salal leaves. Two nymphs refused to eat and soon died. The remaining three munched on bramble, molted, munched, molted, and molted some more. One nymph grew green and broad, just like her mother. But to Mr. Le Tirant’s befuddlement, the other two grew slender and sticklike and even sprouted a pair of wings. They bore a curious resemblance to leaf insects in Nanophyllium, an entirely different genus whose six species had been described only from male specimens. Mr. Le Tirant emailed a picture to Mr. Cumming, who confirmed what had now become obvious: The two species in fact were one and the same. The hatchlings had solved a century-old mystery of the missing Nanophyllium female. “Since 1906, we’ve only ever found males,” Mr. Cumming said. “And now we have our final, solid proof.” Mr. Cumming and Mr. Le Tirant recently united the long-lost mates — broad-leafed females and slender males — in one species, Nanophyllium asekiense, in the journal ZooKeys. It is actually quite common for leaf insects — which are a family in the broader order of stick insects — to be known from just one sex. Many stick insects display extreme sexual dimorphism, with females unrecognizable from their male companions. In 2018, Paul Brock, a scientific associate at the Natural History Museum in London who edited a rough draft of the new paper, solved a similar mystery in stick insects. He and his colleagues described the first male Acanthoxyla, a genus of stick insect from New Zealand that was thought to be exclusively female, from a specimen found on a car in Cornwall, England.
