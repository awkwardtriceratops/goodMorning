Joe Biden should stick to “no names.” By Martin J. Siegel Mr. Siegel is a former Senate Judiciary Committee staff member. What does it mean that we now practically elect our Supreme Court justices? True, they’re supposed to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, not elected, but that’s becoming a quaint anachronism like other parts of the Constitution — the emoluments clause, say, or the idea that laws come from votes in Congress rather than executive orders. In 2016, Donald Trump didn’t simply promise to name conservative justices, he became the first presidential candidate to release a list of actual people, lower court judges, he’d nominate for the Supreme Court. When conservatives pulled the lever for Mr. Trump that year, they knew they were also electing one or more of these judges to fill Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat. The list, which included Neil Gorsuch, is widely credited with helping Mr. Trump win the White House. Now President Trump is at it again: He named 20 new conservatives he’d consider for the court in a second term. “Candidates for president owe the American people a specific list of the individuals,” he claimed, so people can “properly make a decision as to how they will vote.” Some liberal groups have urged Joe Biden to release his own list. During the Democratic primaries, he said he would offer “no names.” But he did commit to appointing a Black woman. All but one of the justices named since 1975 have been lower court judges, and there are (regrettably) only 10 Black women on federal and state supreme courts younger than 55 and appointed by Democrats. So Mr. Biden and his voters more or less have a list, too. Putting the names of actual, would-be justices on the quadrennial ballot goes far beyond general critiques of the court in past elections or even promising to choose from a certain demographic. The more lists of potential nominees become the norm, which seems likely given their political potency, the more they’ll threaten to distort how we see the judiciary and how it actually behaves. Some Republicans view a list as a way to squash the judicial independence still exhibited by Justice Gorsuch (who wrote the decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which banned job discrimination against gay employees) and Chief Justice John Roberts (who sided with liberal justices on the DACA decision). They want a guarantee for hard-line conservatives against future betrayal.
