The video statement, created as part of a Time magazine feature that aired on ABC on Tuesday evening, was hardly partisan by the era’s fire-and-brimstone standards. The couple, known formally as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, did not endorse any candidates, and much of the focus was on building compassion and better discussions. But Meghan, a U.S. citizen who has said she plans to vote in November’s presidential election, made clear she believed the stakes were high this year. “Every four years, we are told the same thing: that this is the most important election of our lifetime,” she said. “But this one is. When we vote, our values are put into action, and our voices are heard. Your voice is a reminder that you matter, because you do, and you deserve to be heard.” Prince Harry added, “As we approach this November, it's vital that we reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity.”
