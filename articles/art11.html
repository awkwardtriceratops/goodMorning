A Bronx man was charged in connection with the derailment, officials said. By Christina Morales Three people sustained minor injuries Sunday morning after a northbound A train struck an object thrown on the tracks and derailed, the authorities said. One passenger was transported to a hospital and two others were evaluated and declined to be transported, the Fire Department said. About 135 people were on the train. Sarah E. Feinberg, the interim president of New York City Transit, said the train “came into contact with debris on the roadbed” around 8:15 a.m. as it was pulling into the 14th Street station, causing a wheel to leave the track. That caused a loss of power to all four tracks, and a northbound A train near 34th Street remained in a tunnel, she said. About 125 people aboard that train were safely removed after officials brought in another train and placed an emergency bridge for passengers to walk on. On Sunday evening, the police said a 30-year-old Bronx man had been charged in connection with the derailment. The man, Demetrius Harvard, was charged with reckless endangerment, criminal mischief, assault and criminal trespass, the police said. The man “was seen throwing debris on the tracks,” Terence A. Monahan, the Police Department’s chief of department, wrote on Twitter. Officials said the debris had caused the first subway car to derail while entering the station. There was extensive damage to the subway car, the track and four structural steel columns, transit officials said at a news conference on Sunday afternoon. Frank Jezycki, the acting senior vice president for subways, declined to comment on specifics about the debris, but said it would have been significant. “We aim for a normal rush hour for tomorrow morning,” he said. “That is the goal. However, we do have a significant amount of work ahead of us, which can only commence once the police investigation concludes.” Azi Paybarah and Ashley Southall contributed reporting. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
