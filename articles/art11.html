269 pp. Riverhead. $27. Evans’s latest story collection reflects on recent mythologies surrounding American race relations. In “Happily Ever After,” a Black woman working at a Titanic-themed hotel must make herself scarce during birthday parties (“We’d hate for the 6-year-old having tea parties on the Titanic to get the wrong idea about history,” says her boss). In “Boys Go to Jupiter,” a white college student turns into a poster girl for American historical amnesia when a photo of her in a Confederate-flag bikini goes viral.
