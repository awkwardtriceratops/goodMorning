But key players are not on board. By Tariq Panja Taken together, the proposals amount to the biggest changes in English soccer in more than a quarter of a century. An 18-team Premier League. Hundreds of millions of dollars in extra payments from Premier League clubs to their poorer rivals. And an end of direct payment to clubs relegated from the top division. The reform plan — the brainchild of the American owners of England’s two biggest and most successful clubs, Manchester United and Liverpool — would remake the structure that governs English soccer’s four professional leagues and replace it with what those behind the idea have pitched as a more sustainable model. The biggest changes would be that the Premier League shrink to 18 teams from its current 20, perhaps as soon as 2022, and transfer critical decision-making power in the league from the consensus-driven model that has been at its core for three decades to one in which a handful of the richest teams get a bigger say. The details were first reported by The Daily Telegraph and later confirmed by the English Football League, the organization that represents the 72 clubs below the Premier League. Liverpool and Manchester United did not respond to requests for comment. But Rick Parry, the chairman of the E.F.L., who had been involved in the talks, gave a full-throated endorsement to the proposals. Although senior officials from Liverpool and Manchester United had discussed ideas in secret for several years before putting together a tentative proposal, other leading clubs and the Premier League were brought into the talks only recently. Some executives and administrators learned about them only late last week, and others found out on Sunday after reports in the news media. The Premier League reacted with frustration on Sunday, saying in a statement that the talks should have been carried out in a more open and inclusive manner, even as it said it supported “a wide-ranging discussion on the future of the game, including its competition structures, calendar and overall financing.” Still, it said, “in the Premier League’s view, a number of the individual proposals in the plan published today could have a damaging impact on the whole game and we are disappointed to see that Rick Parry, chair of the E.F.L., has given his on-the-record support.” The British government also expressed its displeasure, accusing the clubs behind the plan of cooking up “back room deals” that would, according to a spokesman for the department responsible for sports, “create a closed shop at the very top of the game.”
