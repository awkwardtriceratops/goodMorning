By Tariq Panja LONDON — After the unmasking of its state-orchestrated doping program  turned it into a sporting pariah, Russia hardly quietly accepted its punishment. Angered and humiliated, it has fought, so far unsuccessfully, to re-enter the international sports community through legal channels. But, American prosecutors and British government officials say, it went much further than that, actively seeking to undermine the Olympics it was barred from. Just as it used the full might of the state in a cheating scheme that brought it now-disputed medals at events like the 2014 Sochi Games, Russia unleashed some of the same forces to hack and disrupt the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea and the now-delayed 2020 Tokyo Summer Games, according to American and British officials. Now, once again, the International Olympic Committee is left to decide what, if any, action to take against one of the largest and most influential countries in its movement, one that has time and again challenged its ideals. According to the American and British authorities, operatives from Russia’s military intelligence wing unleashed a barrage of cyberattacks on the 2018 Winter Olympics and started operations against the Tokyo Games as part of a broader worldwide hacking campaign that also included attacks on a French presidential election and Ukraine’s electricity grid. Russia denied the allegations, as it did when details of its doping program first emerged, and after attacks on other sporting bodies, including the global doping regulator. A Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, on Tuesday described the accusations as “Russophobia.”
