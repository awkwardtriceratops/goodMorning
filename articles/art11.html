By Erwin Chemerinsky Mr. Chemerinsky is dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley. President Trump and his Republican followers believe they can ensure victory in November by limiting the number of people who can vote. What’s worse, in recent decisions, Republican-appointed judges seem to have fallen in step with this strategy, more inclined to advance the party’s interests than uphold the Constitution. Two troubling decisions by federal appeals courts this month limited the rights of certain people to vote, even though the Supreme Court has long held that voting is a fundamental right under the Constitution. One of those decisions would restrict access to absentee ballots in Texas, an especially troubling turn as the country grapples with a pandemic that has claimed more than 200,000 lives and shows no signs of abating. The other would prohibit ex-felons in Florida from voting unless they pay any fines or court fees they owe. As many as 774,000 people could be barred from the polls as a result. In the Texas decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed a lower-court order requiring Texas to expand the availability of absentee ballots. Anyone who is at least 65 can vote by mail in Texas, but younger people can do so only under limited circumstances, like being disabled or absent from their home county. The lower-court judge, Fred Biery, appointed by President Bill Clinton, ruled that anyone in Texas should be able to vote by mail, especially in light of the pandemic. Would-be voters should not have to choose between voting and risking exposure to the coronavirus by standing in line to vote, the judge said. He asserted that the Texas law violates the 26th Amendment’s prohibition against denying or abridging the voting rights of anyone 18 or older on the basis of their age. But in an opinion by Judge Leslie Southwick, who was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, the court found no violation of the 26th Amendment. “This claim fails because adding a benefit to another class of voters does not deny or abridge the plaintiffs’ 26th Amendment right to vote,” Judge Southwick wrote. Of his two Democratic colleagues, one concurred; the other dissented on the merits. Voters should not have to risk becoming infected by the coronavirus at their polling places. It is impossible to understand what interest Texas has in restricting voting by mail other than the Republican hope of depressing turnout. In the Florida decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld a state law requiring that ex-felons pay all of their outstanding fines and fees in order to vote. In 2018, Florida voters passed an initiative, Amendment 4, which provided that “any disqualification from voting arising from a felony conviction shall terminate and voting rights shall be restored upon completion of all terms of sentence including parole or probation.” The Republican-controlled Legislature then passed a law that barred ex-felons from voting unless they paid all money owed to the state, such as fees for court costs, and any fines. Judge Robert Hinkle of the Federal District Court, another Clinton appointee, concluded that this was an unconstitutional “pay-to-vote system.” Over a half-century ago, the Supreme Court held that the government cannot condition the right to vote on people having to pay even a dollar.
