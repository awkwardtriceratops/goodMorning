Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Wednesday. We’re off tomorrow and Friday for Thanksgiving, but we’ll be back on Monday. Weather: Clouds give way to sun; high in the mid-50s. It’s a rainy Thanksgiving Day, but the rest of the long weekend will see at least some sun and be in the 50s. Alternate-side parking: In effect today. Suspended on Thanksgiving Day. A somewhat reluctant trailblazer. A leader at a difficult period of fiscal crisis and racial tension. A mentor who inspired other leaders. Those were some of the ways that prominent New Yorkers remembered David N. Dinkins, the first (and so far only) Black mayor of New York City, after he died on Monday night. Many said his short time in office had a lasting influence. “He simply put us on a better path,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Tuesday. “And he did it with heart and warmth and love.” [Read more about how political leaders remembered Mr. Dinkins.] Mr. Dinkins was born in Trenton, N.J., and briefly moved to Harlem with his mother and sister while in first grade. He would return to the neighborhood with his wife, Joyce B. Dinkins, who died in October. He would later attend Brooklyn Law School, serve in the State Assembly and as city clerk, and become one of the first Black lawmakers to join the inner circle of Tammany Hall.
