Biden’s expected picks for his economic team showcase a commitment to diversity. Gavin Newsom has to pick someone to fill Kamala Harris’s Senate seat, and the pressure is mounting. Biden names all-female communications team with Jen Psaki as press secretary. Biden’s doctor says president-elect has hairline fracture after twisting his ankle playing with dog. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is expected to officially name top members of his economic team this week, according to people familiar with the matter, showcasing his commitment to diversity and placing several women in top economic roles. With the picks, Mr. Biden is sending a clear message that economic policymaking in his administration will be shaped by liberal thinkers with a strong focus on worker empowerment as a tool for economic growth. They include: Cecilia Rouse, a Princeton labor economist, to run the Council of Economic Advisers, who would be the first Black woman to lead the council. A labor economist, she worked on Mr. Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers for two years and at the White House’s National Economic Council during the Clinton administration. Neera Tanden, the chief executive of the Center for American Progress, to lead the Office of Management and Budget She would be the first Indian-American to lead the Office of Management and Budget. Janet L. Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chair, as Treasury secretary. Her expected role was widely reported last week. Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey will be named to the Council of Economic Advisers, which is a three-member team that advises the president on economic policy. They both come from a liberal, labor-oriented school of economics that views rising inequality as a threat to the economy and emphasizes government efforts to support and empower workers. Mr. Bernstein was Mr. Biden’s first chief economist when he was vice president. Ms. Boushey was a top policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton in 2016. Adewale Adeyemo, a senior international economic adviser in the Obama administration, is expected to be named deputy Treasury secretary. An immigrant from Nigeria, he has extensive experience working at the Treasury Department during the Obama administration, when he was a senior adviser and deputy chief of staff. Brian Deese, a former Obama economic aide who helped lead that administration’s efforts to bail out the American automotive industry, has also been selected to lead the National Economic Council, according to three people with knowledge of the selection. Mr. Deese is a veteran of economic policymaking, having served as the acting head of the Office of Management and Budget and the deputy director of the Economic Council under Mr. Obama, as well as a special adviser on climate change. The appointments could fall short of hopes within the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, which has been frustrated that their views are not being sufficiently represented in early personnel decisions. In particular, the decision to select Ms. Tanden, a divisive and partisan figure in the party, could culminate in an intraparty fight, as well as a confirmation battle. Republicans, who are expected to retain control of the Senate, are unlikely to easily pass Ms. Tanden, who advised Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and has been one of the most outspoken critics of President Trump. Mr. Biden’s other picks are expected to be less contentious. — Alan Rappeport, Jim Tankersley, Michael D. Shear and Jeanna Smialek Planning for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s inauguration is intensifying, with his team announcing on Monday the formation of a Presidential Inaugural Committee that will be carefully attuned to the challenge of managing inauguration activities amid a pandemic. The organization rolled out the names of senior leaders of the committee, as well as a website for the team, on Monday morning. The committee is expected to work with the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, the announcement said. The committee will be helmed by Tony Allen, the president of Delaware State University, an historically Black school in Mr. Biden’s home state. “This year’s inauguration will look different amid the pandemic, but we will honor the American inaugural traditions and engage Americans across the country while keeping everybody healthy and safe,” Mr. Allen said in a statement. Maju Varghese, the chief operating officer on the Biden campaign, will serve as executive director. State Senator Yvanna Cancela, Democrat of Nevada and an early Biden supporter, and Erin Wilson, who was Mr. Biden’s political director during the campaign, have been named as deputy executive directors, according to a release from the organization. — Katie Glueck Alex Padilla, California’s secretary of state, has emerged as the front-runner to succeed Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. But Gov. Gavin Newsom appears to be in no rush to make his choice. Though many names have been floated to succeed Ms. Harris, Mr. Padilla has emerged as the front-runner, according to more than a half-dozen advisers, political consultants and fellow lawmakers familiar with the governor’s thinking. Mr. Newsom faces extraordinary crosscurrents of factional rivalry and identity politics in a state where the Democratic Party is thoroughly defined by both. He has spoken about the Senate appointment not as a political bauble that he is eager to dispense, but as a burdensome task that is likelier to generate grudges than personal gratitude and popular excitement. Mr. Padilla, 47, has emerged as the favorite of Latino lawmakers, advocacy groups and a number of labor officials. But other Latino candidates also have supporters. Xavier Becerra, 62, California’s attorney general, has run and won statewide and has represented Los Angeles in Congress. And Mayor Robert Garcia, of Long Beach, 42, the city’s first openly gay mayor, has an enthusiastic base. Active campaigns are also underway to urge Mr. Newsom to replace Ms. Harris with a woman, particularly a Black woman. Led by longtime state Democrats like Willie Brown and groups of high-dollar female donors, they argue that when Ms. Harris assumes her new office, the Senate will once again have no Black female members. At least two Black women in California’s House delegation are pursuing the appointment: Representatives Barbara Lee, 74, and Karen Bass, 67. Some Democrats have also suggested that Mr. Newsom could appoint a distinguished figure in the late stages of their public life, who would serve out the remaining two years of Ms. Harris’s term without seeking re-election — someone like Dolores Huerta, the civil rights leader and labor organizer, who is 90. — Shawn Hubler and Alexander Burns President Trump on Monday lashed out at Georgia’s Republican governor, calling him “hapless” and suggesting on Twitter that he should pursue Mr. Trump’s baseless allegations about voter fraud in the state. In two tweets, Mr. Trump said that Gov. Brian Kemp should overrule Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, and order that ballot signatures be reviewed and the number of envelopes and ballots be compared. He said doing so would reveal rampant fraud, an assertion that has been rejected by the state’s Republican elections officials. Georgia has already completed an audit of the election in the state, recounting over five million ballots by hand that reaffirmed President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory there. Mr. Trump’s remarks on Twitter came a day after he said during an interview that the F.B.I. and the Justice Department might be “involved” in what he again groundlessly called a fraudulent presidential election, hinting that the nation’s law enforcement agencies were biased against his fading efforts to remain in office. No significant evidence has been found to support the president’s claims, and several judges in multiple states have quickly dismissed lawsuits by his legal team alleging fraud. “This is total fraud. And how the F.B.I. and Department of Justice — I don’t know, maybe they’re involved — but how people are allowed to get away with this stuff is unbelievable,” Mr. Trump said in a roughly 45-minute interview with the Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. It was his first one-on-one interview since his defeat by Mr. Biden. With several important federal deadlines coming up for the election process, including a Dec. 8 deadline for states to resolve all election disputes, Mr. Trump declined to say when his time fighting the results would be up. “I’m not going to say a date,” Mr. Trump said. During a “60 Minutes” interview that aired on Sunday night, Christopher Krebs, the former government official who had overseen cybersecurity efforts for the 2020 election and was fired in mid-November, reaffirmed his confidence in the integrity of the vote and called Mr. Trump’s unfounded allegations of voter fraud “farcical.” An increasing number of Republican lawmakers have begun to acknowledge Mr. Biden’s victory. But many, including the party’s leaders, still refuse to do so. — Michael Crowley, Catie Edmondson and Chris Cameron President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Sunday announced an all-female White House communications staff, with Jennifer Psaki, a veteran of the Obama administration, in the most visible role as White House press secretary. “Communicating directly and truthfully to the American people is one of the most important duties of a president,” Mr. Biden said in a statement, drawing an implicit contrast with the Trump administration’s use of the White House briefing room to disseminate falsehoods and try to undermine the credibility of the news media. The transition team also announced that Kate Bedingfield, 39, who served as a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, will serve as the White House communications director. Karine Jean Pierre, who previously served as the chief public affairs officer for MoveOn.org, will be the principal deputy press secretary. Pili Tobar, a former immigrant advocate with the group America’s Voice, will serve as the deputy White House communications director. Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to Mr. Biden on the campaign, will serve as the senior adviser and chief spokeswoman for Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Ashley Etienne, a former senior adviser to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, will serve as the communications director for Ms. Harris. “President-elect Biden has a history of advocating on behalf of women in the U.S. and around the world, and today’s announcement is a continuation of that work,” Ron Klain, the incoming chief of staff, said in a statement. Ms. Psaki, 41, previously served as the White House communications director for President Barack Obama and as the State Department spokeswoman under Secretary of State John Kerry. On Twitter, Ms. Psaki said she saw her job as trying to “rebuild trust of the American people” and she noted that many of the women on the team, including herself, were also mothers of young children. (Two of Mr. Trump’s press secretaries were also mothers of young children.) She said she planned to “think outside of the box” about how to use the podium to make the Biden-Harris agenda more accessible to the public. She did not say whether she planned to reinstate the daily press briefing. — Annie Karni President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. visited an orthopedic specialist in Newark, Del., on Sunday afternoon after he twisted his ankle playing with his one of his dogs over the holiday weekend, according to his office, an injury that his doctor said resulted in hairline fractures that would require him to wear a boot for several weeks. Although initial X-rays showed no obvious fracture, a “follow-up CT scan confirmed hairline (small) fractures of President-elect Biden’s lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones, which are in the midfoot,” Dr. Kevin O’Connor, the director of executive medicine at GW Medical Faculty Associates, said in a statement distributed by Mr. Biden’s office. Mr. Biden left the doctor’s office Sunday just before 6:30 p.m., after a visit that lasted just over two hours, and then went to an imaging center for a short time for the additional CT. A Biden spokesman said the president-elect had scheduled the follow-up on Sunday to avoid disrupting his schedule on Monday. Mr. Biden is already operating on a crunched transition time frame, after the head of the General Services Administration did not formally acknowledge the presidential election results for weeks after Election Day, temporarily depriving Mr. Biden of access to federal resources and preventing his advisers from beginning coordination with Trump administration officials. A van was maneuvered to block reporters and photographers from seeing Mr. Biden as he entered the doctor’s office. The dog Mr. Biden was playing with when he was injured is Major, a German shepherd the Bidens had fostered and then adopted in 2018. They have another German shepherd, Champ, and have announced plans to get a cat when they move into the White House next year, as well. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
