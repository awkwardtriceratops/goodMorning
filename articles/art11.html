By Emily Flitter and Michael J. de la Merced Wall Street’s longest-enduring glass ceiling is about to be broken. Citigroup, the country’s third-largest bank, said on Thursday that Jane Fraser will become its chief executive in February. She would be the first woman to lead a major financial institution in the United States. Ms. Fraser, the bank’s president and head of its global consumer banking business, will succeed Michael Corbat, who has served as chief executive since 2012. Ms. Fraser was teed up as the bank’s next leader last year, when she was promoted to her current role.
