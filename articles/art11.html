By Concepción de León Princeton University has agreed to pay nearly $1 million in back wages to female professors after a review found disparities in compensation between male and female professors, the U.S. Department of Labor said. The review, which started in 2014 and focused on the wages of female full professors from 2012 to 2014, found that 106 women had been paid less than their male counterparts, according to a statement last week from the Labor Department’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. The university did not admit any wrongdoing, but it agreed to an early resolution conciliation agreement with the federal compliance office on Sept. 30 to “avoid lengthy and costly litigation and its impact on the faculty and the university,” said Ben Chang, the university’s spokesman. Craig E. Leen, the director of the federal compliance office, said in the Labor Department statement that his agency was “satisfied” that Princeton had agreed to enter into the agreement and address the issues found in its report.
