By Michelle Goldberg Opinion Columnist After Donald Trump was elected, the first time I felt any hope was at the Women’s March. The second was when I went to Georgia to cover the 2017 special election to fill the House seat vacated by Tom Price, who’d just become Trump’s secretary of health and human services. Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District, an affluent area once represented by Newt Gingrich, was considered safely Republican, but Democrats saw a chance to use the special election to register their fury and disgust with the new president. They poured money and resources into the campaign of a first-time candidate, Jon Ossoff. When I arrived in the district, though, it wasn’t Ossoff who caught my attention. It was the legions of women who’d never been particularly political before, but who were shocked into activism by Trump’s victory. Many of them had previously put their energy into PTAs and homeowners associations. They had a deep, granular knowledge of their community that couldn’t be bought, and they were using it to find every one of their neighbors who might be open to voting Democratic. The story of that race, Ossoff told me then, was “about the women in this community, Democrats, independents and Republicans, who have picked this campaign up and carried it on their shoulders.” Neither candidate ended up winning a majority, and the race went to a runoff, which Ossoff lost by almost four points. But I followed several of the women I met as they redoubled their efforts, and in the 2018 midterms, they helped flip the seat to a Democrat, Lucy McBath. The Cook Political Report now rates her seat as “likely Democratic.” Similar shifts are happening all over America, as abhorrence toward Trump has sparked an explosion of organizing among women. However Tuesday turns out, this mobilization has rapidly altered Georgia’s politics, helping to turn a Republican redoubt into a competitive purple state. As I write this, FiveThirtyEight’s polling average shows Biden slightly favored to win Georgia. Ossoff is now a Senate candidate, running about even with the incumbent Republican, David Perdue. That race is expected to go to a runoff, as is the one that the Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, a Democrat, is waging for the state’s other Senate seat. Georgia’s Seventh District, where Carolyn Bourdeaux is running again after a narrow loss in 2018, is now rated by Cook as “lean Democratic.”
