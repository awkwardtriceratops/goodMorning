By Neil Irwin By many measures, the Federal Reserve’s efforts to rescue the economy this spring were a resounding success. The financial system is stable, the stock market is back to pre-pandemic levels, and creditworthy companies (especially larger ones) can borrow money on favorable terms. But as the central bank meets this week for its regular policy meeting, its leaders, including Chair Jerome Powell, face a paradox: The very success of the Fed’s efforts at boosting financial markets has lessened the sense of urgency on Capitol Hill to take corresponding steps to funnel money toward small businesses, unemployed workers and average Americans. It is creating a bizarre two-tiered economy. The number of workers filing new jobless claims each week remains higher than at its peak during the Great Recession, and hundreds of thousands of smaller businesses are at risk of failure — while many large companies experience record stock prices, and the portfolios of wealthy Americans are in great shape. The Fed’s tools work through the financial system. The central bank can stimulate the economy, but only through a sort of Rube Goldberg process: It buys securities on the open market, pushing up asset prices and lowering the cost of credit through the economy. That, in theory, leads businesses and consumers to spend and invest more. Those first-order effects — of pumping up financial markets — are quicker to take hold and easier to measure than the indirect effects on things like job creation and wages. Since March, the Fed has bought up Treasury bonds, mortgage-backed securities and corporate debt, using its bottomless capacity to create money from thin air, all of which have helped fuel a recovery in financial markets. Fiscal policymakers, by contrast, can direct money with greater precision, transferring cash directly to households and businesses that need it. And in the spring, with remarkable speed and bipartisanship, that’s what Congress and the Trump administration did. The result: direct $1,200 payments to Americans, expanded unemployment insurance benefits, and hundreds of billions of dollars directed to the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses.
