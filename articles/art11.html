By Lucy Tompkins, Maura Turcotte and Libby Seline GREAT FALLS, Mont. — For months, the jail in central Montana’s Cascade County was free of the coronavirus, which seemed as distant a threat as it did in much of the nation’s rural Mountain West. Then a few people who had the virus were arrested. By the time Paul Krogue, the jail’s medical director, realized there was a problem, nearly 50 inmates were infected in the jail, where some had been sleeping on mats on an overcrowded floor. After several weeks, Mr. Krogue got a call that infections were spreading to a side of the jail that had been virus-free. He hung up the phone and put his head in his hands. “I just kind of lost it, like, ‘My God, I don’t know how much longer I can do this,’” Mr. Krogue, a nurse practitioner, recalled. “I was just scared that I’m not going to be able to see it through, that I’m going to get sick — you just feel so exhausted and it’s just a lot.” The Mountain West, which for months avoided the worst of the pandemic, has rapidly devolved into one of the most alarming hot spots in a country that recorded its eight millionth confirmed case on Thursday, a day when more than 65,000 cases were announced nationwide, the most in a single day since July. Seventeen states, including many in the Mountain West, have added more cases in the past week than any other week of the pandemic. And the spread through sparsely populated areas of rural America has created problems in small towns that lack critical resources — including doctors — even in ordinary times. Wyoming, which did not have 1,000 total cases until June, recently added more than 1,000 in a single week. Reports of new infections have recently reached record levels in Alaska, Colorado and Idaho. And Montana, where more than half of the state’s cases have been announced since August, is averaging more than 500 cases per day. In Cascade County, more than 300 inmates and staff members have been infected in a facility meant to hold 365 people, the county’s first major outbreak in a region where the virus is suddenly surging. The county seat, Great Falls, is seeing its worst case numbers yet. The local hospital and its 27-bed Covid-19 unit is at capacity. The county health department is racing to hire new contact tracers. And Mr. Krogue, who also teaches nursing at Montana State University’s Great Falls campus, has seen attendance in his classes dwindle as students fall ill or quarantine.  One place where the infections have spread has been local jails, which are confined, often crowded spaces. Jails are staples of local communities and tend to have people coming and going more quickly than prisons. Jails can hold everyone from people awaiting criminal trials for months to those picked up for a suspended driver’s license for a few hours. With so many people filtering in and out, jails pose extra risks for the virus’s spread — not only inside facilities but in potentially feeding outbreaks in the rest of the community.
