By Johnny Diaz The New Yorker said Monday that it had suspended the staff writer Jeffrey Toobin after a Zoom call last week among employees of the magazine and WNYC radio in which he reportedly exposed himself. “I made an embarrassingly stupid mistake, believing I was off-camera,” Mr. Toobin said in a statement about a report on Monday by Vice. “I apologize to my wife, family, friends and co-workers.” “I thought I had muted the Zoom video,” he added. “I thought no one on the Zoom call could see me.” In a text message, he declined to elaborate.
