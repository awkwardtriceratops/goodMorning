By Roger Cohen Opinion Columnist SANTA MARGHERITA, Italy — In Italy there are seasons — and then there is the season. Summer comes, the country’s woes are set aside, and, to the eternal refrain of “tutti al mare” (“Everyone to the sea”), the exodus to the consoling coast begins. The national debt fades between sea and stars. This year is a little different. Masks dangle from ears in the new insouciant look or are tied around elbows then used for a bump-greeting. Beach chairs are (anti-) socially distanced. With stores operating two-at-a-time limits, the line for focaccia is so long that people read an entire newspaper (and Italians still read them) as they wait. Americans have almost vanished, as have the Russians. Children’s beach chatter revolves around the all-canceling virus, which gives a new edge to games of tag. The difference is the coronavirus, lurking like the knowledge that summer will end. Contained, almost defeated, yet out there beyond the drone of the chirping cicadas, leaving Italians in a limbo between liberation and fear. Among Western nations, Italy was the first to be hit hard by the pandemic. The country learned the loneliness of a new form of death. Its doctors battled in extremis. It watched army trucks transporting coffins to remote cremation sites from the overloaded morgues of Bergamo. Then, strange thing, after some initial missteps, Italy did what it has had the most difficulty doing since the unification of the peninsula in 1861: It cohered into a nation and brought a fierce national will to bear on the virus. It went into disciplined lockdown. It set aside, through a unified front, the old slurs exchanged between northerners and southerners, the old parochialism of city-states with longer histories than the nation they find themselves in, the old derision directed at its politics.
