I’m One of Them.<br></h1><p id="artcont">We can’t succumb to the president’s appeals to fear. By Sara Billups Ms. Billups is a writer. Like many kids who grew up as evangelicals, I was taught that abortion was the only issue when it comes to politics. When I turned 18, in the 1990s, my father took me to the Allen County Republican headquarters in my Indiana town, where I registered as a card-carrying conservative. Then we went to Fort Wayne’s Famous Coney Island for celebratory chili dogs. “It doesn’t matter who is president for a term or two,” Dad told me. “We vote for the candidates who want to protect the dignity of human life.” And those candidates were all in the Republican Party. Though abortion was the core battle, evangelicals have rallied around various flags of the culture wars for my life.
