By Zolan Kanno-Youngs WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Wednesday blocked President Trump’s policy of turning away migrant children at the border as public health risks, ruling that the expulsion of thousands of children without due process exceeded the authority that public health emergency decrees confer. The Trump administration has since March used an emergency decree from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to effectively seal the border to migrants, rapidly returning them to Mexico or Central America without allowing immigration authorities to hear their claims for asylum. Top homeland security officials have cited the potential spread of the coronavirus that could come from detaining asylum seekers in border facilities. But Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, an appointee of President Bill Clinton’s, said that while the emergency rule allows the authorities to prevent the “introduction” of foreigners into the United States, it did not give border authorities the ability turn away children who would normally be placed in shelters and provided an opportunity to have a claim for refuge heard. The order applies across the country. Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, one of four organizations that brought the class-action lawsuit, praised the decision. “The policy, which has already resulted in the summary expulsion of thousands of young children, was simply pretext to do what the Trump administration has wanted to do for four years: close the border to children and asylum seekers from Central America,” he said. It is unclear if the Trump administration will appeal the order. The ruling does not apply to single adults or families crossing the border, although Judge Sullivan did cast doubt on the overall use of the rule. While the judge said the authority granted by the rule was “extraordinary,” he wrote that it was “distinguishable” from whether the rule allowed the government to rapidly turn away migrants.
