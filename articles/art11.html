Now Cases Are Inching Up Again.<br></h1><p id="artcont">The Northeast, devastated by the coronavirus in the spring and held up as a model of infection control by summer, is now seeing early signs of a second wave. By Sarah Mervosh and Julie Bosman In Boston, plans to bring children back to school have been halted as cases of the coronavirus climbed precariously. New virus clusters are emerging in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland and Pennsylvania. In New York City, the number of new cases each day now averages more than 500 for the first time since June. The Northeast, devastated by the coronavirus in the spring and then held up as a model of infection control by summer, is now seeing the first inklings of what might become a second wave of the virus, an ominous prospect for the region and a sharp warning to the rest of the country. The rise in new cases has prompted state and local officials to reverse course, tightening restrictions on businesses, schools and outdoor spaces. In New Jersey, where hospitalizations are on the rise and the rate of infection has almost doubled to nearly eight cases per 100,000 people, towns have closed public parks and picnic areas to discourage people from gathering. Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island extended restaurant capacity limitations for another month, concerned about the stateâ€™s uptick in confirmed cases. On Thursday, several mayors from across New York State rushed to quarantine after appearing at a news conference with another mayor who only later discovered that he was infected with the coronavirus.
