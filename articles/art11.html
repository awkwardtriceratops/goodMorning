It still does. By Jennifer Finney Boylan Contributing Opinion Writer Linda Ronstadt remembers that night: “He came onstage and the place just exploded. He was so dynamic and he was so charismatic and he was so good. And he just ripped the hell out of that piano and sang his ass off.” It was Aug. 25, 1970, the night Elton John became a star, at the Troubadour club in Los Angeles. In the audience were Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Randy Newman, Don Henley, David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash. And Linda Ronstadt. “We were all hanging out in the balcony,” Ms. Ronstadt told me in an interview last week. “He came on and it was like a flash of explosives. And we were hanging over the balcony screaming our guts out.” That night at the Troubadour was captured — with a few surreal embellishments — in the recent bio pic “Rocket Man.” But if you want to hear what Elton John was actually like in those young days, you might listen to the album “11-17-70,” which turned 50 years old last Tuesday. He played that night with the same trio he’d performed with during the Troubadour gig — Nigel Olsson on drums and Dee Murray on bass.
