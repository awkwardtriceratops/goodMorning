By Marc Tracy The New York Times Company announced on Wednesday that Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. will retire as the chairman and as an active member of its board of directors on Dec. 31. He will be succeeded by his son, A.G. Sulzberger, the publisher. Mr. Sulzberger, 69, served as publisher of The Times, overseeing all its editorial and business functions, from 1992 to 2017. He became chairman in 1997 and will assume the title of chairman emeritus. His retirement completes a changing of the guard at the company, coming weeks after Meredith Kopit Levien, previously the chief operating officer, replaced Mark Thompson as the chief executive officer and president. Mr. Thompson, who held the chief executive job for eight years, was appointed to that role by the elder Mr. Sulzberger. “Serving this essential institution and working alongside so many gifted journalists over the years has been the privilege of my life,” Mr. Sulzberger said. “There’s an old saying, ‘Laurels are nice to wear, but never to rest upon.’ I know A.G. will not rest in his drive to empower our journalists and expand the scope of The Times’s ambitions. And with a dynamic new C.E.O. and the best executive editor in the business, I depart knowing the best is yet to come.” The Times has been run by the Ochs-Sulzberger family since 1896, when its patriarch, Adolph S. Ochs, bought the paper in a bankruptcy sale. Arthur Sulzberger was the fifth publisher in its history.
