No deaths were reported in Mexico. By Kirk Semple MEXICO CITY — Hurricane Delta made landfall in southeastern Mexico near the tip of the Yucatán Peninsula early Wednesday, knocking out power, felling trees, shattering windows and causing scattered flooding in cities and towns along the Caribbean coast. But regional and federal officials said they had received no reports of deaths. The storm hit near the port town of Puerto Morelos, just south of a major Mexican tourism destination, Cancún, around 6:30 a.m. Eastern time, with maximum winds estimated at 110 miles per hour, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. By early afternoon, the center of the storm had crossed the peninsula and moved into the Gulf of Mexico, north of the Dzilam de Bravo State Reserve.

But forecasters predicted that the storm would again gather strength as it barreled across the warm waters of the southern and central Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday and Thursday before approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States on Friday.

As of late Wednesday, Delta was moving northwest at about 17 miles per hour with maximum sustained winds of about 90 miles per hour and higher gusts, the National Hurricane Center said. The governors of Alabama and Louisiana declared states of emergency on Tuesday, and several coastal areas began mandatory evacuations on Wednesday. College football officials said Wednesday morning that Saturday’s game between Louisiana State University and the University of Missouri would be moved from Baton Rouge, La., to Columbia, Mo. The Southeastern Conference, whose membership includes both schools as well as 12 other universities, also left open the possibility that the storm would affect other athletic events in the coming days. In Mexico, Luís Alberto Ortega Vázquez, a top official with the national civil protection agency, said Wednesday morning that there had been no immediate accounts of deaths from the storm but said that the authorities had received reports of fallen trees and damage to the Yucatán Peninsula’s electrical grids. Though the hurricane’s impact in Mexico was apparently not as severe as anticipated when it reached Category 4 status on Tuesday night, the storm will almost certainly set back the Yucatán Peninsula’s efforts to revive its tourism industry, which has been severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic. “What we have to do is get back on our feet quickly,” Carlos Orvañanos Rea, spokesman for the government of the state of Quintana Roo, said on Wednesday in an interview with the FOROtv cable news channel. “We are on a path of economic reactivation.”
