The administration hurts the country by not cooperating with President-elect Biden. By Susan E. Rice Ms. Rice is a former national security adviser. Transitions? I’ve seen a few. Since 2000, I have participated in three prior presidential transitions from the vantage points of both the departing and the incoming administration. This year, although I serve on the Biden-Harris transition advisory board, I am not a member of the transition team and, as always, these views are my own. Each transition I experienced was different, but what they shared was a recognition that our country’s national security is best served when both sides endeavor to have a responsible handoff of power. Conversely, it is undermined when either side refuses to engage the other seriously. In the week since Joe Biden’s victory became clear, President Trump and his administration have taken no steps toward starting the process of transition. The risks to our national security are mounting. My first transition began in December 2000, soon after the Supreme Court declared George W. Bush the winner of the disputed election. As the assistant secretary of state for African affairs, I was the first bureau chief to meet with the incoming secretary of state, Gen. Colin Powell. President-elect Bush and his senior national security team had begun receiving the president’s daily intelligence briefing and had access to critical information. But the normal process that follows “ascertainment” — in which the incoming administration sends teams to each department to receive detailed information on policy, budget, personnel and other matters — had awaited the Supreme Court’s Dec. 12 Bush v. Gore decision. I was struck immediately by Secretary-designate Powell’s unique style. He came alone to the State Department — cool, confident, casually dressed and without staff members, bag-carriers or pretense of any sort. He asked to meet with me and the Africa bureau first, presumably to send the message that he would treat this sometimes-under-appreciated region of the world with the seriousness it deserves. Mr. Powell asked thoughtful, probing questions and brought his signature dignity and professionalism to every encounter with the departing administration. Despite the abbreviated transition timetable and the controversy surrounding the election, we on the exiting Clinton team did our utmost to provide Mr. Powell with everything that he might want in terms of information and support. In 2008, I was a co-leader of President-elect Barack Obama’s national security transition team and was named United Nations ambassador-designate. I had started working with the General Services Administration before the election to ensure that the office space allotted to the president-elect’s team would be suitable for all of our needs, including the handling of classified information. Swiftly granted a top-secret security clearance, I received access to the president’s intelligence briefing in order to help facilitate the smooth transfer of sensitive security information from one team to the next. Later, I was provided full support by my predecessor at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, and his team, as I sought to prepare for confirmation and quickly get up to speed.
