The focus on the post office – which only flared as an issue a week or so ago – shows that the Democrats want to make it a core rallying cry. If Amy Klobuchar mentions announcing her campaign during a snowstorm, we drink. You wonder if Amy Klobuchar will refuse to give up the stage and will just keep speaking live from St. Paul. That “change of address card” line was vintage Klobuchar. Let’s not forget that Klobuchar endorsed Biden when it really mattered. That’s part of why she’s getting this spot and other 2020 candidates are getting a group shot. SO true Nick. Klobuchar’s humor was often deployed in the primary, with mixed success. Wonder how these jokes play at home. No candidate in this race was more quotable and more available to be quoted than Amy Klobuchar. I, for one, miss her. Question for the group: Did any Democratic presidential also-rans elevate their profile more than Klobuchar? From where they started to where they finished? Maybe Andrew Yang? Blizzard! Lisa nails it, as ever. Lisa called it. Nick, can I answer with the negative? Did anyone lose more ground than Beto? Be nice to Beto! Klobuchar had a great run, honestly. She definitely came out with a stronger national brand. It’s the Unity montage hour. Steyer got a shot in this montage? Where’s John Delaney? You know, speaking of also-rans who are getting shut out: the loudest grumbling about speakers left out came from the Julián Castro camp. Was that a Seth Moulton sighting? Yes! Folks, I do not see Bill de Blasio. FYI. Or Marianne Williamson! Nor did any voters, Matt. I also think that’s the first “God love ya” from Biden, right? A constant theme: Biden’s capacity for empathy. Expect it all week. Jay Inslee did well for himself during the campaign too. He elevated his profile and made himself the tribune of the environmental movement. This montage seems light on New York City mayors who ran for president recently. No Rudy, Michael? Nor Bloomy, Matt! Booker’s “we’ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president” was also his pivot to the close of his stump speech. This from Eva Longoria is the first explicit appeal to send money to the Biden campaign. Noticed that too, Reid, especially as Biden’s Twitter account has been directing followers to donate to Senate campaigns. This segment was introduced by Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of the Biden campaign. He’s also the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and a representative from Louisiana. Wait, did it take 90 minutes to get to Amtrak Joe? So many political reporters feeling homesick for the Acela right now. Interesting to see how far Sherrod Brown’s “the dignity of work” has made it into the Democratic lexicon. Richmond used it as his closing. The second hour has been heavier on Biden bio, it seems. And heavier on Amtrak. Getting nostalgic for crowded train travel. Strange times. Same here. Biden bio fact: The Amtrak station in Wilmington, Del., is called the Joseph R. Biden Jr. Railroad Station. These pictures of Biden on the train are yet another striking contrast to Trump, who hasn’t used commercial travel of any kind in decades. Belated Fun Fact Check: Klobuchar is right that Trump did retweet a post about his cameo being cut from “Home Alone 2” airings in Canada, and suggested it was because Prime Minister Trudeau “doesn’t much like my making him pay up on NATO or Trade!” and called the prime minister of Denmark “nasty” for objecting to his idea of buying Greenland. Going from Republican parade to Sanders in a night is quite the political whiplash. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
