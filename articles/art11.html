It Still Haunts Me.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Credit...Photo illustration by Victoria Villasana Supported by By Hawra al-Nadawi It was early in 1991 when they came to take my father again. The previous times, I was too young to remember, but this time I was almost 6, and my memory was strong enough that the sounds and images from that day would haunt me forever. We lived in the Adhamiya neighborhood of east Baghdad, close to the Tigris River, in a tiny bungalow my father built after an earlier stint in prison. I was playing outside with the neighbor children when a car pulled up. It was a civilian car, and the two men inside were not wearing uniforms. One of them stepped out and very casually, as if I was supposed to know who he was, asked me to fetch my father for him. “Baba, your friend wants you!” I shouted into the house from the front door, not wanting to enter and risk forfeiting the precious last few minutes of my playtime. A moment later, my father appeared, a hand raised in greeting. “Give me a minute to change,” he said to the man, as if pleasantly surprised to see him. “You don’t need to,” the man said. “This will only take a few minutes.” But my mother, having rehearsed this moment countless times in her mind, quickly retrieved the clothes he wanted. My father changed right there in front of us, calmly and without hesitation, while the man stood by impatiently and told him to hurry. Before they left, my father kissed me goodbye. I do not recall my mother’s reaction as the car sped off, whether she burst into tears or swallowed her grief and kept pretending that nothing was wrong, but I know now that she was thinking that we might never see my father again. The secret police were exuberant practitioners of the bait-and switch. “A few minutes” in their parlance, could mean anything from a few hellish days of interrogations to life in prison. Or, just as likely, death by execution. My mother was wise to the tactic because they had once tried it on her. This was in December 1984, when they arrested my entire family. I have no memory of that day, because I was only 4 months old, but my mother has told me that the arresting officer instructed her to leave me on the floor of our home as she was being led out the door, falsely assuring her that she would be back soon. She still gets choked up talking about it. “What would have happened to you if I’d believed him?” she’ll say. “What if I had left you?” I have grappled with that question myself. Perhaps I would have died there on the floor. Or maybe the neighbors would have heard my screams and come to my rescue. Instead, my mother persuaded the officer to let me go with her. It was a gamble. She didn’t know where they were taking us or for how long. Furthermore, she was Kurdish, a second-class citizen in the eyes of the regime — not to mention married to a political subversive. Not long before the men from state security came to arrest us, some of my father’s fellow dissidents were captured, and my father had made a plan to take the family out of the country through Kurdistan. He managed to reach the border, but the authorities had been alerted and he had to turn back. So the knock on the door that day was not unexpected. In the Republic of Fear that Saddam Hussein created, ordinary Iraqis were split between those who mindlessly defended the dictator’s absurd whims and those who kept silent and survived by trying to make themselves invisible. And then there were people like my father, the rebels, who opposed the regime actively and at great risk — not just to themselves but also to everyone they loved. As with all despots, collective punishment was a hallmark of Hussein’s survival strategy. Wherever resistance raised its head, the heavy hammer of the law fell. In this way, the regime multiplied its enemies and stoked the animosities that would later erupt in civil war. Although now, 17 years after the overthrow of Hussein, as many of Iraq’s youth rise up in solidarity against the corrupt and incompetent government that replaced him, to me his most enduring legacy is not the divisions he created but rather the impulse to transcend them. The world may have given up on Iraq, written it off as a lost cause, but from my vantage point, as someone marked at infancy as an enemy of tyrants, a rebel by birthright, I see quite the opposite. I see hope. In 1984, we certainly weren’t the only family in prison, but we must have been one of the biggest. In addition to my parents and me, the security services had also detained my maternal grandparents, as well as nine of my aunts and uncles, four of whom were minors. We were split up: The men were sent to Abu Ghraib, just west of Baghdad, and the women were sent across town to Al Rashad. My mother was a 23-year-old university student, anxious and fearful, suddenly faced with the unfathomable responsibility of caring for an infant in a squalid, overcrowded prison. She tells me that during those first dreadful days as a prisoner, she never put me down, afraid that if she did I would be taken away from her. Naturally, she was also worried that the filthy jail floor would be a hazard for her infant.
