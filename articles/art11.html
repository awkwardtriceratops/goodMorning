By Noel Murray and Scott Tobias Sean Connery died Saturday at the age of 90. Best known for originating the role of James Bond in movies, the Scottish actor had a career that lasted nearly 60 years, most of which he spent playing a variety of “man’s man” roles — from suave spies to violent brutes. At a time when most popular British thespians were known as Shakespearean-trained aesthetes, Connery became an international star with a screen presence that was earthier and sexier. His musical highland burr and awe-inspiring physicality immediately drew eyes and ears, even when he was playing opposite some of the most accomplished and attractive performers of his generation. These 15 movies go beyond Bond (though there a couple of can’t-miss 007 adventures in there) to illustrate how Connery commanded the screen, from his roguish youth to his distinguished latter years. 1963 Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play and Vudu. “Dr. No” introduced James Bond to the big screen, but the second film in the series beefed up the mythology, expanding the entire concept of a superspy suavely combating would-be world conquerors. In the character’s first heyday, Connery grounded the increasingly outlandish gadgets, villains, sidekicks, and femmes fatale. While later Bonds (including some played by Connery) would became almost too cartoonishly glib, the 007 in “From Russia With Love” has a certain gruff gravity, even as he’s effortlessly seducing women and dispatching SPECTRE operatives. 1964 Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play and Vudu. The third of the Connery Bonds established many tropes of the series: The stand-alone pre-credits action sequence, a tricked-out Aston Martin DB5, the eye-catching international locales and an array of silly gadgetry. (Bond is advised never to use the passenger-side ejector seat button, which of course only raises expectations.) “Goldfinger” is absurd beyond parody, with one of the best (and most plausible) evil-villain schemes in the franchise, and its lightness of touch makes it a standout among early 007 adventures. It’s the sort of movie where Bond has to free himself from a metal slab while a laser beam slowly moves toward his body. 1964 Stream it on Peacock Premium. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. In one of Alfred Hitchcock’s more disturbing thrillers, Connery plays the wealthy Mark Rutland, drawn to Marnie (played by Tippi Hedren), whom he knows to be psychologically damaged. He marries her anyway, and dedicates time and resources to fixing her wide range of problems — from kleptomania to a violent fear of sex. As played by Connery (and written by the screenwriter Jay Presson Allen, adapting Winston Graham’s novel), Mark can be seen either as the kindly guardian of a troubled person or as a total sicko who gets off on controlling someone too broken to fight back. 1965 Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. While Connery was becoming one of the world’s most popular movie stars as James Bond, he consciously took roles in films that let him show different sides of his personality and talent. The director Sidney Lumet pushed the star to give his best performance of the 1960s in an adaptation of Ray Rigby’s play “The Hill,” about a brutal British military prison designed to break the spirits of insubordinate soldiers. In a complex study of how the values of strength and discipline sometimes conflict, Connery plays a former officer who challenges the authority of his jailers and becomes a hero to his fellow inmates. 1974 Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. The image of a pony-tailed Connery with a Fu Manchu mustache, thigh-high boots and a red loincloth has been known to turn some potential viewers away from the writer-director John Boorman’s visionary postapocalyptic allegory. But if you can accept that a lot of the silliness in “Zardoz” is purposeful, it’s surprisingly easy to fall under Boorman’s strange spell, and to appreciate Connery’s fearless performance as a rebellious warrior whose terrifying rawness shakes up a utopian society of timid intellectuals. 1974 Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. In Sidney Lumet’s hit adaptation of the Agatha Christie whodunit, Connery joins a cast of international stars (Ingrid Bergman, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, and John Gielgud among them) who fall under the penetrating gaze of Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) after a passenger is murdered on a train. There’s not much to “Murder on the Orient Express” as cinema, since the bulk of the film involves Poirot interrogating the passengers one by one in the same train car. But it’s the ultimate brainteaser for amateur sleuths in the audience, even if they’re unlikely to see the big twist coming. 1975 Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. Connery had one of his best screen partners in Michael Caine, in the director John Huston’s extraordinarily entertaining adaptation of Rudyard Kipling’s rip-roaring novella. The pair play globe-hopping mercenaries and con men who stumble into an Afghan community where they’re briefly hailed as gods. A tongue-in-cheek take on old-fashioned Victorian adventure, the film sees Connery doing what’s almost a spoof of the classic British pulp hero — more dim and thuggish than noble. 1976 Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube
