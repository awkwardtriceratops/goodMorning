By Gail Collins and Bret Stephens Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every week. Bret Stephens: Gail, it’s as if someone dared 2020 to get worse, and 2020 replied: “Just try me.” Right now I’m just sitting on my porch, awaiting a plague of locusts. Gail Collins: Yeah, the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a real blow. The loss of a great American combined with the realization that Mitch McConnell is now the happiest guy in the world. All his evil deeds thwarting President Obama’s judicial nominations are paying off big time. Bret: One of the ways in which I measure Ginsburg’s impact is to see how deeply her death has affected my daughters as well as my mother. My mom remembers what life was like when the only degree women were expected to earn was a “Mrs.” And my daughters recognize the role Ginsburg played in opening a world of personal and professional possibility for them. As for McConnell, I’ll invite our readers to help me rewrite the lyrics of the Rolling Stones classic, “Sympathy for the Devil.” Please allow me to introduce myself, I’m a majority leader in great haste/I’ve been around for a long, long year/Stole Garland’s nomination, sealed his fate …. Gail: I think we’ve got a hit on our hands … Bret: My hope here is that Mitt Romney will join Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins and hoist McConnell on his own petard by refusing to vote for any nominee until the election is decided. Gail: Yeah, and some other endangered Republicans from blue states, like Cory Gardner of Colorado, would have to be worried about taking a screw-the-election stand. We need four altogether.
