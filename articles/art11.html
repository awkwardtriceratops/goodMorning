Take a Look<br></h1><p id="artcont">The throngs of visitors have disappeared from New York City’s famous neighborhood, and there is an eeriness to the emptiness. By Corey Kilgannon A tour bus agent desperately tried to discern which passers-by were New Yorkers and which ones were out-of-towners. Newlyweds from Maryland, hoping to celebrate their nuptials with a special dinner, had to settle for McDonald’s. Four homeless men sat on a sidewalk, sharing cigarettes and a pipe filled with marijuana. This is Times Square, jarringly quiet beneath flashing billboards. Times Square needs a crowd, which is as much a part of its character as the incessant lights. “Look around,” said Ronnie Boyd, 54, from Brooklyn, who has been selling souvenir hats and T-shirts on the sidewalk in the area since 2004. “Without the Broadway shows, the office workers, the tourists, the crowds, you got no Times Square.” The throngs of visitors — the trademark of the famous neighborhood for more than a century — are gone. The air is no longer thick with the aroma of hot dogs and roasting nuts. Broadway theaters are closed. Office buildings, which drew a daily work force of millions, are nearly vacant. And there is an eeriness to the emptiness, helping to stir the faint fear that Times Square could slip back to its 1970s self, a seamy neighborhood known for open crime, drugs and sex shows. The neighborhood’s transformation — from gritty to “Disney” — was a significant chapter in the revitalization of New York City, even as detractors criticized the new Times Square as losing its edge. Times Square has an outsized share of the city’s economic activity, despite occupying only 0.1 percent of the city’s land mass, said Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, the area’s business improvement district. Before the pandemic, the square, where Broadway meets Seventh Avenue from 42nd to 47th streets, helped to draw a crush of tourists to the city. A record 66.6 million visited the city in 2019, with many making their way to a show, the New Year’s Eve ball drop or to a little patch of sidewalk just to stand beneath all those lights. That level of tourism is not likely to return until 2024, according to one forecast. Times Square is now a microcosm of the city’s struggle to survive the pandemic, as restaurants and businesses close and residents lose their jobs. There are no crowds to shield and disguise the population of homeless people, mostly men, living there on the street. “Times Square has always been New York on steroids, so whatever is happening in New York City is amplified in Times Square,” said Mr. Tompkins. Beginning in August, overnight counts tallied by Times Square Alliance staffers reported that the number of people sleeping on the street in Times Square was roughly double the 2019 levels, and many are “much more aggressive with passers-by or are ignoring social distancing,” said Mr. Tompkins. Despite the shortage of tourists, Ruth Njuguna, the tour bus agent, still searched for likely customers to consider her sales pitch, passing out pamphlets and wearing a placard around her neck bearing her name, “Miss Ruth.” “People came from all over the world to Times Square, and now they’re just not coming,” she said. Before the pandemic, willing tourists would buy up to 100 tickets a day, Ms. Njuguna said, which allowed her to support her two children in the Bronx and send some money home to relatives in Kenya. Now, there are days when she may sell merely two or three tickets. Visitors have slowly returned, especially on nights and weekends. And the district has re-emerged occasionally as a central gathering spot for events such as Black Lives Matter protests and celebrations after President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory was declared. Still, the district feels empty by Times Square standards. About 108,000 pedestrians pass through the area each day compared with 380,000 before the pandemic. Over the extended Thanksgiving weekend, Times Square had a third of the usual foot traffic, the alliance said. Mr. Tompkins said it was still unclear whether December would bring a holiday bump, given the pandemic restrictions. The office towers largely remain empty, and most of the hotels in the area have closed, at least temporarily, including the 478-room Hilton Times Square, as have stores like Old Navy and the U.S. Polo Association. Restaurants such as Planet Hollywood, the Hard Rock Café and Dave and Buster’s have not yet reopened.
