By Michael Levenson The actress Lori Loughlin reported to federal prison on Friday, five months after she and her husband pleaded guilty to charges that they conspired to have their two daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as rowing recruits, even though neither participated in the sport. Ms. Loughlin, 56, reported to the federal prison in Dublin, Calif., to begin a two-month sentence, according to prosecutors, who said Ms. Loughlin had agreed that she would not seek early release because of the coronavirus pandemic. She had initially been scheduled to report to prison on Nov. 19, but prosecutors said they had reached an agreement to allow her to begin her sentence early. The actress Felicity Huffman, who admitted in May to paying $15,000 to arrange for a proctor to illicitly correct her daughterâ€™s SAT responses, served 11 days at the same prison, 35 miles east of San Francisco, which houses more than 870 female inmates. Ms. Loughlin has also been sentenced to two years of supervised release, during which time she must complete 100 hours of community service and pay a $150,000 fine, prosecutors said. Ms. Loughlin and Ms. Huffman were among the highest-profile defendants in the nationwide admissions prosecution, in which financiers, lawyers and celebrities were charged with conspiring to cheat on exams or bribe coaches, showing the lengths to which some wealthy parents go to get their children into prestigious colleges.
