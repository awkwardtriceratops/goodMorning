By Eve Fairbanks Ms. Fairbanks has contributed articles to The New Republic, The Washington Post and other publications. The morning after President Trump announced his coronavirus diagnosis, a relative who supports him texted me. “OMG Trump,” she wrote. “It’s the end.” My relative was adamant that Mr. Trump’s bid for a second term was finished. So adamant, actually, that it sounded as if she wanted it to be over. I noticed a similar attitude of resignation, even relief, from Trump supporters I follow on social media. They expressed strangely little anxiety that Mr. Trump would get very sick or die. Compassion for his suffering, yes. Anger at Democrats’ schadenfreude, yes. But no fear he would be swept off the political stage. My relative mentioned she was listening to Rush Limbaugh’s radio show. The gist of the segment, she said, was that “love him or hate him, Trump was larger than life.” She made Mr. Limbaugh’s monologue sound like a eulogy, and I tuned in just in time for a caller to tell the pro-Trump host: “I would have thought you were eulogizing the president.” You were talking about him, the caller continued, “like he was in the past tense.”
