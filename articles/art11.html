Matt Hancock, the health secretary, labeled the first day of inoculations “V-Day,” evoking V-E Day and V-J Day, which marked the end of World War II.   Amid the optimism, there is also concern. Has the vaccine been developed too fast? Is it safe? On today’s episode, we ask Britons how they feel about the prospect of receiving a shot and attend a vaccination site in Wales. Megan Specia, a story editor for The New York Times.   For the first recipients of the vaccine, among them older Britons and hundreds of doctors and nurses who pulled the National Health Service through the pandemic, the shots offered a glimpse at a return to normalcy. Dr. Chris Hingston was one of the first health care workers in Britain to receive the vaccine. He was clearly aware that the simple act had a greater purpose: protecting not only himself, but hopefully his family, colleagues and patients from a potentially life-threatening virus.
