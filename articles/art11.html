Then He Began Serving Trump’s Political Agenda.<br></h1><p id="artcont">The director of national intelligence is said to be planning more disclosures of intelligence that undermines the Russia investigation. By Julian E. Barnes and Adam Goldman WASHINGTON — During his confirmation hearing in May to oversee the nation’s spy agencies, John Ratcliffe, then a lawmaker from Texas, promised senators skeptical of his vocal support for President Trump that he would be “entirely apolitical as the director of national intelligence.” A few months into his tenure, Mr. Ratcliffe has emerged as anything but. He has approved selective declassifications of intelligence that aim to score political points, left Democratic lawmakers out of briefings, accused congressional opponents of leaks, offered Republican operatives top spots in his headquarters and made public assertions that contradicted professional intelligence assessments. None of the moves have dismayed his critics, or intelligence officials inside the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency, as much as Mr. Ratcliffe’s decision to release unverified intelligence last week that mentioned Hillary Clinton. Intelligence professionals said the material could be Russian disinformation, but even if its substance — that Russian intelligence had information that Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 campaign planned to tie Mr. Trump to the Kremlin’s election hacks — were true, it hardly demonstrated anything nefarious about her. No matter. Republicans claimed it showed Mrs. Clinton was part of a “deep state” plot to undermine the president by investigating his campaign’s ties to Russia, and Mr. Trump made a glancing reference to the unverified intelligence in the first presidential debate. Gina Haspel, the director of the C.I.A., opposed the declassifications, saying that the release of the unverified raw material could jeopardize spies’ ability to gather intelligence and endanger their sources, according to two people familiar with the matter. But Mr. Ratcliffe, who has the authority to release intelligence, and Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, favored the move, the people said.
