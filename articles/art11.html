He’ll Need Some Help From Xi Jinping.<br></h1><p id="artcont">The U.S.-China relationship is at its lowest point in a half century, but there are also converging interests on global warming. By Somini Sengupta If Joseph R. Biden Jr. wants to be known as the first climate president of the United States, he will have to engage his biggest rival on the world stage: President Xi Jinping of China. Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi, though, are locked in a very difficult relationship that makes climate cooperation a bit like a couple in divorce court trying to plan their child’s wedding. And, unfortunately for the American president-elect, he won’t be starting from a position of strength. Mr. Xi’s China, which on Friday ended days of conspicuous silence on the election result by congratulating Mr. Biden, dominates the production of clean energy goods, including solar panels and electric vehicles. The Chinese president faces none of the domestic political chaos that confronts Mr. Biden and potentially impedes the president-elect’s ability to implement some of his most ambitious campaign promises on climate change. And Mr. Xi has already deflated Mr. Biden’s ability to project the United States as a climate leader by announcing, in September, an ambitious, albeit vague, target to draw down China’s carbon emissions to net-zero by 2060. “Kind of trolling the U.S.,” said Alex Wang, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who follows Chinese climate law and policy.
