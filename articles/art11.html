Court Rules Against Hungary Law Targeting Soros-Funded University<br></h1><p id="artcont">The ruling comes as the bloc pushes back against a growing authoritarianism by the government of Viktor Orban, but is unlikely to have much effect on the ground. By Benjamin Novak BUDAPEST — The European Court of Justice ruled on Tuesday that Hungary had violated E.U. rules by changing legislation in 2017 that effectively expelled an American university founded by the billionaire financier George Soros from the country. “The conditions introduced by Hungary to enable foreign higher education institutions to carry out their activities in its territory are incompatible with E.U. law,” the court’s ruling said. The decision was the latest effort by the European Union to curb growing authoritarianism by the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, but is unlikely to have much impact on the ground in Hungary.
