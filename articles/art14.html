I saw the looming return of annoying beauty standards for women. By Jennifer Weiner Contributing Opinion Writer The coronavirus is the gift that keeps on giving. It’s given us sickness and death and lingering ailments that may affect sufferers for years. It’s given us joblessness, evictions and mile-long lines of minivans at food banks. It’s given us xenophobia, kids stuck at home and “remote learning” where there’s plenty of remote and precious little learning. It’s given us depression and anxiety, stress-snacking and spousal squabbles, insomnia and, with it, extra time to worry about election night Armageddon. But not all of its gifts have been malign. In addition to all of the bad, the pandemic has also given us the rare sight of women in the public eye without the ministrations of their glam squads. In the Before, the standard look for a female newscaster or a politician or an Instagram influencer involved styled hair, a full face of makeup (primer, foundation, concealer, contour and blush) and eyelash extensions from here to the moon. There were exceptions, but that was the rule. In the Now, unless celebs have quarantine-bubbled up with their hair and makeup team (translation: unless they’ve refused to let them go home), professionally prepped faces have given way to D.I.Y. attempts. Those long, long lashes are, for the most part, long gone; the blowouts are imperfect. And that — along with pets strolling through remote news reports and glimpses of public figures’ personal spaces — has been kind of delightful.
