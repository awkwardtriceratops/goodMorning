My son’s school — well, it might check air circulation with a yardstick and toilet paper. By Cynthia Nixon Ms. Nixon, an actor and advocate, was a candidate for the 2018 Democratic nomination for New York governor. This summer, I participated in two back-to-back phone calls about resuming some semblance of normal life in New York City — which for me means resuming work on a television show and sending my 9-year-old son, Max, back to school. The differences in these phone calls could not have been starker, and taught me a great deal about in whom and what we invest in the era of Covid-19. On the call related to my show, I heard about the many tours the industrial hygienist had taken of the set and about the renovation of some of our work spaces to be Covid-safe. Out of an abundance of caution, even some spaces that looked fairly healthy had been eliminated. I also heard about how the crew and production staff would be divided into strict pods; they would be tested before they started work and then tested one to three times a week. Actors, who need to remove their masks, would be tested every day. Anyone coming to New York from out of state would need to quarantine for two weeks before being allowed on set.
