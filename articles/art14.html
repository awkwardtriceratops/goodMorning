By Esther Salas Ms. Salas is a United States District Court judge for the District of New Jersey and sits in Newark. “Let’s keep talking; I love talking to you, Mom.” Those were the last words spoken to me by my only child, Daniel, as we cleaned up the basement from his birthday festivities. He was still glowing from a glorious weekend at home with his parents and friends. Then the doorbell rang. Daniel raced up the stairs. Seconds later, as I stood alone in our basement, my beloved son was shot to death. Mark Anderl, my husband of 25 years, was shot three times and critically injured. This tragedy, every mother’s worst nightmare, happened for a reason wholly unrelated to either my husband or my son, but because of my job: I am a United States District Court judge. A lawyer who had appeared before me was angered by the pace of a lawsuit he had filed in my court. He came to my home seeking revenge. My attacker sought to hurt me but his ire, and his focus, were not unique. Federal judges are at risk from other would-be attackers. For judges and their families, better security is a matter of life and death. But its importance goes beyond our well-being alone. For our nation’s sake, judicial security is essential. Federal judges must be free to make their decisions, no matter how unpopular, without fear of harm. The federal government has a responsibility to protect all federal judges because our safety is foundational to our great democracy. Since Daniel’s death, I have vowed to do everything I can to make similar tragedies less likely. Last month New Jersey passed what is known as “Daniel’s Law,” which prohibits the distribution of personal information, including home addresses and phone numbers, for judges, prosecutors and law enforcement personnel. After Daniel’s death, I learned from F.B.I. agents that it’s easy to find personal information about judges on the internet. Judges’ addresses can be purchased online for just a few dollars, including photos of our homes and the license plates on our vehicles. In my case, this deranged gunman was able to create a complete dossier of my life: he stalked my neighborhood, mapped my routes to work and even learned the names of my best friend and the church I attend. All of which was completely legal. This access to such personal information enabled this man to take our only child from my husband, Mark, and me. Now the United States Senate needs to pass the Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act, which would provide further protections for federal judges. Identical legislation has been introduced in the House. The bipartisan bill would protect judges’ personally identifiable information from resale by data brokers. It would also allow federal judges to redact personal information displayed on federal government internet sites and prevent publication of personal information by other businesses and individuals where there is no legitimate news media interest or matter of public concern. It would also encourage states to protect personal information, improve the ability of the United States Marshals Service to identify threats and authorize upgrades to judges’ home security systems. The ambush that took my son and gravely wounded my husband is not the first such attack. In 2005, United States District Judge Joan Lefkow of Chicago returned home to find her mother and husband killed by an angry litigant. Since 1979, four federal judges have been murdered. The threat to judges is intensifying. Security incidents targeting judges and other personnel who play integral roles in federal court cases rose to 4,449 threats and inappropriate communications in 2019, from 926 such incidents in 2015, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. On Oct. 31, a federal judge in Houston learned from a former law clerk that his home address had been posted on Twitter. On Nov. 25, an intruder entered a judge’s chambers in Southern California, threatening to kill the judge and striking and damaging his desk with a metal cane which was later found to hold a metal blade. The assailant fled after the judge, who was physically unharmed, called 911. In my case, Roy Den Hollander, a New York lawyer who had filed a suit against the male-only military draft, harbored deadly grudges. On July 11, 2020, he killed a lawyer in California. Eight days later, he came to our door and killed Daniel. Too late, I learned that he had often described himself as “anti-feminist.” In a self-published memoir, he described me as “a lazy and incompetent Latina judge appointed by Obama.” A determined killer will always be difficult to stop, but we make it far too easy to locate judges. Removing our personally identifiable information from the internet is a critical first defense. It is also essential to make judges’ homes safer. In 2005, after the attack on Judge Lefkow’s family, Congress funded security systems for judges’ homes. These measures are badly in need of an update to include external video and other safety features common in commercially available home security systems. In my house, the only way to see who has come to the front door is to peek through a bay window. In mid-July, after four months of Covid-19 restrictions, home deliveries occurred almost daily. Daniel’s killer took advantage of this familiar routine, coming to our door posing as a Fed-Ex delivery courier. Investigators told me they believe Daniel thwarted a planned attack on me by stepping toward the gunman. My husband slowed the attack further by staying on his feet even after he was hit by three gunshots at close range. By the time I reached the main floor, the attacker had fled. If Daniel’s death shows our country anything, it is that threats against federal judges are real, that they have dire consequences. Even at the age of 20, my son cared deeply about other people, and he bravely, and selflessly, protected those he loved most. We, too, must be brave and do what is right to ensure that judges can perform their duties without fear that they or their families will be gunned down where they are most vulnerable. Daniel’s death is speaking to us, but will we listen? For the sake of my brothers and sisters on the bench, Congress must act now. Every day that goes by without action leaves our federal judges, our justice system and our very democracy in danger.
