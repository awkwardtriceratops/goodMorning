By Cristian Farias Mr. Farias is a journalist who covers legal affairs. Millions of Americans have already cast votes ahead of the election, and democracy demands that one of the candidates on the ballot be the Democrats’ lead questioner at the confirmation hearing for Amy Coney Barrett that begins Monday. Kamala Harris isn’t just a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Republicans control and is rushing madly to ram through President Trump’s chosen replacement for the Supreme Court seat formerly held by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She is also one of the sharpest questioners on the committee, setting herself apart in the nearly four years she has been in the Senate. She has cross-examined everyone from Jeff Sessions to Brett Kavanaugh and William P. Barr. Voters deserve a Senate hearing where a person aspiring to one of the nation’s highest elected offices gets an opportunity to hold to account an unelected judge nominated for a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court. And a nominee whom Mr. Trump is depending on to throw the election to him if it ends up in court, and to give Republicans a generation of 6-to-3 decisions on contentious issues they cannot win legislatively, because their ideas are so unpopular. This is about democracy. As Senator Harris herself observed during Wednesday’s vice-presidential debate, Republicans’ brute-force effort to confirm Judge Barrett as people head to the polls is an affront to voters. “We’re literally in an election,” she said. “Over 4 million people have voted. People have been in the process of voting now.” Her running mate, Joe Biden, who once led the Senate committee on which Ms. Harris sits, echoed that sentiment on Thursday: “The election has begun. There’s never been a court appointment once an election has begun.” That was precisely the Republican argument for denying Democrats a hearing for President Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, in 2016. Senator Harris asking Judge Barrett point-blank what she meant when she said that appointing Judge Garland would “dramatically flip the balance of power” on the Supreme Court would expose this hypocrisy — as well as Judge Barrett’s nakedly political assessment of the Supreme Court’s membership.
