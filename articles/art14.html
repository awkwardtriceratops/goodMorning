Lukashenko’s security forces appear to have shifted from mass repression to more targeted disappearances. By Andrew Higgins MOSCOW — Maria Kolesnikova, the last prominent protest leader in Belarus still at large, vanished on Monday and local news media outlets reported that she had been grabbed off the street by masked kidnappers in the center of the East European nation’s capital, bundled into a dark minivan and driven away at speed. The abduction of Ms. Kolesnikova, the latest in a series of disappearances apparently engineered by Belarus’s security agencies, followed large protests on Sunday in Minsk, the capital, and towns across the country. It seemed to reflect a shift in strategy from the initial frenzy of police violence against protesters to picking off opposition leaders one by one and sending them out of the country.
