Now his site says, in prominent type, “The World Moves On.” By Tiffany Hsu Matt Drudge started showing signs that he had soured on President Trump months before the election. Since the vote, the fedora-topped media pioneer has seemed even more eager to distance himself and his site from the man in the White House. “YOU’RE FIRED!” Drudge Report blared in a headline within minutes of CNN’s calling the election for Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Saturday. For nearly 24 hours afterward, that headline remained at the top of the site. In addition, a screenshot of the Drudge Report main page, with the “YOU’RE FIRED!” headline, has been the only tweet on the @DRUDGE Twitter account since Saturday. In his 25-year career, Mr. Drudge has proved himself an expert aggregator, a digital journalist who links to articles plucked from the web. And he has done it with style, packaging his links with tabloid-poetry headlines that make readers click. After the “YOU’RE FIRED!” headline, Drudge Report turned this week to the coming transfer of power. THE WORLD MOVES ON. Americans pivot from red-hot Trump to Biden’s seasoned cool. Trump defied gravity; now falls back to earth, future TBD.
