It Still Haunts Me.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Credit...Photo illustration by Victoria Villasana Supported by By Hawra al-Nadawi It was early in 1991 when they came to take my father again. The previous times, I was too young to remember, but this time I was almost 6, and my memory was strong enough that the sounds and images from that day would haunt me forever. We lived in the Adhamiya neighborhood of east Baghdad, close to the Tigris River, in a tiny bungalow my father built after an earlier stint in prison. I was playing outside with the neighbor children when a car pulled up. It was a civilian car, and the two men inside were not wearing uniforms. One of them stepped out and very casually, as if I was supposed to know who he was, asked me to fetch my father for him. “Baba, your friend wants you!” I shouted into the house from the front door, not wanting to enter and risk forfeiting the precious last few minutes of my playtime.
