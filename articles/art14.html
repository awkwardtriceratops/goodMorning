By Will Wright, Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and John Eligon LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Two very different accounts emerged on Friday from either side of an apartment door in Louisville, the one that police officers knocked off its hinges in March as they delivered a search warrant at the home of Breonna Taylor. In newly released audio from closed-door grand jury proceedings, there was conflicting testimony over what happened in the seconds before the police shot and killed Ms. Taylor, a Black emergency room technician whose death pulled people to the streets in protests across the country. Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said in the recordings that he was “scared to death” when he and Ms. Taylor heard pounding on the door in the middle of the night and got no response after they yelled, “Who is it?” The officers involved in the raid, though, insisted in interviews with investigators that they had loudly identified themselves as the police before they burst through the door. It was only after one officer was shot by Mr. Walker, they said, that they opened fire at the couple, killing Ms. Taylor. The dueling accounts of a chaotic and tragic night are captured in 15 hours of recordings from the grand jury’s examination of the fatal raid, which was part of a drug investigation targeting a man who was arrested elsewhere. For the first time, some of those directly involved in the police shooting — including neighbors, officers and Mr. Walker — are heard describing the fateful night. “Next thing I know, she’s on the ground and the door’s busted open and I hear a bunch of yelling and just panicking,” Mr. Walker said about Ms. Taylor in an interview with investigators in March that was played for the grand jury last week. “And she’s right here bleeding,” he added. “And nobody’s coming, and I’m just confused and scared.” The grand jury concluded its work by bringing an indictment against one former officer for endangering Ms. Taylor’s neighbors; it brought no charges against the two officers who shot her. Daniel Cameron, the Kentucky attorney general, released the recordings on Friday after a judge ordered him to do so, but the recordings did not include the instructions that prosecutors gave to the 12 jurors. One juror said Mr. Cameron was deflecting blame by saying it was jurors who had opted not to indict the two officers who shot Ms. Taylor. One of those officers, Detective Myles Cosgrove, who the F.B.I. said fired the shot that killed Ms. Taylor, described in the audio being uncertain about exactly what occurred during the chaos after the police used a battering ram to burst into Ms. Taylor’s apartment. “I just sensed that I’ve fired,” Detective Cosgrove said in an interview last month that was played for the jurors. But, he added: “It’s like a surreal thing. If you told me I didn’t do something at that time, I’d believe you. If you told me I did do something, I’d probably believe you, too.” The grand jurors met in person over three days and reviewed police interviews of officers and witnesses at the scene, 911 calls and body camera videos from after Ms. Taylor was shot. They also met directly with detectives who had investigated the killing. At times the jurors sound inquisitive or skeptical on the recordings, peppering the detectives with questions and pointing out inconsistencies in some of the officers’ accounts. Below are highlights of the evidence presented in the new recordings. The audio files do not include statements or recommendations from prosecutors about which charges they think should be brought against the officers who took part in the raid. Mr. Cameron has said that jurors were told that the two officers who shot Ms. Taylor — Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Cosgrove, both of whom are white — were justified in their actions. Mr. Cameron said prosecutors’ statements and jurors’ deliberations “were not recorded, as they are not evidence.” He has insisted that the jurors were given “all of the evidence” and were free to pursue additional charges. His release of the audiotapes came after a grand juror asked for the proceedings to be made public and accused Mr. Cameron of using the jurors to deflect blame over the decision. Grand jurors are given broad powers, but prosecutors often closely guide the jurors and inform them about their role. The process almost always remains secret. The grand jurors indicted Brett Hankison, a former detective, on three counts of “wanton endangerment,” saying Mr. Hankison had recklessly fired his gun into a neighboring apartment during the raid. Detective Cosgrove described a disorienting scene as officers breached Ms. Taylor’s door and seemed to suggest uncertainty about exactly what happened. As soon as he got to the doorway, Detective Cosgrove said in an interview he gave police investigators last month, he was “overwhelmed with bright flashes and darkness, and what I describe as a movie reel that’s doing that ticking where you see white and black, white and black.” Detective Cosgrove said that Sergeant Mattingly, who investigators say was shot in the leg by Mr. Walker, fell to the ground and that he had to step over his wounded colleague. “I know John, my friend that I’ve known for 15 years, has been shot in this confined space,” Detective Cosgrove said in the interview, which was played for the grand jury last week. “And I know this person is down and I sense that there’s still these gunshots happening due to those bright lights. I can’t even explain what it is.” After grand jurors heard a recording of the interview that Detective Cosgrove gave to investigators, one juror asked, “Does he have a history of panic attacks?” An investigator with the attorney general’s office said he did not know. Mr. Hankison, who was fired in June, can be heard on a radio call the night of the raid — released in the new trove of recordings — shouting about someone inside Ms. Taylor’s apartment with an “A.R.” He thought he saw someone inside armed with an AR-15, a type of military-style semiautomatic rifle, Mr. Hankison later explained in a March 25 interview with investigators that was played for the grand jury. No such weapon was found. He also told investigators that he had not anticipated a firefight. He expected one unarmed woman, who had no criminal record, to be home alone, he said. Mr. Walker said that he and Ms. Taylor were watching a movie with the lights off when they heard loud knocking on the door and that they had been “scared to death” when they asked who was there and heard no response. They both got up and began to put their clothes on, he said, with Ms. Taylor asking “at the top of her lungs” who was at the door. Mr. Walker said he fired one shot from his gun before he could see who was there after the police officers knocked the door off its hinges. “All of a sudden, there’s a whole lot of shots,” Mr. Walker said. Mr. Cameron, the attorney general, has said that the police fired a total of 32 rounds, at least six of which struck Ms. Taylor. Mr. Walker said that just after the shooting, an officer told him that he was going to jail for the rest of his life and asked him, “Were you hit by any bullets?” Mr. Walker said that when he replied, “No,” the officer responded by saying, “That’s unfortunate.” In the grand jury room, someone can be heard on the audio saying “that’s not appropriate.” At least two Louisville police officers who raided Ms. Taylor’s apartment said in interviews played for the grand jury that the group had knocked and announced its presence several times before breaking down the door. Detective Cosgrove told investigators that their volume had escalated over 90 seconds from “gentle knocking” to “forceful pounding” to pounding while yelling “police.” Detective Michael Nobles said he had knocked and announced himself for one or two minutes before using a battering ram to force his way into Ms. Taylor’s apartment. Detective Nobles told investigators that he had heard movement and voices, including a female voice, inside the apartment before the police entered. He said it took three knocks with the battering ram to break down the door completely. When he entered the apartment, Mr. Nobles said, it was “pitch black,” and Sergeant Mattingly was quickly shot in the leg. Ms. Taylor’s next-door neighbors said they were awakened by banging but did not hear anyone announce that they were the police, according to interviews they gave to investigators. Once the shooting subsided, the neighbors said, they heard Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend sobbing and screaming for help. One neighbor, Elaine Williams, said she was awakened by what she thought was pounding at her own front door. Thinking that it was morning and that her granddaughter was being dropped off, Ms. Williams said she went to her front door and opened it. “It was dark and she could smell gunpowder,” Detective Herman Hall, an investigator with the attorney general’s office, told grand jurors, reading from notes about the interview with Ms. Williams. He added that she said she thought, “What the hell is going on?” Ms. Williams said she also heard Mr. Walker yelling for help, saying: “Baby, breathe! Baby, breathe! Please breathe!” In previous interviews with The New York Times, 11 of 12 witnesses on the scene that night said they never heard the police identify themselves. One of them said he heard the group say “police” just once. The dozen grand jurors appeared inquisitive throughout the proceedings, asking witnesses about the evidence and sometimes sounding skeptical about what was provided to them. Grand jurors asked whether Mr. Walker, Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend, had been named in the search warrant (he had not), what the officers saw when the apartment door opened, and whether the officers executing the warrant were aware that the police had already found Jamarcus Glover, an ex-boyfriend of Ms. Taylor’s who was the target of the drug investigation. Mr. Glover was in custody by the time the police raided Ms. Taylor’s apartment. The grand jurors asked a detective from the attorney general’s office several questions on the third and final day that they met, just hours before indicting Mr. Hankison. They asked if the police had recovered drugs or money from the apartment; the detective said no, and that the police had not searched the apartment for drugs or paraphernalia after shooting Ms. Taylor. They asked whether he had diagrams of the scene (no) and why the officers’ body cameras were not activated (the detective said he did not know).
