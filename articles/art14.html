By Thomas B. Edsall Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality. How will the winning candidate piece together a victory in 2020? David Byler, a data analyst for The Washington Post who anticipates a Biden victory, sees the presidential election as the first true affirmation in this century of the “The Emerging Democratic Majority,” an argument developed by John Judis and Ruy Teixeira in a prescient 2002 book. Judis and Teixeira contended that a moderate “progressive centrism” — something, in other words, that looks a lot like Bidenism — could gain majority status, consistently taking “professionals by about 10 percent, working women by about 20 percent, keep 75 percent of the minority vote and get close to an even split of white working-class voters.” Byler makes the case that Biden and the Democrats are very likely to emerge from the 2020 election with the backing of this progressive-centrist coalition, positioned to “secure a large, balanced majority capable of enacting new progressive laws and possibly able to mitigate losses in a low-turnout midterm” in 2022. But Byler cautions that the success of any single partisan coalition is likely to be short-lived. In his view, the center-left and center-right coalitions represent a structural aspect of contemporary democratic political competition and that they are likely, over time, to alternate control of the government: If Biden successfully builds the emerging Democratic majority, Republicans will find some way to push back. That’s democracy. Just as Donald Trump found a way through Obama’s supposedly invincible “blue wall,” and Bill Clinton triangulated his way out of the Reagan era, Republicans would eventually find a way around a Biden majority. A less politics-as-usual perspective about where we are headed — a more vivid and embattled way of looking at this election — is put forth by Michael Klarman, a professor at Harvard Law School, in his recent essay “Trump, the Republican Party and the Rule of Law.” “President Trump poses a greater threat to the rule of law than anything Americans have witnessed in generations,” Klarman writes: One would hope that the other branches of the national government would check the President’s assault upon it, but this has not happened. Under Republican control for the first two years of Trump’s presidency, Congress proved more of a willing accomplice to, than a check upon, the President’s assault upon the rule of law. Prompted by the stark difference between these two approaches — the first dispassionate and analytic, the second almost verging on the apocalyptic — I asked a number of experts the question, “What is at stake this year?” Isabel V. Sawhill, a senior fellow at Brookings, replied by email: This is an election less about policy and more about the character of the candidates and the character of the country, with one being a reflection of the other. Should Trump win, it would be a signal that our cultural divisions have gone past the point of no return, that demographic and cultural change has come too fast for many people to handle, that a backlash has reached hurricane proportions. Politics “is now close to a religion,” Sawhill continued: In short, people are no longer voting based on economic self-interest or the policies they favor as much as on the basis of their cultural values, the kind of society in which they want to live, and the kind of person they believe they are. Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard, also expressed a sense that we are in an Armageddon-like battle: “Our democracy as we know it is at stake.” Trump, Enos argues, has ruled in the exact way of leaders in other countries who dismantled democracies. In addition, he has attacked the independent, nonpartisan nature of the modern bureaucratic state — the kind of people who allow us to know if our water is clean, fairly administer our elections, and decide whether to prosecute criminals — in other words, the people who ensure stability and quality of life in a modern state. Enos makes the case that the threat to democracy lies not only in Trump but in the willingness of the Republican Party to ratify his actions: Trump has stoked partisan and racial animus, deepening divisions and raising tensions to a dangerous level. That a leader might do these things is not what puts our democracy at stake but that, once his party fell in line with him, the capacity of other leaders to check him through means like impeachment proved so futile. Larry Bartels, a political scientist at Vanderbilt, is focused on a long-term issue: the partisan consequences of rising levels of racial and ethnic animosity. On Aug. 31, Bartels published “Ethnic antagonism erodes Republicans’ commitment to democracy,” a report based on a January 2020 survey of 1,151 Republican identifiers and Republican-leaning Independents. Bartels reports that: Most Republicans in a January 2020 survey agreed that “the traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.” More than 40 percent agreed that “a time will come when patriotic Americans have to take the law into their own hands. In both cases, most of the rest said they were unsure; only one in four or five disagreed.” The strongest predictor of these anti-democratic views “by far,” according to Bartels, is ethnic antagonism — especially concerns about the political power and claims on government resources of immigrants, African-Americans and Latinos. The corrosive impact of ethnic antagonism on Republicans’ commitment to democracy underlines the significance of ethnic conflict in contemporary U.S. politics. The Bartels survey shows why Trump stresses divisive racial and ethnic themes to mobilize his base: because Republicans are far more receptive than Democrats to Trump’s claims, which was not always the case. Bartels writes: The powerful effects of ethnic antagonism on Republicans’ antidemocratic attitudes underscore the extent to which this particular threat to democratic values is concentrated in the contemporary Republican Party. Seventy-eight percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning Independents in the 2020 survey had ethnic antagonism scores below the fifth percentile of the Republican distribution, while 98 percent had scores below the Republican average. In other words, ethnic antagonism is a far stronger force among Republicans than it is among Democrats. The Trump years have also produced sharp partisan polarization on a measure of racial empathy and resentment between white Democrats and white Republicans. Andrew Engelhardt, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro, found that from 2016 to 2018, the share of white Democrats who fell into the three most racially empathetic categories increased by 50 percent, while the percentage of white Republicans in the three most racially resentful categories grew by 18 percent. Like David Byler, other observers see the 2020 election as a continuation of what has become, in this country, normal political competition. Richard Reeves, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at Brookings, views American politics as shifting back and forth from right to left, with both sides inclined to levels of exaggeration that can be destructive. He wrote by email: Many conservatives believe that the battle for civil rights is over, and that if anything the “pendulum has swung too far.” The political left then encourages this view by declaiming America to be a nation in the grip of deep patriarchal and racist systems that oppress everybody except white men — and that simply doesn’t comport with the experience of many people. Reeves, who came to the United States from England, argues that the loss of faith in progress itself, or at least an apparent inability to both celebrate success and continue to fight for more at the same time is a huge problem in our political discourse. The question for both sides now, in Reeves’s opinion, “is whether their strategic goal is to try to win the culture wars or to de-escalate them.” Reeves continues: The idea of winning the culture war is based on a view that somehow or other we can force an entire nation to adopt our views on a range of issues, from abortion to racism to religion to feminism. Not only is this not possible, it is not desirable. The most contested constituency, this year, is the white electorate which, since the 2016 election, has been moving in a Democratic direction. Brian Schaffner, a political scientist at Tufts and co-director of the Cooperative Election Study, analyzed the study’s latest poll data and found that
