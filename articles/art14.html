He once played the course “well enough to enjoy it, not well enough to brag about it.” But at his home in Greenwich, Conn., a mannequin stands shrouded in one of Augusta National’s famed green jackets, customarily draped on victors of the 86-year-old Masters tournament, one of golf’s four majors, and club members. He purchased it at auction for less than $17,000. “I took a chance because if you really think about it, it’s one of the most iconic pieces of sports memorabilia you could get,” he said in a telephone interview. “I have 400 or 500 pieces, and there are always three or four where people walk in and say, ‘What the heck is that?’ And that’s one of them.” With the exception of the reigning champion’s blazer, which can go home with a winner until he returns it for safekeeping the next year, no jackets are permitted to leave the club’s grounds, at least according to Augusta National’s lore. That has cultivated a widespread belief that almost all of those tailored symbols of golf history — presented annually to winners since 1949 and so renowned that a club official once publicly compared their status to the Statue of Liberty — are confined to several hundred cloistered acres of east Georgia. But that is not true. It has not been true for more than half a century. Perhaps “the most coveted award in all the golfing world,” as Augusta National once put it in a court filing, is to be presented under tightly guarded conditions on Sunday, when this year’s pandemic-delayed Masters is scheduled to conclude. What has become clear in recent years, though, is that for all of the club’s determination, it does not have absolute control over all of the gold-buttoned blazers that are emblems of its power and mystique. Augusta National’s estimated 300 or so members also wear the blazers, like the one O’Brien now has, when they are at the invitation-only club, its roster a Who’s Who of international business, politics, sports and technology. But an unclear number of green jackets also exist in exile as family heirlooms, museum exhibits, showpieces for the wealthy and, at a course near Cleveland, a prized tribute to the man who won the Masters and then became the club’s head pro. Gary Player’s first jacket, which he took back to South Africa with him in a fit of ecstasy in 1961, is still there, having cloaked him as a new champion in Georgia and, from time to time in the decades that followed, as a man having dinner at home. Player being Player, an impish and popular nine-time winner of major tournaments, that has proved acceptable. But the circumstances and desires that can surround one of the most renowned sartorial traditions in sports have sometimes led to trouble, with potential transactions occasionally giving way to trails of litigation and accusations of theft and deceit. A spokesman for Augusta National declined to comment. The club, though, has long asserted that it owns the jackets and loans them to members, who first began to receive blazers in 1937, and winners. In a filing last year with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, lawyers for the club said it had “instituted firm control over the wearing of the Green Jacket through the propagation and enforcement of strict rules in order to protect the brand” and that the blazers “cannot be sold or given to third parties under any circumstances.” Yet the jacket that belonged to Byron Nelson, who won the first of his two Masters titles in 1937, was last known to be in the care of a wealth manager based in London, long after Augusta National retroactively presented blazers to pre-1949 winners.
