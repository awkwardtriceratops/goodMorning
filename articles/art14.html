By Marie Fazio A rapper who boasted in a music video about getting rich by fraudulently applying for unemployment has been accused of using stolen identities to obtain more than $1.2 million in jobless benefits, the authorities said. Fontrell Antonio Baines, 31, who performs as Nuke Bizzle, was arrested on Friday and charged with three felonies: access device fraud, aggravated identity theft and interstate transportation of stolen property, federal prosecutors said. If convicted, he faces up to 22 years in prison. Mr. Baines, who is from Memphis and lives in Los Angeles, used stolen identities to apply for unemployment benefits through California’s Employment Development Department, the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of California said in a statement. The money was distributed as part of a federal program that extended unemployment benefits to self-employed workers, independent contractors and others who found themselves without a safety net during the coronavirus pandemic. The authorities said that 92 debit cards loaded with a total of more than $1.2 million in benefits were mailed to addresses that Mr. Baines had access to in Beverly Hills and the Koreatown neighborhood of Los Angeles. Mr. Baines gained access to more than $704,000 through cash withdrawals, some of which were made in Las Vegas, the authorities said.
