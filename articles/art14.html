By Carole Landry and Hiroko Masuike (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Republicans renominated President Trump on the first day of their convention. Mr. Trump, making his case for re-election as the Republican National Convention kicked off in Charlotte, N.C., continued to attack mail-in voting and leveled unfounded accusations of misconduct against Democrats. “They’re using Covid to steal the election,” he said in an inflammatory speech after his nomination as the party’s presidential candidate in the November election. Above, Mr. Trump speaking to delegates in Charlotte earlier today. Vice President Mike Pence told delegates “the economy is on the ballot.” We have live updates here. Despite rising coronavirus rates, job losses and vanishing savings, Mr. Trump’s approval ratings on the economy remain durable. Our reporter looked at the factors raising the president’s standing on the economy. The convention’s program is heavy on all things Trump, with an appearance by the president every night in prime time, and a lineup featuring Melania Trump and all of the president’s adult children. Tonight, the speakers include Nikki Haley and Donald Trump Jr. Here’s what to watch for. The Times will stream the convention every evening, Monday through Thursday. Join our political reporters for live analysis starting at 8:30 p.m. Eastern. 2. Another U.S. city is reeling after the police shooting of a Black man. Jacob Blake, 29, was in stable condition in a hospital on Monday, a day after he was shot in the back as he tried to get into his car in Kenosha, Wis., a city on the shore of Lake Michigan. Protests erupted on Sunday after the shooting and the authorities ordered a curfew. Demonstrations also broke out in other cities, including Portland, Ore.; Madison, Wis.; and Chicago. Above, garbage trucks were set ablaze on Sunday in Kenosha. Mr. Blake was “shot in the back multiple times,” according to Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Department of Justice is investigating. The officers involved were placed on administrative leave. 3. German doctors treating the Russian dissident Aleksei Navalny said he was poisoned. Mr. Navalny remained in a medically induced coma in stable condition, but his life was not in danger, according to doctors at the hospital in Berlin where he has undergone tests. The specific toxin has not been identified, but more analysis is underway, they said. Above, the police outside the hospital in Berlin. Mr. Navalny, the most vocal critic of President Vladimir V. Putin, was flown to Berlin on Saturday, more than 48 hours after he fell ill. Russian doctors who treated Mr. Navalny had denied finding any evidence of toxins in his system. 4. The first confirmed case of coronavirus reinfection was reported in Hong Kong. A 33-year-old man was infected a second time with the coronavirus four and a half months after his first bout, researchers from the University of Hong Kong said. The new infection was discovered when he returned from a trip to Spain. The finding suggests that immunity to the virus may last only a few months in some people. In other developments: A judge in Florida struck down a state order requiring most schools to reopen for in-person instruction. European governments have extended billions of euros to businesses to keep people employed during the pandemic. But layoffs are coming anyway. Usain Bolt, the Olympic track great who won eight gold medals, will quarantine while awaiting results from a coronavirus test, the sprinter said in an Instagram post on Monday. We have updates and maps of the pandemic here. 5. TikTok sued the U.S. government. The video app, owned by the Chinese internet company ByteDance, accused the Trump administration of depriving it of due process when the president issued an executive order that will block the app from performing transactions in the U.S. The suit represents TikTok’s most direct challenge to the White House and comes amid souring relations between the U.S. and China. 6. Jerry Falwell Jr. resigned as president of Liberty University, one of the country’s largest Christian universities. Mr. Falwell, above, one of the most prominent evangelical supporters of President Trump, had been on leave since Aug. 7, after an uproar over a photograph he posted to Instagram that depicted him with his pants partly unzipped and his arm around a woman he later said was his wife’s assistant. Separately, the New York attorney general has asked a judge to order Eric Trump to testify under oath about the family business. 7. More than a million acres have burned in California. Clusters of wildfires continued to rage in Northern California on Monday, though there was some relief for firefighters: A turn in the weather did not deliver a feared barrage of new lightning strikes, like those that have sparked many of the hundreds of fires burning across the state. Firefighters have been scrambling to protect communities from two dozen major blazes, which have left at least seven people dead and dozens injured. More than 100,000 people have been driven from their homes. We have live updates here. Updated August 24, 2020 Also, Louisiana is bracing for two major storms less than 48 hours apart. Tropical Storm Marco will make landfall later Monday, followed by Laura on Wednesday. Follow the latest here. 8. Life online is a boon for the disabled. While many people have reported that remote work has improved their quality of life, they also say virtual socializing has been draining and disappointing. But for some of the 61 million Americans with disabilities, the ability to work, learn and socialize from home has unexpectedly expanded horizons. In April, Maria Sotnikova, above, attended her first Seder: a virtual dinner held over the videoconferencing app Webex. “I felt like I was getting to see something I should have been invited to all along, but wasn’t, because so few people’s homes are wheelchair accessible,” she said. Disabled people and advocates say they hope the inclusion will continue after things return to normal. The window is still open to make accessibility permanent, ideally under the guidance of people with disabilities. 9. Reimagining America’s monuments. Our T Magazine asked five artists to create monuments for America today, to envision memorials that embody this moment of reckoning with racism and social justice. The works or concepts they created range from the explicit — such as Ibrahim Mahama’s statue of Kwame Nkrumah, above, the first president of Ghana, on the campus of Nkrumah’s alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania — to the more theoretical, like Tourmaline’s plans to turn the Rikers Island penitentiary complex into a pleasure garden.
