By Adam Nossiter PARIS — France thought it had beaten the coronavirus. Its comeback in a roaring second wave left the government scrambling this week for a half-measure that underscored its ugly choices. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, highlighted his own dilemma on Wednesday in announcing a curfew for Paris and eight other major cities. A new lockdown for an already reeling economy would have been “disproportionate,” he said, yet the pressure on intensive care beds was intolerable. “Our caregivers are exhausted,” he said. “The virus is recirculating very rapidly in Europe and in our country,” Mr. Macron said in an interview on national television. France had to “take back control.” If the virus ever was under control in France, that was before the summer. But, experts say, after that moment, the French, like so many others elsewhere in Europe, let their guard down. France’s attachment to its summer holidays, young people’s exuberance in going out and partying, a lack of vigilance in wearing masks and social distancing, the risks of resuming routine life, and the government’s failure — from the very start — to effectively test, trace and isolate infected people have all contributed to an explosive second wave of infections. Whether ordering people, starting Saturday, to stay in their homes from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. is the answer — restaurant owners and young people are already grumbling — cannot be known immediately. But the dire outlook was undeniable. With an average of nearly 20,000 new cases a day, health experts have been warning all week that the virus is out of control in France, particularly in cities. “Right now, we’ve got to put the brakes on it,” said Yazdan Yazdanpanah, an infectious disease specialist on the French government’s Covid-19 advisory panel. “This curfew will limit contacts,” he said. “We’ve got to lower the rate right away. We don’t really have a choice.” Mircea Sofonea, an epidemiologist at the University of Montpellier, said that the new curfew came in “the last possible week to react” to prevent hospital saturation. He noted that a new study found that a curfew imposed in French Guiana reduced infections by 36 percent. Until Wednesday night, Mr. Macron’s own indecision had emphasized the quandary faced by governments all over Europe caught between faltering economies — France is facing a recession of nearly 9 percent — restriction-weary populations and a virus that will not quit. The government’s hesitancy was palpable this week. The prime minister, Jean Castex, chided the French for having “decided a little too quickly” that the virus no longer posed a threat. The same day, the tourism minister, Jean Baptiste Lemoyne, urged people to go on vacation during the upcoming school break, to prop up the country’s vital tourism industry, whose revenues are half what they were a year ago. Mr. Macron himself acknowledged the impossibility of barring upcoming French vacation-going in his remarks on Wednesday night. Lulled by a relatively successful handling of the first wave, the government failed to firmly put in place a critical triptych over the summer — testing, tracing and isolation. The numbers are not as high as they were last spring, but they are bad enough. Nearly 100 people died in the 24 hours ending Thursday morning, far below the 1,000-plus death tolls of mid-April but still alarming. Cases, flat through June and July, have been rising steadily since August, with 27,000 positive tests reported last Saturday. An infection rate of 5 to 6 cases per 100,000 people over the summer has spiraled to nearly 200 across France. It is up to 800 for 20- to 30-year-olds in Paris. The government has set the red alert limit at 150. In the interim, bars and gyms have been shut in major cities. Establishments that serve food remain open, even if cafe owners report confusion about what qualifies as enough of a meal to keep the police off their backs. There have been mixed messages, too, about going back to offices. The president of the region that includes Paris, Valérie Pécresse, appealed for a return last month, even as infections started to rise. The result is that central Paris bustles with office workers, compared with moribund downtowns in the United States, though nearly everybody wears a mask. On Wednesday, Mr. Macron encouraged at least a partial return to telecommuting.
