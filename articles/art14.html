By Mark Miller Paula Brynen has been finding a sense of purpose in volunteer work for years â€” and even more so after her job as a fund-raiser for public television in California was eliminated two years ago. Having survived leukemia in 2011, she volunteers with the local chapter of the nonprofit Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, work that has been especially important to her. Before the coronavirus pandemic, Ms. Brynen devoted 15 hours a month to the organization and to other causes, including arts groups and a volunteer recruitment clearinghouse. In March, the health risks of in-person contact brought all of her in-person volunteering to an abrupt halt, forcing her in new directions. Her volunteer work has become all virtual, but she finds herself devoting even more hours each month to her causes now.
