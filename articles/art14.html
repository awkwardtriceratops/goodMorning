Our Luck Just Ran Out.<br></h1><p id="artcont">The men and women of the military are essential workers, too. By Esau McCaulley Contributing Opinion Writer When I met the woman who would become my wife, it was 2001, we were in college, and she already knew that she wanted to join the military. The Navy would pay for her medical school, freeing her of debt. Military service was not a part of my plans, but love makes fools of us all. Since my wooing was already on shaky ground, I smiled and said, “That sounds great.” I knew then that if we started dating, I would be beginning a relationship with the military as well. We’ve been married 15 years. The first seven years of our marriage were taken up with active-duty service. About 16 percent of Naval officers are women, and about half of them are married. That has made me something of an anomaly: the male spouse of an officer. I remember showing up at the first “moms and tots” meeting with my son and thinking, “Well, this is awkward.” Still, we were lucky: My wife never deployed during her years of active duty. Despite three moves, our marriage remained strong. She then transitioned to the reserves, which took her away from me and our four children for a manageable one weekend per month and two weeks every summer. It took a pandemic for our luck to run out. A month ago, my wife came home from her time in the field with the dreaded news. As a part of dealing with the unexpected complexities of Covid-19, she, like many other reservist doctors, had been called up to active duty. She would soon have to depart for seven months. In a moment, our anniversary, the start of school, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Eve were all transformed.
