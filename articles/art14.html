By William Lamb and Nada Rashwan A Saudi court on Monday issued final verdicts in the killing of the dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi, months after one of his sons said he and his siblings had forgiven the men who killed him, effectively eliminating the possibility that the defendants would be executed. Saudi state television announced that five of the eight defendants had been sentenced to 20 years in prison each, and that two had been sentenced to 17 years each. One was issued a 10-year sentence. In December, a Saudi court sentenced five of the men to death, a punishment the kingdom usually carries out by beheading, in connection with the killing and dismemberment of Mr. Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Three defendants received prison terms. The trial, held in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, was shrouded in secrecy. The kingdom did not reveal the suspects’ names, and foreign diplomats who attended were sworn to silence. Human rights groups dismissed the outcome, saying the court was punishing low-level agents while protecting their leaders. Mr. Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi journalist, fled the kingdom during the rise of its powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and wrote critically about him as a columnist for The Washington Post.
