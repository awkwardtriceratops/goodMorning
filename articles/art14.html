By Azi Paybarah Four people died following a shooting involving the police on Tuesday morning in Henderson, Nev., law enforcement officials said. About 11 a.m. Tuesday, a dispatcher received a call about a possible shooting at an apartment complex on Stonelake Cove Avenue in Henderson, about 16 miles southeast of Las Vegas, officials said. The caller reported hearing what sounded like gunshots and seeing “someone with a possible gunshot wound in a nearby doorway,” Capt. Jason Kuzik of the Henderson Police Department said at a news conference later on Tuesday. When the police arrived, they found two people who had been shot and “a possible suspect in a parked car that was nearby,” Captain Kuzik said. Officers tried to contact this person and it “resulted in an officer-involved shooting,” he said. Asked for the condition of the officers involved in the episode, Captain Kuzik said, “I don’t have the information right now." A spokeswoman for the department later said no officers had been killed. The person in the vehicle was among the four people who were killed, Captain Kuzik said. A fifth was taken to the hospital, he said. At the news conference, Captain Kuzik said that identities of the people involved had not been confirmed. He said the police were still investigating the matter, including what had led to the initial shootings. The killings took place at a three-story building at an apartment complex, The Douglas at Stonelake, that one resident, Amber Belmonte, said was generally quiet. Ms. Belmonte, 38, said in a phone interview that she was looking out a window in her apartment on Tuesday morning when she noticed about a half-dozen police vehicles, with sirens blaring, racing into the complex. She went outside to see what was happening. “I started seeing assault rifles, bulletproof vests,” recalled Ms. Belmonte, an emergency medical technician who grew up in the city. She counted more than two dozen marked police vehicles — in addition to unmarked vehicles, SWAT cars, fire trucks and ambulances. That’s when a burst of gunfire rang out, she said. Ms. Belmonte ran back into her apartment. Generally, she said, life is uneventful at the apartment complex, which includes a heated outdoor pool, a bocce court and a hammock farm. “I imagined the only thing I was going to stress about was the election,” she said. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
