By Roger Cohen Opinion Columnist The ruler broods, alone with his rage and shame, undone by rejection, his mind, like Macbeth’s, “full of scorpions,” plotting to overturn facts and destroy American democracy. His lackeys, and only they remain, try to humor the master in his labyrinth. Donald Trump, departing president, lost in an election that a division of the Department of Homeland Security has now called “the most secure in American history,” with no “evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised.” Mr. President, get the boxes, get the tape, pack your bags and be gone. He can’t. He won’t. It’s not in the man. Truth is unbearable. Fraud! Rigged! Trump can no more accept defeat than recall the fact that he took an oath to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” His only vow is to preserve, protect and defend himself. He has never been able to see beyond that orange face in the mirror. No Bible offers consolation to this man, no creed, no truth, no sense of decency, not even Fox News now, nothing. With his victory in Arizona and Georgia confirmed, Joe Biden, the president-elect, has 306 electoral votes, 36 more than the 270 needed to take the White House. He will end up with about 80 million popular votes, the most any candidate has ever gotten, and over five million more than Trump. No recount can turn these numbers around. No evidence has emerged to back Trump’s lawsuits challenging the outcomes. Biden did not squeak this victory. He won clearly, period.
