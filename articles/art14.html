By John Koblin RIGHT NOW “Watchmen,” a take on the comic book series that addressed police brutality and white supremacy, won best limited series. It took several years for “Schitt’s Creek” to catch on. On Sunday, a few months after the last episode of its sixth and final season, the big-hearted Canadian comedy was the hit of the 72nd Emmy Awards. In a sweep, “Schitt’s Creek” won every comedy award handed out at the ceremony, including the top prize, best comedy. The show dominated the first hour of the Emmys broadcast, and its cast members got plenty of screen time as they celebrated during a viewing party in Toronto, not far from where they show is made. Daniel Levy, the 37-year-old writer, actor and director who created the show with his father, Eugene Levy, won four Emmys: for writing, directing, best supporting actor and for best comedy. “Oh no, oh no,” Levy said, as he accepted the Emmy for best supporting actor, his third of the night. “The internet’s about to turn on me. I’m so sorry.” The show’s stars — the longtime colleagues Catherine O’Hara and Eugene Levy — won best acting in a comedy honors for their husband-and-wife roles on the show.  The Emmy wins were their first since the early 1980s, when they were honored for their writing on the groundbreaking comedy series “SCTV.” O’Hara thanked the Levys for giving her the chance “to play a woman of a certain age — my age — who fully gets to be her ridiculous self.” To round it out for program’s fictional Rose family, Annie Murphy won for best supporting actress in a comedy, too. Daniel Levy’s four wins represented the biggest haul for anyone during the Emmys’ prime-time telecast, a spokesman for the Television Academy said. “Schitt’s Creek” airs on Pop TV in the United States and attracted new viewers after its past seasons started streaming on Netflix in recent years. “Watchmen,” an ambitious adaptation of a graphic novel from the veteran producer Damon Lindelof that addressed police brutality and white supremacy, won in the category of best limited series. Regina King, the show’s masked hero, won best actress in a limited series, her fourth Emmy win. In her acceptance speech, King implored viewers to vote in the coming election and paid tribute to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice who died Friday. She delivered her remarks while wearing a T-shirt that honored Breonna Taylor, a Black medical technician in Louisville, Ky., who was killed by police in March. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who portrays King’s husband on the show, won for best supporting actor in a limited series. And Lindelof and Cord Jefferson won for best writing in a limited series for their work on the series. It wasn’t a complete sweep for “Watchmen.” Uzo Aduba, who played Shirley Chisholm in “Mrs. America,” FX and Hulu’s chronicle of the feminist movement (and counter-movement) in the 1970s, won best supporting actress in a limited series. It was the third Emmy for Ms. Aduba. The 72nd Emmy Awards on Sunday at 8 p.m. Eastern time looked nothing like the earlier ceremonies celebrating the year’s achievements in television and streaming. Red carpet? Canceled. Actors seated shoulder to shoulder in an auditorium as the envelopes are unsealed? Nope. Jimmy Kimmel kicked off the ceremony from a nearly empty Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. “Welcome to the Pand-Emmys,” Kimmel said. In the opening moments, he appeared to deliver his jokes to a live audience — but it was just footage of crowds from past broadcasts that made it seem as if Oprah Winfrey, Michael Douglas and Jon Hamm were laughing at his remarks. Kimmel eventually gave up the bit to reveal that he was facing rows of empty seats, some of them filled with cardboard cutouts of television stars. “Of course we don’t have an audience,” Kimmel said. “This isn’t a MAGA rally.” More than 100 nominees watched his monologue — and would soon broadcast themselves — from locations ranging from Berlin to Fayetteville, Ga. (Some prominent nominees did not bother with it — Cate Blanchett, up for best actress in a limited series, skipped the virtual ceremony, as did Jeremy Irons who was up for best actor in a limited series). In an effort to make the broadcast go as smoothly as possible, the Television Academy sent a kit to each nominee with instructions on how to put together a D.I.Y. studio. It comes complete with a ring light, a microphone, a laptop and a camera. Several presenters and entertainers — including Jennifer Aniston, Tracee Ellis Ross and Jason Bateman — joined Kimmel on a stage built above the Staples Center basketball court. The show was moved from its usual spot, the Microsoft Theater, to the home of the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers, because the arena has the technological wherewithal to accommodate dozens of remote feeds. “We’ve all done some of the biggest award shows ever but none of us have done anything on this scale before,” said Reginald Hudlin, an executive producer. HBO’s operatic drama, “Succession,” is the favorite for the most prestigious award, best drama. This chronicle of a cutthroat clan won best drama honors at the Golden Globes and the Television Critics Association Awards earlier this year, and the show’s creator, Jesse Armstrong, won the Emmy for best drama writing in 2019. Other contenders have emerged to take the place of “Game of Thrones,” the HBO epic that won this category a record-tying four times. Netflix has a pair of possible winners in “The Crown” and “Ozark.” And don’t count out the Baby Yoda smash, “The Mandalorian.” The Disney+ action-adventure series won a number of technical Creative Arts Emmys, which were given out last week, and Television Academy voters do not scrunch their noses at mass entertainment. Olivia Colman, an Oscar and Golden Globe winner who plays the lead in Netflix’s “The Crown,” will face off against the four-time Emmy winner Laura Linney, a star of Netflix’s “Ozark,” in the best actress category. Other nominees include Jennifer Aniston (“The Morning Show”), last year’s best drama winner, Jodie Comer (“Killing Eve”), her castmate Sandra Oh, and last year’s breakout star, Zendaya (“Euphoria”). Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong, who portray the father and son of a feuding dynasty on “Succession,” will compete against each other in real life as the top contenders for best actor in a drama. If they split the vote, Jason Bateman, a star of “Ozark,” could be the beneficiary. Catherine O’Hara and Eugene Levy earned some Emmy love, winning in the lead acting comedy categories for their roles as the husband-and-wife duo in “Schitt’s Creek.” The two stars of the series have won Emmys before — but not since the early 1980s, when they were recognized as writers for the work on the groundbreaking Canadian comedy series “SCTV.” In fact, only a few series have ever swept best comedy and top acting honors in the same year, including “30 Rock,” (Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin) “All in the Family” (Carroll O’Connor, Jean Stapleton) and “The Dick Van Dyke Show” (Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore). </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
