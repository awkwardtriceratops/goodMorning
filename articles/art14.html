She gritted her teeth. Her adrenaline surged. She braced herself, gripped her rod tighter and started reeling, all while fighting the waves and current. After a few minutes of coaxing, she spotted rainbow scales glistening on a king mackerel as it neared the water’s surface. Captain David Stone hooked the hefty fish, plucking it from the ocean and plopping it onto the Cay Sea May’s deck. Cheers erupted. Peebles exhaled. “Look at him, he’s a fatty,” Tiana Davis said. “He is a fatty,” Bobbiette Palmer said. “That’s your name: Fatty.” Fatty mounted a final stand, furiously flopping. “Tell ’em what you’re talking about,” Lesleigh Mausi said. “Tell ’em why you’re mad.” Soon, the 26-foot boat raced back to shore with the group’s haul to be weighed in at Chasin’ Tails Outdoors Bait & Tackle.
