So why does it feel so different on the ground here? By Shawn McCreesh Mr. McCreesh is an editorial assistant for the Opinion section. BENSALEM, Pa. — Two men, one in a Ford F-150 truck bedecked with Trump decals and the other in a Chevrolet Malibu, were stopped at a traffic light, arguing about politics. The light turned green, the truck pulled into a parking lot and the Chevy followed. The man in the truck jumped out, brandishing a trailer hitch head like a war hammer. The parking lot led to the Trump Store, a tiny shop selling MAGA merchandise. It has turned the strip mall here in Bucks County, north of Philadelphia, into a never-ending Trump rally. This was Saturday afternoon. Less than an hour later, someone leaned out of the window of an S.U.V., punched a Trump Store customer in the face, and took off. “It feels like I’m surrounded by Trump people,” said Kendall Messick, 25, a warehouse worker for a phone company who was sitting in the passenger seat of the Chevy Malibu, which had moved to an adjacent lot when a store manager threatened to call the police as the argument escalated. “Look where you are,” said the car’s driver, Jamear Seals, 27, a Peloton employee. He gestured toward the growing group of Trump supporters with whom he had nearly come to blows. “You’re in a Philadelphia suburb.” This town and others like it will decide which way Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes will swing in next week’s election. President Trump won the state by less than one percentage point in 2016 and pretty much can’t eke out a victory again without it. “We win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing,” he said at a rally an hour from here on Monday. Saturday morning, before the contretemps at the Trump store, Joe Biden was just down the road, speaking at a community college. “It may come down to Pennsylvania,” he told the crowd.
