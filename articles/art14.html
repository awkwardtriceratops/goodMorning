Local Black activists planned an event nearby. By Mike Baker and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs PORTLAND, Ore. — Members of the right-wing Proud Boys and their supporters arrived in a Portland park on Saturday as leftist activists prepared their own counter-rallies, raising the temperature of a city already on edge as officials pleaded for the ralliers to refrain from violence. Gov. Kate Brown declared a state of emergency in advance of the arrival of the Proud Boys, an all-male group whose members — many of whom support President Trump — often engage in provocations, threats or fighting with opponents at their events. Ms. Brown’s declaration cleared the way for a major law enforcement presence in hopes of keeping the dueling groups apart, but there were fears that people traveling to the park with violent intentions would nonetheless find a way to sow chaos. Downtown Portland has been rocked by protests this summer, first over the police killings of Black people, and later over the Trump administration’s move to send federal agents to the city in an attempt to quell the demonstrations. And demonstrations across the United States kicked up again this week after a grand jury in Kentucky decided not to indict either of the two Louisville police officers who shot Breonna Taylor, a Black emergency room technician, in her own apartment. Protesters in Louisville faced off with the police again on Friday evening, with the police firing flash-bang grenades and arresting 22 people; more protests were planned for Saturday. In New York, hundreds of demonstrators held a sit-in for more than an hour on the Brooklyn Bridge, where many took a knee in honor of Ms. Taylor. People also took to the streets in Oakland, Seattle, Boston and Albuquerque, where a motorist reportedly tried to drive a car through the crowd, though no one was reported injured. In Portland, the Proud Boys have described the event on Saturday in the city's Delta Park as a rally to ”end domestic terrorism” that they say is being carried out in Portland and other cities by left-wing demonstrators, including supporters of antifa, the loose group of activists who sometimes use violence to stop people from promoting views they deem fascist or racist. But many in Portland see the event as a thinly veiled excuse by the right-wing group to brawl with their ideological opposites. Among the roughly 200 Proud Boys members who were gathered Saturday morning, hours before the main event, some were carrying guns. Others had bullet-proof vests and other tactical gear.
