Roberts Jr. said. By Christopher Mele Political leaders from both sides of the aisle and the chief justice of the United States offered tributes to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Friday, remembering her as a trailblazer and a warrior for justice. But their comments also reflected what is expected to be a bruising fight over her replacement. The chief justice, John G. Roberts Jr., said in a statement released by the court: “Our nation has lost a jurist of historic stature. We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague. Today we mourn but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her — a tireless and resolute champion of justice.” Hillary Clinton, who was the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee and whose husband, former President Bill Clinton, nominated the justice to the court, said on Twitter that Justice Ginsburg had “paved the way for so many women, including me.” “There will never be another like her,” she added. “Thank you RBG.” The sudden news of Justice Ginsburg’s death jolted the political world in Washington and reverberated far beyond, introducing the potential for a brutal and partisan nomination fight over the final stretch of the 2020 presidential campaign and a new layer of urgency surrounding whom voters will ultimately elect. Mr. Trump has long brandished his efforts to appoint Republican judges and remake the courts as a re-election argument to weary right-leaning voters, and he released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees this month.   Speaking briefly to reporters before boarding Air Force One on Friday night, Mr. Trump did not mention whether he would seek to fill Justice Ginsburg’s seat. “She just died?” Mr. Trump said. “I didn’t know that. She was an amazing woman — whether you agree or not — she was an amazing woman who led an amazing life.” And on Friday night, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said, “President Trump’s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.” Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, called Justice Ginsburg a “beloved figure” and said her seat should not be filled until after the presidential election. “There is no doubt, and let me be clear, that the voters should pick the president, and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider,” Mr. Biden told reporters after landing at New Castle Airport in Delaware following a campaign trip to Minnesota. Aware that Republicans are likely to seek to appoint a replacement for Justice Ginsburg, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, urged his Republican colleagues to exercise patience. “The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,” he said. “Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.” Senator Mazie Hirono, a Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she had a message for the president and for Mr. McConnell: “The best and only way to honor the life’s work of Justice Ginsburg, a giant of a jurist, is to honor her fervent final wish that she not be replaced until a new president is installed.” Republicans argued four years ago that a vacant Supreme Court seat should not be filled in an election year. Led by Mr. McConnell, they denied Judge Merrick B. Garland — President Barack Obama’s choice to fill a Supreme Court vacancy — a hearing in 2016 and successfully kept him off the court. In his statement on Friday, Mr. McConnell said: “Since the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite-party president’s Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year. By contrast, Americans re-elected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary. Once again, we will keep our promise.” Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican of Georgia, said on Twitter that the seat should be filled ahead of the election. “Our country’s future is at stake & @realDonaldTrump has every right to pick a new justice before the election,” she wrote. “I look forward to supporting a strict constructionist who will protect the right to life & safeguard our conservative values.” While the political jockeying geared up over what would happen next in filling the vacancy, other leaders offered accolades for the justice’s temperament and achievements. Mr. Clinton called her  “one of the most extraordinary justices ever to serve on the Supreme Court.” “Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s life and landmark opinions moved us closer to a more perfect union,” he wrote on Twitter. “And her powerful dissents reminded us that we walk away from our Constitution’s promise at our peril.”
