By Meredith Bethune Ms. Bethune is a food and travel writer originally from Newport, Rhode Island. On Tuesday night, I received a curious text while en route to my current home in Albany, N.Y., after a visit to my hometown. Embedded in the message was a thumbnail of a 30-second video clip. Against the backdrop of a beach in Warwick, a Rhode Island suburb about 20 minutes south of Providence, stood a mask-clad chef, silently holding a plate of fried squid and red cherry peppers. By his side stood the state Democratic Party chairman, Joseph M. McNamara. The clip had just aired on televisions across the country, leaving many Americans, including Rhode Islanders, scratching their heads. “That dude just called Rhode Island the ‘Calamari Comeback State,’” my friend’s text said. Eh? “My new home state of Rhode Island is trending over calamari and I have never been more hungry and confused at the same time,” tweeted one Rhode Islander. “It should be the clam cake comeback state,” I told my friend. Never heard of clam cakes? That’s because our savory fritters dotted with our iconic chopped quahogs are utterly unique to the Ocean State. On r/RhodeIsland, the Rhode Island subreddit, one poster suggested Mr. McNamara should have taken the chance to showcase “stuffies,” another particularly Rhode Island delicacy: hard shell clams stuffed with a mixture of breadcrumbs and spicy Portuguese sausage. Instead, we were informed that fried calamari served with garlic and cherry peppers or banana peppers — a staple of the Northeast, or basically anywhere with a large enough Italian-American population — was our official “state appetizer.” If I, and apparently many Rhode Islanders, were completely unaware of calamari’s government-designated status, we have an excuse — the crucial events leading up to this development occurred relatively recently. Back in 2014, State Representative McNamara and State Senator Susan Sosnowski submitted a bill to give fried squid the official state imprimatur, on the basis that Rhode Island is home to the largest squid-fishing fleet in the Northeast region. “Squid is to Rhode Island what lobster is to Maine and cod is to Massachusetts,” declared the bill, raising eyebrows across the state. According to The Daily Beast, while some Rhode Islanders were irritated that the legislature was spending valuable time debating the merits of seafood dishes at all, many others simply balked at the idea of elevating calamari over clams. Up until recently, I would have counted myself among them. I did not like calamari. I was a kid in 1996, when calamari peaked in popularity and became a staple of restaurant dining tables around the region. But it was particularly ubiquitous in Rhode Island: The country’s smallest state is also one of its most Italian, and nearly one in five Rhode Islanders claim Italian ancestry. This was mostly to my dismay. Because to a naïve kid, the crispy, golden halos looked enticing — like onion rings fresh from the fryer. Except when I held a piece to my mouth and bit into it, I encountered a rubbery mass instead. I never quite recovered from the bait and switch. I wrote off calamari for years, contenting myself with stuffies, clam cakes, chowder, and other quahog dishes; the clam’s mild brininess buried beneath dense fritter dough or creamy broth was much more amenable to my childhood palate. But the once mighty quahog industry, which has dominated Rhode Island seafood since the 1940s, has struggled recently: prices for clams have stagnated. At the same time, as the American palate has evolved, the demand for squid has increased. Today, Rhode Island’s squid industry — valued at about $18 million per year — is the biggest commercial fishery in the state and the most valuable squid fishery in the Northeast. “We have something that really distinguishes Rhode Island from every other state,” Mr. McNamara told The Associated Press in 2013. Sure, other Northeast states might have calamari — but do they have this much calamari? Still, like the rest of the country, Rhode Island, which struggled to recover from the 2008 recession, is facing a new set of challenges as a result of the pandemic. According to the Providence Journal, the fishing industry was walloped in March when the state shut down restaurants and many wholesalers stopped buying seafood altogether. In response, the state temporarily changed industry regulations and permitted fishermen to sell directly to consumers. Today “our state appetizer, calamari, is available in all 50 states,” Mr. McNamara proclaimed on Tuesday. It’s worth mentioning that Rhode Island’s, er, colorful political culture can be described as parochial at best, and incompetent/corrupt at worst. And at first glance, Mr. McNamara’s pet calamari cause might appear to be the latter. While other states were promoting local landmarks, or social causes, we were … peddling squid? Yes. Because besides being a brilliant viral marketing move, promoting squid’s official status on national television was a way for Rhode Island, so often ridiculed for its small stature and economic problems, to toot its own horn. It was a chance to tell the world what Rhode Islanders already know — the country’s tiniest state is home to a surprisingly varied and delicious food culture with an impressive number of local dishes. We have clam cakes and stuffies. We have johnnycakes, hot wieners, Del’s lemonade, and coffee milk. And now armed with newfound knowledge about squid’s economic importance, this Rhode Islander is ready to reconcile with calamari. And maybe even add it to the list.
