RIGHT NOW Fire officials fear that the possibility of more lightning strikes this weekend could ignite more fires, and that strong winds could spread the ones they are already battling. Firefighters are struggling to slow the spread of wildfires that have torched nearly 1 million acres in California and are growing further, forcing more than 119,000 people from their homes and testing the state’s firefighting abilities. There are 13,700 firefighters currently battling the blazes, but they are up against an extraordinary foe: Two groups of wildfires have swelled to become the second- and third-largest blazes the state has seen, and they are still growing. Those are among two dozen major fires pulling firefighters in all directions, forcing Gov. Gavin Newsom to request more firefighters from as far away as the East Coast and Australia. It may get worse. Fire officials are worried that another extreme period of lightning strikes — like the 12,000 strikes that are blamed for igniting many of the 585 new fires since last weekend — could roll through Northern California on Sunday and into the coming week, potentially bringing new blazes to an already-burning region. The fires have already burned through an area of land larger than Rhode Island. Maps showing the extents of the major fires in Northern California. The group of fires known as the L.N.U. Lightning Complex in Napa Valley — the second-largest in California history — has burned through 314,207 acres and consumed 560 homes and other buildings. Cal Fire, the state’s firefighting agency, said that group of fires was its top priority, but in a sign of how stretched the agency is, only 1,400 firefighters were assigned to battle it Saturday afternoon, fire officials said, and it was 15 percent contained. Chief Sean Kavanaugh, the incident commander, said about 5,000 firefighters were assigned to the Mendocino Complex fire in 2018, the largest fire recorded in the state. The C.Z.U. Lightning Complex north of Santa Cruz has led fire officials to order 77,000 people in San Mateo and Santa Cruz Counties to evacuate, including the entire University of California, Santa Cruz, campus. That group of fires has grown to 63,000 acres, consumed almost 100 buildings and is 5 percent contained. East of Silicon Valley, the S.C.U. Lightning Complex group of about 20 fires — largely burning in less-populated areas — has grown to 291,968 acres and is now the third-largest in state history. It is 10 percent contained. And many other fires are burning dangerously across the state. Two firefighters in Marin County had to call for a helicopter rescue after they were surrounded by the Woodward Fire, which is burning in a remote part of the Point Reyes National Seashore, north of San Francisco.
