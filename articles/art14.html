By Luis Ferré-Sadurní and Jesse McKinley Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Tuesday imposed tough new restrictions and guidelines aimed at curbing a surge of coronavirus clusters in parts of New York City and its northern suburbs. Under the new criteria, Mr. Cuomo said nonessential businesses — including restaurants, bars and gyms — would close in certain portions of Brooklyn and Queens and in New York City suburbs where the rate of new cases has remained stubbornly high for the past few weeks. Mr. Cuomo, who on Monday closed schools in the city’s hot spots, said that schools in parts of Rockland and Orange Counties would also close. The governor said mass gatherings would be prohibited in certain areas where there are virus clusters, and limits on capacity would be strengthened in houses of worship. The new rules, which will be in place for at least two weeks, may go into effect as soon as Wednesday, but no later than Friday, Mr. Cuomo said. “A mass gathering causes infections, infections cause a cluster, a cluster causes community spread,” said Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat. “That is the national evolution of things unless we intervene and we stop the cycle.” The governor’s actions on Tuesday came a day after he and Mayor Bill de Blasio offered mixed messages on the approach to managing the outbreak in parts of Brooklyn and Queens with large communities of Orthodox Jews, who officials say have openly flouted mask-wearing rules and limits on mass gatherings. The fresh set of lockdown measures are a somber setback for New York, once the epicenter of the pandemic. Officials had managed to keep the virus in check over the summer, but only after it had led to the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
