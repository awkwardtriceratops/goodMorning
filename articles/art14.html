Now Cases Are Inching Up Again.<br></h1><p id="artcont">The Northeast, devastated by the coronavirus in the spring and held up as a model of infection control by summer, is now seeing early signs of a second wave. By Sarah Mervosh and Julie Bosman In Boston, plans to bring children back to school have been halted as cases of the coronavirus climbed precariously. New virus clusters are emerging in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland and Pennsylvania. In New York City, the number of new cases each day now averages more than 500 for the first time since June. The Northeast, devastated by the coronavirus in the spring and then held up as a model of infection control by summer, is now seeing the first inklings of what might become a second wave of the virus, an ominous prospect for the region and a sharp warning to the rest of the country. The rise in new cases has prompted state and local officials to reverse course, tightening restrictions on businesses, schools and outdoor spaces. In New Jersey, where hospitalizations are on the rise and the rate of infection has almost doubled to nearly eight cases per 100,000 people, towns have closed public parks and picnic areas to discourage people from gathering. Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island extended restaurant capacity limitations for another month, concerned about the state’s uptick in confirmed cases. On Thursday, several mayors from across New York State rushed to quarantine after appearing at a news conference with another mayor who only later discovered that he was infected with the coronavirus. Michael Osterholm, an infectious-diseases expert at the University of Minnesota, said that early in the nation’s outbreak, New York and much of the Northeast had successfully tamped down transmission of the virus with physical distancing and masking, as much of Europe had done. “The point is, once you let up on the brake, then eventually, slowly, it comes back,” Dr. Osterholm said. By many measures, the Northeast continues to do quite well, particularly compared to current hot spots for the virus, including the Midwest and Great Plains. Since the spring, case numbers in the Northeast have plummeted over all. The region, which runs from Maine to Pennsylvania, is averaging about 60 deaths per day, the lowest in the nation, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Some 2,800 people are in a hospital in the region, accounting for 8 percent of the hospitalizations nationwide. Those figures are tiny compared with the spring, when tens of thousands of people in the Northeast were hospitalized on any given day, and morgues were running out of body bags.
