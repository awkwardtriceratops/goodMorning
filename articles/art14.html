By Gail Collins Opinion Columnist Things we would currently be better off without: People who ride bikes on the sidewalk Robocalls Third parties I know, I raised the bar a little at the end. Just trying to sneak us into a discussion of a critical part of our presidential elections that almost no one can stand to talk about. There’ll be quite a few third-party candidates floating around on our ballots this year. Some are doing fine things on the state and local levels, but avoid the ones who want to run the country. Most of them are feeding off a neither-candidate-is-good-enough syndrome that makes people vote for mystery men and women who come attached to a nice-sounding party label. It makes you feel superior — you’re a voter who won’t just settle. Real-world elections require you to look over a list of deeply imperfect candidates and pick the ones whose priorities are closest to yours. It’s not like getting married. There’s really no option for hanging onto your ballot until a better person comes along. Throwing your support to a third-party candidate with no hope whatsoever of getting elected is, however, a good way to dodge responsibility. Imagine you’re a well-known Republican like Mitt Romney or John Bolton. You want to get off the Trump bandwagon without looking like a friend to Democrats. So you announce you’ll be writing in the name of your mother-in-law or pet hamster. In Maine, Republican Senator Susan Collins won’t say who she’s voting for: “I don’t think that the people of Maine need my advice on whom to support for president.” Now this is probably very true, but the point was to evaluate the senator’s judgment, not get her directions to take to the polls. Collins is having a tough time right now. She’s running for re-election against Sara Gideon, the Democratic speaker of the State House of Representatives, in one of the year’s most important Senate races. This could be the one that determines whether we’ll be spending 2021 in the thrall of Mitch McConnell, so attention must be paid. They had a debate the other night, but I’ll bet a lot of the viewers walked away talking about Max Linn, an independent candidate who has no chance of being elected to anything whatsoever. Linn continually announced, “I’ve got to be way outside the box!” He also shouted “Request denied!” whenever the moderators tried to get him to answer their questions. It did make for more excitement than your average Senate debate, but really, if Maine voters wanted to be entertained, they’d have been watching “Raised by Wolves” on HBO.
