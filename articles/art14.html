Mayor<br></h1><p id="artcont">Mr. Johnson, the City Council speaker, was one of the front-runners to succeed Mayor Bill de Blasio, but the recent rigors of his job had worn on him. By Jeffery C. Mays Corey Johnson, the New York City Council speaker and a presumed front-runner in the 2021 contest to replace Mayor Bill de Blasio, withdrew from the race on Thursday. Mr. Johnson, who was expected to announce his decision on Thursday afternoon, had been grappling for weeks about whether to continue his candidacy. “I have made the difficult decision not to run,” Mr. Johnson said in a statement. “This challenging time has led me to rethink how I can best be of service to this city, and I have come to the conclusion that this is not the right path for me.” The exit of Mr. Johnson, a Democrat, is a reflection of how the country’s largest city has drastically changed in just six months, with its economic, social and political landscape reshaped by the coronavirus pandemic and the George Floyd protests. No one really knows when or how New York City, which has so many offices, restaurants and businesses still empty, will fully return to its paces, or whether people will feel comfortable on crowded subway trains or sidewalks. What seems clearer is that formidable challenges await whoever becomes the city’s next mayor. A severe drop-off in tax revenue, for example, is expected to create annual budget gaps of at least $5 billion starting with the next fiscal year. The social unrest that accompanied the Floyd protests led the city earlier this summer to cut the police budget and shift funds away from the department, but the reductions did not amount to the $1 billion cut that protesters had sought. The pressure to de-emphasize or defund the police is expected to mount in the coming months. The fight over police funding took a toll on Mr. Johnson, who had pledged to cut $1 billion from the police budget. But by late June, it became clear that divisions on the Council would make it impossible to do so, leaving Mr. Johnson apologetic and near tears. Mr. Johnson, 38, is prevented from seeking a third consecutive term on the City Council because of term-limit laws. He has not ruled out a future run for another office such as Congress. “I want to be clear that my decision to end this campaign is not the end of my public life,” Mr. Johnson said in his statement. “I will continue serving as speaker of the City Council and working to improve the lives of New Yorkers. I love this city with all my heart and I believe by working together, we will come back stronger than ever.”
