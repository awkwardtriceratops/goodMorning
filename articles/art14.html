By Julfikar Ali Manik and Maria Abi-Habib An explosion on Friday night at a mosque near Bangladeshâ€™s capital, believed to have been caused by a gas leak, killed at least 16 worshipers and left 21 with burns so severe that the death toll could rise further, according to a police officer and a doctor treating some of the victims. Gas from an underground pipeline may have leaked into the Baitus Salat Jame mosque in Narayanganj, just outside Dhaka. The mosque had been experiencing power outages and as the electricity surged back on, sparks from air conditioning units may have ignited fumes.
