To the Editor: Re “Trump Won’t Commit to Peaceful Transfer of Power” (news article, Sept. 24): Over the last four years, Donald Trump has redrawn the lines of decency, statesmanship and altruism so that now the page is blank, devoid of moral red lines that shouldn’t be crossed. He is pushing us to the brink by deliberately declaring: “There won’t be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation.” Listen to him! Defy him! He is testing America’s response. If there isn’t a loud mass response decrying his willful rejection of the Constitution and our legal voting rights, we give him the go-ahead to carry out his plan. This is the time to protest, to yell “not on our watch,” for newspaper headlines to shriek about the danger, for us to get out in the streets and stop him and his accomplices. This is not the time to politely urge the better angels of Republican senators to show themselves. They tore off their angel wings four years ago. Rage now, or it will be too late! Shelley Binder
New York To the Editor: Donald Trump once again refuses to commit to our democratic election process as, for example, he dismisses ballots, strangles the post office and stokes white supremacist violence. He continues to fuel Covid-19 deaths by arguing from his bully pulpit against what scientists and governments worldwide recommend. No one or nothing has stopped him from tearing apart our democracy and national security. With unrelenting lies and lawbreaking, he makes the Justice Department and other agencies his own. He puts our national security at risk interacting with Vladimir Putin, cuddling up to other dictators, breaking alliances, and denigrating our military and entities designed to protect us. Where is the leadership wall to stop assaults against the national health and welfare? Many people and groups have spoken out. Retired generals (trained for leadership) could create a coalition of Vote Vets. Republicans for Biden and nonpartisan groups promoting democracy could press the president to resign, since he won’t accept an election loss.
