By Jamelle Bouie Opinion Columnist The past isn’t a road map to the present — or even a travel guide — but there’s tremendous value in knowing how our predecessors tackled the challenges of their era. The period of the early American republic, in particular, was a fierce and fractious time in our political history, with highly charged debates over the very foundation of self-rule and constitutional government. Over the last week, I’ve written about the judicial battles of Thomas Jefferson’s first term and the constitutional conflict behind the Missouri controversy of 1819 to 1821. To conclude this brief cycle of columns, I want to take a look at the first and most consequential electoral crisis in American history: the election of 1800. On Dec. 3 of that year, the 138 members of the Electoral College gathered in their respective states to choose between Thomas Jefferson and the incumbent John Adams for president of the United States. The last two years had been among the most tumultuous in the life of the young nation. Rising tensions with France brought paranoia, anti-French feeling and fears of armed conflict. It was against this backdrop, in 1798, that President Adams and the Federalist Party turned their eyes toward their Democratic-Republican critics in the press. Faced with public contempt and slander in a society where politics were still personal and where, the historian Gordon S. Wood notes, “the honor and reputation of the political leaders seemed essential to social order and stability,” a Federalist-led Congress passed the Sedition Act, criminalizing opposition in the name of fighting French Jacobin subversion. “I cannot but be of the opinion,” Adams wrote a month after the signing the bill, “that the profligate spirit of falsehood and malignity are serious evils, and bear a threatening aspect upon the Union of the States, their Constitution of Government, and the moral character of the Nation.” The Sedition Act came on the heels of the Alien Friends Act, the Alien Enemies Act and the Naturalization Act, all of which were aimed at a purported French revolutionary conspiracy to organize, as the Federalist congressman Harrison Gray Otis of Massachusetts said, “bands of aliens as well as their own citizens, in other countries, to bring about their nefarious purposes.” The Friends Act, in particular, gave the president the power to expel, without due process, any “alien” judged “dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States.” To save the nation, Federalists would wield the state against foreign outsiders and domestic opponents, lest they poison the republic with their radicalism. The Democratic-Republicans were appalled. Jefferson, then vice president, believed the federal government under Adams had become “more arbitrary and has swallowed more of the public liberty than even that of England.” The Federalists, he said, had begun an “experiment on the American mind to see how far it will bear an avowed violation of the Constitution.”
