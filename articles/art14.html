Week 4<br></h1><p id="artcont">Even as the league scrambles to deal with an outbreak among the Tennessee Titans and Cam Newton’s positive Covid-19 test delaying the Patriots-Chiefs matchup, football’s schedule rumbles on. By Benjamin Hoffman RIGHT NOW New England Patriots vs. Kansas City Chiefs rescheduled for Monday Night. The idea of “tests” in the N.F.L. is usually a figurative one — how will Team X respond to the test of So-and-So’s defense? Until this week, pro football had been blissfully unencumbered by the scrambling and rescheduling to deal with positive coronavirus tests that other leagues have dealt with. But in the wake of an outbreak among the Tennessee Titans organization, where upward of 12 members of personnel — including at least 9 players — returned positive tests, and Saturday’s news that Patriots quarterback Cam Newton and Jordan Ta’amu, a quarterback on the Chiefs practice squad, were added to their teams’ reserve/Covid-19 lists, the league has been busy remaking the schedule, testing players known to have been in contact with infected parties, and rethinking how it polices its coronavirus health protocols. The Patriots-Chiefs game, originally scheduled for Sunday reportedly will be contested Monday night at 7:05 p.m., pushing back kickoff of the Falcons-Packers meeting to 8:50 p.m. Eastern. The Titans, who were supposed to face the Steelers this week, will instead take on Pittsburgh on Oct. 25. Despite the highly anticipated Cam Newton vs. Patrick Mahomes matchup being delayed, much of the N.F.L.’s Week 4 slate will go on, as scheduled. After Saints fullback Michael Burton tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday, his re-test and a rapid test reportedly came back negative, keeping the New Orleans-Detroit game on pace to play. Elsewhere, the league’s unbeatens will try to stick with what’s working. With Tennessee and Pittsburgh inadvertently idle, Green Bay playing on Monday and Kansas City having to wait for their game until Monday or Tuesday, just three teams have a shot at improving to 4-0 on Sunday. Here is a ranking of the likelihood that each of them gets there. 1. Seattle — The Seahawks are setting N.F.L. records on offense, and doing absolutely nothing to help on defense. It’s an issue as far as the team’s Super Bowl prospects, but it is unlikely to matter against Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Miami Dolphins (1-2), even on the road. 2. Buffalo — The Bills have a lot to work out before they can truly be considered a contender, but quarterback Josh Allen is loving life with wide receiver Stefon Diggs. That dynamic duo gives the team a solid shot at victory in a road game against the Las Vegas Raiders (2-1), but Buffalo’s defense will need to play far better than it has this season if they want to continue their winning streak. 3. Chicago — There is no reasonable explanation for the Bears being 3-0 other than luck. The team’s defense is not terrible, but it’s hardly good enough to make up for an offense in such turmoil that they had a quarterback controversy without ever losing a game. Now, with Nick Foles set as the starter, they are hosting the 2-1 Indianapolis Colts, and while anything is possible, Chicago won’t want to bank on the Colts simply handing them a victory like Detroit and Atlanta did. A road game against the Dallas Cowboys (1-2) is a fairly stiff test, but the Cleveland Browns would come away with something sensational if they were able to win: a 3-1 record for the first time since 2001 and just the second time since the franchise was resurrected in 1999. If they make it through this week unscathed, the Browns would then host Indianapolis in Week 5 with a chance at 4-1. They have not started that well since the 1994, when their 4-1 start turned into an 11-5 finish and a wild-card round win over New England — the last playoff win in franchise history. The best Browns start, however, came in 1948, when Otto Graham led them to a 14-0 regular season and the A.A.F.C. championship. With no new positive coronavirus tests among the New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs, the N.F.L. announced that their game – scheduled for Sunday afternoon – will be played Monday night at Arrowhead Stadium. The game will start at 7:05 p.m. Eastern time, and to accommodate that change, the league pushed back the Monday Night Football matchup between Atlanta and Green Bay to 8:50 p.m. The league on Saturday postponed the Chiefs-Patriots game after two players — New England quarterback Cam Newton and the Kansas City practice-squad quarterback Jordan Ta’amu — tested positive, delaying one of the early season’s more intriguing games and casting doubt upon the N.F.L.’s ability to contest a full season. Additional testing of players and employees conducted Saturday and Sunday revealed no new positive tests, giving the N.F.L. confidence that the game could be played this week. The N.F.L. said that Kansas City and New England worked with the players’ union and infectious disease experts to conduct contact tracing, though it is still possible, given the incubation period of the virus, that other positive tests emerge. The Tennessee Titans, fighting to contain an outbreak within their organization that is known to have infected 20 members, have had players or personnel test positive for six consecutive days, causing their scheduled Week 4 game against Pittsburgh to be postponed and imperiling their next game, at home Buffalo on Oct. 11. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
