Republicans have lost the suburbs only three times since 1980, but their dominance this year is far from certain. Supported by A photographer visited neighborhoods in Midwest battlegrounds to see how politics have intruded on tranquillity. Photographs and Text by Ruth Fremson Children are romping on playgrounds and riding bikes along tree-lined streets.  The backyards are big enough for barbecues with the neighbors and the public schools are quality. Life is typically slower and gentler in the suburbs, away from the ruckus of dense urban areas.

Lawns are packed with campaign signs, leaving no doubt where residents stand in the presidential contest. Traveling through hundreds of miles of suburbs in the Midwest battlegrounds of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and western Pennsylvania, I could clearly see this transformation.

Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, are more a period than an exclamation point on his supportersâ€™ determination to turn the tide in November.
