By Jill Cowan Good morning. On Monday, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s officials said deputies tried to stop a Black man who was riding a bike in South Los Angeles. They said he was stopped for a code violation related to the bike, but wouldn’t elaborate on what the alleged violation was. The man, Dijon Kizzee, 29, fled. Deputies chased him, eventually catching up. Sheriff’s officials said Mr. Kizzee punched one of the officers in the face and dropped a bundle that they said contained a handgun. When Mr. Kizzee dropped the bundle and “made a motion” toward the gun, officials said, the deputies opened fire. Mr. Kizzee died.

According to The Los Angeles Times, his family planned to conduct an independent autopsy. The shooting comes amid a continuing outcry across the country about racist police violence and took place not far from where Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies shot Andres Guardado, an 18-year-old Latino man, five times in the back in July. But while many California leaders have expressed support for the demonstrations and have vowed reforms, many stalled in the Legislature, including one high-profile proposal that would have, among other things, stripped badges from officers who break the law. California lawmakers skidded to the chaotic close of a legislative session in which sweeping policy debates often took a back seat to more immediate crises wrought by the pandemic.
