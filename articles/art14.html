He whispers a few kind words into his ear, congratulating his player on a fine afternoon’s work. Rodríguez smiles, thanking him, and then continues toward the bench. As Rodríguez reaches down to select a water bottle, Ancelotti turns away from the game and gently places a hand on the player’s back. It is an almost paternal gesture, full of satisfaction and pride and affection. He leaves it there for a second or two: just long enough for Rodríguez to know that he is appreciated. In the game’s afterglow — Everton has beaten West Bromwich Albion, 5-2, and will sit top of the nascent Premier League table for a few hours — Ancelotti is in a relaxed, contented mood, given to the warm nostalgia of the elder statesman, his mind fusing this happy afternoon to all of the heady days he has known. As he conducts his news media conference on Zoom, though, the focus is not on the rich promise of Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has scored a clinical, instinctive hat trick. The first few questions are Rodríguez, Rodríguez, Rodríguez. Ancelotti indulges them all with the air of a man expecting it. The last few weeks at Everton have all been about Rodríguez. His face adorns the program before his home debut. Outside Goodison Park, all three of the club’s summer signings — Allan, Abdoulaye Doucouré and Rodríguez — have been emblazoned on a billboard. But it is the Colombian, Rodriguez, who is front and center. On the day he signed, Everton arranged for the Colpatria Tower, Colombia’s tallest building, to be bathed in blue light. There were displays in New York’s Times Square and in Miami Beach, too. Richard Kenyon, the club’s director of marketing, said Rodríguez’s profile — he has, by the club’s estimate, the eighth largest social media following of any athlete on the planet — would help Everton fulfill its “global ambitions more quickly.” No player, the cliché runs, is ever bigger than a club. That is true, of course, but there are times when it feels more tenuous, when it is almost possible to believe it is not. The arrival of Rodríguez, Colombia’s golden boy, a bona fide Galactico, the star of the 2014 World Cup, at Everton — a team tired of treading water, desperate for something more than nostalgia — is one of those moments. At the turn of the year, rumors started to swirl in Spain that Barcelona — in dire need of attacking reinforcements as its season listed and turned — had approached Everton to see if the team would consider parting with its Brazilian forward Richarlison. He had cost $40 million when he arrived from Watford 18 months earlier, and his return had been steady: 13 Premier League goals in an encouraging debut season, with eight more halfway through his second. That was enough, several outlets reported at the time, to persuade Barcelona to offer to buy him for $108 million: an eyebrow-raising price, and a mouthwatering profit. Everton, the story went, had said no: the club had no intention of parting with a prized asset. A few weeks later, Richarlison himself would insist it was all smoke and vapor. Inundated with messages from friends in Brazil, he said, he had checked with his agent. There had been no offer, no confirmed interest. As ever in the transfer market, though, what was true mattered less than what stuck. To Everton fans, the club had taken a stand that it would not be bullied by the game’s superpowers, that — at last — it had the financial firepower and the concrete sense of purpose not to be used as a steppingstone. In a different light, though, Everton’s decision appeared far riskier. Most clubs of Everton’s profile — not part of the established, 21st century elite, but determined to rectify that — now actively advertise themselves as springboards. Young, gifted players arrive, excel, and are then sold on to one of the handful of destination teams in Europe: Barcelona, Real Madrid, Paris St.-Germain, Bayern Munich, Juventus and sundry members of England’s Big Six. When executed well, everyone benefits from this arrangement. The player has the stage on which to advertise his talents, a chance to build a data set. The club has access to a higher caliber of player — albeit in his formative years — than might otherwise be possible and, when a sale eventually goes through, can reinvest that money in its squad. It is the strategy that has allowed the likes of Monaco, Ajax, RB Leipzig and Lyon to reach the Champions League semifinals in recent years. It is the strategy that turned Tottenham into Premier League contenders for a couple of seasons and Atlético Madrid into a European force. To some extent — though the citation would not be welcomed at Everton — it is the approach that transformed Liverpool into English and European champions. It is, now, almost an orthodoxy that this is how all but a handful of clubs should operate. Signing Rodríguez at 29 runs contrary to that practice. Though Rodríguez’s case is a curious one, tangled up in the occasionally opaque world of Real Madrid’s inner logic, it is counterintuitive to try to catch up to the elite by signing players deemed not good enough to play for them.
