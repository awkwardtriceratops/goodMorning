No ballots were damaged and polls will open, officials say. By Marie Tae McDermott Good morning. The Blue Ridge and Silverado Fires that began this week in Orange County caused tens of thousands of residents to flee their homes and gravely injured two firefighters. Evacuation orders were lifted on Thursday and the blazes are both over 30 percent contained, according to CalFire. Vote centers will be open for in-person voting starting on Friday morning. I spoke with Neal Kelley, chief election official for Orange County, about how voting has been affected by the two large active fires. Have any ballots been damaged by the fires? No. Mr. Kelley said the ballot boxes that were closed because they were in evacuation zones were later cleared out. “I had to go in with sheriff’s department escorts to be able to retrieve the ballots that were in there,” he told me. “We were able to get them out safely.” Although the boxes were not completely unscathed, they are made out of solid steel and were able to resist high temperatures. Have some ballot drop-off locations closed? Ballot drop boxes have played a huge role in the elections this year. According to Mr. Kelley, over 700,000 ballots have already been returned with equal amounts of people using drop boxes and the Postal Service. “Voters are embracing our secure drop boxes and using them in huge amounts,” he said. Earlier this week, the authorities had to close four boxes, which were in evacuation zones. But as of Thursday, all of them have since been reopened as evacuation orders lifted. You can go to the county’s voting website to look for drop-off locations. Have some vote centers closed? As fires came dangerously close to residential communities, officials closed two vote centers, Foothill Ranch Library in Irvine and the Library of the Canyons in Silverado Canyon. Both will be open to receive voters on Friday morning. Through California’s Voter’s Choice Act model, Orange County residents aren’t tied to a particular voting location. They can cast their ballots at any vote center in the county. Can you still vote if you left your mail-in ballot at home when you evacuated? Voters who might have fled their homes without their mail-in ballots can still vote without them. “They can come to one of our vote centers and we can print them a replacement vote-by-mail ballot if that’s what they choose to use,” Mr. Kelley said. “If you don’t want to use your vote-by-mail ballot, we’ll get you a ballot on demand and allow you to vote in person.”
