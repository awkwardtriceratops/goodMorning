By Tracey Tully Just a few weeks ago it seemed that New Jersey, the state with the highest coronavirus death rate in the nation, was on the verge of reaching a crucial milestone. After cutting the rate of transmission to one of the lowest levels in the country, the state was preparing to reopen all its schools for in-person instruction. Then Gov. Philip D. Murphy gave districts the option to open remotely — and things began to fall apart. Districts that educate the state’s poorest children, including most of the large city school systems, were the first to pull the plug on face-to-face instruction. Now, with less than two weeks before the start of school, growing numbers of affluent districts are following suit, citing teacher shortages, ventilation issues, and late-in-the-game guidance from the state on how to manage virus cases. The frenzy of last-minute decision-making underscores the extreme challenge of reopening schools, not only in the United States, but worldwide, as shown by an outbreak in Israel after it was one of the first countries to bring students back into class. On Wednesday, the superintendent of a regional district in Monmouth County, N.J., criticized Mr. Murphy’s fluctuating reopening strategy — what he called a “haphazard approach” — as he announced that schools would not reopen in spite of a summer-long effort to make that possible. “He opened the door to a cascading series of events that placed intense staffing pressures on schools committed to opening,” the superintendent of Freehold Regional High School District, Charles B. Sampson, wrote in a letter to parents explaining the abrupt shift. “This poorly developed plan has had the distinct impact of forcing many districts to adopt a remote option regardless of community sentiment.” A week earlier, the school district in Millburn, one of the state’s most affluent townships, cited the 79 staff members who had asked for waivers from in-person instruction as a key reason it was abandoning its ambitious reopening plan and switching to all-remote instruction. The district in Livingston, the town next door, pointed to a domino effect that was leading to an insurmountable shortage of teachers. “Multiple neighboring districts have announced that they will open the school year with remote learning,” Livingston’s superintendent, Matthew J. Block, wrote in a letter announcing all-remote instruction. “This trend has led to an increase in the number of our staff who are requesting child care leaves.” Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, has said that a one-size-fits-all solution was impractical and that the state’s nearly 600 public districts needed flexibility to meet unique needs. New York State has taken a similar approach to reopening, permitting schools in Yonkers and Buffalo to open remotely, even as New York City still plans to bring students into class part time. A vast majority of New Jersey’s districts are still moving ahead with plans for face-to-face instruction, said Mahen Gunaratna, a spokesman for Mr. Murphy. Sixty-six are even fully reopening to all students every day of the week. “The Murphy administration has outlined clear public health and safety standards for school reopenings based on guidance from public health experts, while providing options for our nearly 600 school districts to craft plans that meet this guidance based on the needs of their individual school communities,” Mr. Gunaratna said in a statement.
