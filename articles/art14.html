Approval<br></h1><p id="artcont">The agency said it had issued a certificate clearing the way for the company to use drones to fly packages to its customers’ doorsteps. By Concepción de León Amazon has received federal approval to use drones to deliver packages, bringing the retailer a critical step closer to its goal of shortening delivery times to 30 minutes or less. The Federal Aviation Administration said Monday that it had issued a Part 135 air carrier certificate to Amazon for its fleet of Prime Air drones. Amazon did not say when customers could expect drones to drop packages at their doorsteps. Obtaining the F.A.A. certificate was an “important step,” the company said, adding that it would continue to test the technology, which has been in development for years. The company said it was required to submit evidence of the safety of its operations, and to demonstrate those operations for the agency. David Carbon, the vice president of Prime Air, said in a statement that the certification “indicates the F.A.A.’s confidence in Amazon’s operating and safety procedures for an autonomous drone delivery service that will one day deliver around the world.” He added that the company would “continue to develop and refine our technology to fully integrate delivery drones into the airspace, and work closely with the F.A.A. and other regulators around the world to realize our vision of 30-minute delivery.”
