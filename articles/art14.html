By John Eligon, Julie Bosman and Peter Baker KENOSHA, Wis. — President Trump ventured into ground zero of the nation’s roiling debate over race and justice on Tuesday to stand in defense of the police and to reject calls for changes in law enforcement that have generated months of social unrest across the United States. Traveling to Kenosha, Wis., over the objections of the governor and mayor who feared his presence would further inflame tensions, Mr. Trump offered support to law enforcement officers and toured shops damaged by rioting that followed last week’s shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man who was struck seven times in the back by a white police officer. Mr. Trump never mentioned Mr. Blake’s name nor spoke with his family, brushing past the shooting and calling attention instead to the street violence that he blamed on liberal politicians. He expressed more empathy for police officers, saying that they have a “tough job” and that occasionally some simply “choke” when put under “tremendous pressure” in carrying out their duties. “It’s a dangerous job,” Mr. Trump told several law enforcement officials and Republican politicians at a high school in Kenosha. “But I have to say this to the police: The people of our country love you.” Much of the small city shut down in anticipation of the president’s visit, with roads closed, commuter trains suspended, helicopters buzzing overhead and armored cars deployed in the streets. The calm was broken when woman in a pro-Trump hat and a man who said he was a member of the Proud Boys, a far-right group known for inciting violence at protests, showed up at a park that has been a hub for rallies since Mr. Blake’s shooting. As the police scrambled to separate the two from about 100 protesters shouting at them, an officer sprayed a chemical agent in the eyes of a documentary filmmaker. The filmmaker, Ashley Dorelus, who is Black, said the officer, who is white, had touched her breast as he was pushing protesters away, and she swiped at his hand, after which the officer sprayed her. “I said, ‘Don’t touch me,’ so he took his pepper spray and sprayed me in the face,” she said, adding that her eyes were still burning. “I should not be subjected to this.” Kenosha has become the latest focal point of anger over police shootings of Black Americans and the eruptions that have followed. During his visit, Mr. Trump left no doubt which side he was on, dismissing suggestions of “systemic racism” and scolding reporters who asked about it, saying they should concentrate instead on the violent response. “You have anarchists and you have the looters and you have the rioters and you have all types, you have agitators, and that’s what you should be focusing on with your question,” the president said. He has sought to keep the focus on instances of chaos in the streets while blaming “radical left Democrats” as he heads into the fall campaign trailing the Democratic nominee, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in the polls. Mr. Trump prefers talking about law and order to discussing the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed more than 184,000 lives in the United States. In recent days, the president has cast the turmoil in increasingly conspiratorial terms. In an interview on Monday night on Fox News, he described mysterious people secretly pulling Mr. Biden’s strings and talked cryptically about a planeload of black-clad anarchists flying to Washington last week to disrupt the Republican National Convention. “People that you’ve never heard of” are controlling Mr. Biden, he told the Fox News host Laura Ingraham. “People that are in the dark shadows.” “What does that mean?” Ms. Ingraham asked. “That sounds like conspiracy theory.” “No,” Mr. Trump answered. “People that you haven’t heard of. They’re people that are on the streets. They’re people that are controlling the streets. We had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend, and in the plane, it was almost completely loaded with thugs wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms with gear and this and that. They’re on a plane.” During the same interview, the president said police officers who shoot civilians simply succumb to pressure as a golfer does attempting a putt. “They choke,” he said. “Just like in a golf tournament, they miss a three-foot.” Asked about the supposed planeload of thugs before boarding Air Force One bound for Kenosha on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump was hardly any clearer about where he was getting his information. “I can probably refer you to the person and they could do it,” he told reporters. “I’d like to ask that person if it was OK. But a person was on a plane, said that there were about six people like that person, more or less, and what happened is the entire plane filled up with the looters, the anarchists, the rioters, people that obviously were looking for trouble.” The White House later pointed to a new federal investigation of the financing of rioters. “The president is referring to questions that need answers such as who may be funding travel and lodging for organized rioters,” Sarah Matthews, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement. Mr. Trump has long embraced conspiracy theories, but in recent days he has increasingly trafficked in dark ideas from the world of QAnon and other fringe elements. He promoted a supposed medical expert who talks about demon sperm and alien DNA, and he endorsed a congressional candidate who subscribes to QAnon theories of a “global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles.” Over the weekend, he reposted Twitter messages asserting that the death toll from the coronavirus had been vastly overstated and that street protests were actually a secretly organized “coup attempt” against him.
