By Ken Belson Jake Scott, the free-spirited, hard-nosed free safety who was a cornerstone of the Miami Dolphins dynasty in the 1970s and the Most Valuable Player in Super Bowl VII, which capped the league’s only undefeated season, died on Thursday in Atlanta. He was 75. Scott fell down a flight of steps while visiting friends, had surgery to repair a spinal injury and died in the hospital 10 days later, according to his brother-in-law, Randy Fabal. After two standout seasons at Georgia and a year with the B.C. Lions of the Canadian Football League — where he went after a falling-out with his college coach — Scott was drafted by the Dolphins in the seventh round in 1970. Coach Don Shula, who had taken over the hapless Dolphins that year, made Scott a starter and was instantly rewarded. Scott, a wily and fearless defender, had a team-record 35 interceptions in his six seasons in Miami, where he was also a punt returner with a reputation for never calling for a fair catch. He was selected to five Pro Bowls from 1971 to 1975 and, with Dick Anderson, formed one of the best duos of safeties in league history. Scott’s two interceptions in Super Bowl VII — including one in the end zone that he returned to midfield — helped keep the Washington Redskins offense from scoring. (Washington’s only points in the game, played in Los Angeles, came on a fumble return. Miami won, 14-7.) “I think I’ll give Bill Kilmer an extra set of keys,” Scott said of the Redskins’ quarterback after Scott received a car for his M.V.P. performance. In Super Bowl VIII against the Minnesota Vikings — which the Dolphins also won, 24-7 — Scott recovered two fumbles. Scott was not a fan of authority figures, including the demanding Shula. On the Dolphins’ team bus ride to the stadium before Super Bowl VII, Shula, who had already lost two Super Bowls as a coach, told Scott to keep it down. “What are you worried about, being the chokingest coach in the history of the Super Bowl?” Scott shot back, according to the Dolphins tight end Jim Mandich. Scott had taken a $5,000 pay cut to sign with the Dolphins, but made up for it when he floated the idea of leaving for the upstart World Football League, where his teammates Larry Csonka, Jim Kiick and Paul Warfield ended up. Not wanting to lose a top defender, the Dolphins gave Scott a five-year contract worth $600,000, the equivalent of more than $3 million today. (Kiick died in June at 73, just weeks after Shula did at 90.) But after several run-ins with Shula, including a dispute over whether Scott could play injured, Scott was traded to Washington before the 1976 season and finished his career there in 1978 with 49 total interceptions. Scott and Shula did not speak for decades after the trade. A lifelong bachelor, Scott shunned the spotlight, attended few alumni events and rarely spoke to the media. He invested his money in car dealerships, which he lost, but traveled widely, was an avid fisherman and split his time between homes in Colorado; Key West, Fla.; and the island of Kauai, in Hawaii. “He’s the only man I’ve known who lived life entirely on his own terms,” said Stan Stanfill, a longtime friend and the son of Bill Stanfill, a teammate of Scott’s at Georgia and in Miami. Jacob Eugene Scott III was born on July 20, 1945, in Greenwood, S.C., to Mary (Hughie) Scott, an educator, and Jacob Eugene Scott, a pulp wood contractor. When he was young, Scott moved to Athens, Ga., where his mother earned a doctorate in education at the University of Georgia. In Athens, Jake idolized Fran Tarkenton, a former local high school quarterback who went on to star at Georgia and in the National Football League. In 1962, Scott’s family moved to the Washington area, where Scott played high school football and was a water boy for the Redskins. Tarkenton remembered Scott as a youth football player and helped recruit him to play for the University of Georgia, where Tarkenton had taken a course taught by Scott’s mother. Scott is survived by his sister, Rita Scott Fabal. Scott sat out his freshman year with injuries, then led Georgia in interceptions in both 1967 and 1968; in both seasons he was named a first-team all-S.E.C. defensive back. Though he played just two seasons for the Bulldogs, several of his records still stand. He left the team after Coach Vince Dooley chose to take the team to the Sugar Bowl instead of the more prestigious Orange Bowl — a decision for which Scott never forgave him. He decided instead to play in Canada in what would have been his senior year. Dooley, though, admired Scott’s talents and lobbied successfully for his induction into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2011. Scott, who was in Hawaii, did not show up for the induction ceremony. In 2006, he also turned down an invitation from the N.F.L. to attend Super Bowl XL, where former M.V.P.s were being honored. “I don’t need the money,” Scott told the South Florida newspaper The Sun-Sentinel that year. “I don’t need it for my ego.” A decade later, he attended Super Bowl 50 and joined his old roommate, Bill Stanfill, at a Dolphins Honor Roll induction ceremony. Shula was on hand to congratulate them. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
