Gavin Newsom said. RIGHT NOW The Oakland Zoo is among the institutions that have closed because of concerns about poor air quality in the Bay Area. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California on Monday addressed a state besieged by wildfires of staggering scale and spread, assuring residents that “we’ve deployed every resource at our disposal” as the number of active fires grew to 625. And even though a new front of lightning storms was less severe than expected, Mr. Newsom emphasized that almost 300 lightning strikes overnight had sparked 10 new fires — every one of which could have become a new threat. More than 7,000 fires have chewed through 1.4 million acres this year, making this fire season one of the most active ever. By this point in 2019, 4,292 fires had burned 56,000 acres across the state, Mr. Newsom said. Tens of thousands of firefighters from across California and states from as far away as Kansas have been enlisted to help contain the blazes, which have been linked to seven deaths.

Hundreds of fire engines have been sent out across a huge portion of the state — including to towering forests that are being charred by fires “the likes of which haven’t been seen in modern recorded history,” Mr. Newsom said. But climate experts warned that the activity so early in the year and across such varied landscapes offers a preview of a fire and flood cycle that is likely to keep getting worse. “I’m running out of superlatives,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at the University of California, Los Angeles. Mr. Swain said he expected this year to have the greatest number of acres burned under California’s modern fire suppression regimen. More troubling, he said, was that fires have burned ecosystems where there were not typically wildfires. Fire is common in expanses of dry grass and chaparral, particularly following a dry winter like the one this year. But burning Joshua trees, redwoods and coniferous forests? That is alarming, he said. “I actually don’t know of any vegetation type that is not on fire in California,” he said.

Lightning Complex, which stretches across Napa and surrounding counties, has grown to 350,000 acres but is now 22 percent contained. Shana Jones, the chief for Cal Fire’s Sonoma-Lake-Napa unit, said at a news conference on Monday that firefighters were “making good progress” on the complex. But she added that given the size and complexity, “it’s going to take time to put this fire out.”
