An Italian ocean liner makes its way into New York Harbor after a 13-day voyage from Genoa. Passengers, many of them in tears, pack the deck as the ship glides past the Statue of Liberty. After the devastation of the war, they’ve made it to America — to a country that, for the immigrants aboard, represents safety, freedom, abundance and hope in an otherwise broken world. Among the immigrants are my grandmother Nina, a refugee who has already fled Russia, Germany and now Italy, and her 10-year-old daughter, Xenia — my mother. They are beneficiaries of an expansion of the 1948 Displaced Persons Act, the first version of which Harry Truman nearly vetoed because, while letting in 200,000 European refugees, it was written in a way that was intended to exclude Jews and Catholics. Imagine that: An American president who decries an immigration bill because, as he wrote in his signing statement, it is “flagrantly discriminatory” and “mocks the American tradition of fair play.” “There was a sweetness in America back then,” my mom tells me as we chat about this year’s presidential election and she recalls the country as it was when she arrived. “That sweetness seems totally gone.” My mom, who calls herself a “conservative socialist,” is the sort of persuadable voter Donald Trump might have been able to win over if he had governed differently. She couldn’t bring herself to vote at all in 2016 — Trump was too disgusting; Hillary Clinton was too entitled — but she wasn’t entirely crestfallen about the result, either. “Give him a chance,” she told her shellshocked grandkids as the election night returns came in. “Sometimes it’s good to shake things up.” Four years on, she’s given the president a chance. Her verdict: “If Trump were running against a giraffe, I’d vote for the giraffe.” It’s not that she disagrees with everything Trump has done. “He hasn’t been bad for Israel,” she says, while adding, “He has no sense of loyalty; he could turn on anyone on a dime.” She feels strongly that immigrants should only come to this country legally: “My mother and I waited for years to get our visas; nobody should get to jump the line.” She deeply admired Ruth Bader Ginsburg as a trailblazer and role model but found herself impressed by Amy Coney Barrett’s intelligence and poise after watching last month’s confirmation hearings.
