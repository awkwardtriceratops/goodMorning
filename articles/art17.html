Then Derrick Henry Showed Up.<br></h1><p id="artcont">TITANS 30, RAVENS 24 | OVERTIME Titans running back Derrick Henry’s 29-yard touchdown run sealed a contentious overtime win over the Ravens, who have now lost three of their last four games. By Bill Pennington When two teams scuffle on the field before the game even starts and both head coaches appear to still be at odds after the final whistle, it is pretty clear the contest was something more than just another regular-season N.F.L. game. Indeed, when the Tennessee Titans defeated the Baltimore Ravens, 30-24, in overtime Sunday, the outcome was a weighty, emotional lift for the struggling Titans and their sledgehammer running back, Derrick Henry, who delivered the final gut punch to the reeling Ravens. One team left the field buoyant, the other rattled and questioning itself. It was a rematch of the A.F.C. divisional round playoff game from January, when Tennessee upset Baltimore to end the Ravens’ run as a top Super Bowl contender. In the wake of Sunday’s loss, it is not a stretch to say the Ravens, who now have a 6-4 record, have yet to recover from that playoff defeat. Adding to Baltimore’s letdown was the stunning climax to Sunday’s defeat: Henry ran over several members of the Ravens’ vaunted defense on his way to an authoritative, 29-yard touchdown that left the Titans celebrating in the Baltimore end zone.

In that period, the Titans had 24 members of their organization, including multiple players, test positive for the coronavirus, which resulted in two postponed games and $350,000 in fines from the N.F.L. for violating virus protocols. “We said this all week: We have to start doing things that will break us away from the pack,” Titans Coach Mike Vrabel said. “Today was a great team win. Thankful to be their football coach.” Asked if the victory re-established Tennessee, which lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in last season’s A.F.C. championship game, as a gritty contender in a conference with several high-performing teams, Vrabel said: “I think so. I hope so. I know that the players believe that and can see that.” The Ravens, losers in three of their four games after an October bye week, were wondering what had gone wrong after a 5-1 start to the season.
