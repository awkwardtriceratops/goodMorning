Join us Friday for a conversation about what happened and what’s ahead.    The speeches are being delivered in empty rooms. The festivities migrated to video chats. And on Friday, Aug. 21 at 11 a.m. ET, Times Politics reporters Astead W. Herndon, Katie Glueck and Matt Flegenheimer will gather for a 30-minute analysis and recap of the Democratic National Convention. Hosted by deputy politics editor Rachel Dry, they’ll discuss Joe Biden’s acceptance speech and how his career has prepared him for this moment — and more. (You can tune in live to the event on Friday, Aug. 21 at 11 a.m. ET on this page. We’ll be streaming it in the video above.)
