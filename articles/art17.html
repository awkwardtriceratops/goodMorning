By Mike Seely Amy Jackson, an early-education instructor at the Center School in Greenfield, Mass., remembers one rainy day a few years ago when she was outside with her students. They thought they were prepared. Everyone was wearing rain gear, and ropes and tarps were used to erect a makeshift shelter. But soon the children were “cold, wet, droopy,” and heading back inside became inevitable. “The only child in good spirits was the one wearing the Oaki one-piece rain suit,” Ms. Jackson said, referring to the company that makes outdoor apparel for children. The Center School has committed to an all-outdoor curriculum this fall to guard against the spread of the coronavirus among its students and staff. Tents and outdoor desks have been procured to create al fresco classrooms. The school has also recommended that parents buy their children Oaki rainsuits, priced at $60 to $70. They are not the only ones. With a number of schools in the United States opting for outdoor education over the potentially germier confines of their traditional indoor spaces, demand for Oaki’s rainsuits and related gear “has been overwhelming,” said Sam Taylor, the chief executive of the company, which is based in the Salt Lake City area. It’s a sentiment echoed by other outdoor-oriented companies, some of which are launching new product lines or repurposing existing ones to capitalize on how the pandemic has changed the education experience. Mr. Taylor said demand for Oaki products has increased 60 percent this year, a challenge because the company is experiencing pandemic-related delays with its manufacturers in India and Mexico. As a result, Mr. Taylor has “prioritized individual schools or parents” over warehouse and retail orders. He has also rushed to market a line of fleece and wool socks that don’t need to be washed every day, in response to a request from a Vermont school. “There’s been a ton of research that’s shown how productive being outside is,” Mr. Taylor said. “There’s no reason a little moisture or rain should stop that. If anything, that should be a positive if you’ve got the right gear.” Those searching for weatherproof supplies have also turned to Rite in the Rain, a century-old company based in Tacoma, Wash., that sells waterproof products including notebooks and printer paper. “We start with a wet-strength, virgin-grain paper, then we coat it using a proprietary machine and process and formula,” said Ryan McDonald, its director of marketing. “The process allows for water to bead up on the paper, but still allow for writing.” Fifty percent of Rite in the Rain’s business comes from the government, mostly the military. But aside from “pretty decent business with college bookstores,” Mr. McDonald said, it hadn’t focused much on students until recently, with an increase in orders from elementary and high schools. Bienenstock Natural Playgrounds has also shifted its focus. Bienenstock, a Canadian business that has an office in the Denver area, designs and builds school playgrounds, but when the pandemic shut schools in March, “that was the end to that side of the business,” said Adam Bienenstock, the company’s founder and principal designer.
