Here Is a Window to Escape.<br></h1><p id="artcont">On ancient stones and new barriers, computer screens and emergency exits. By Nicole Krauss Ms. Krauss is a writer. A long time ago, I read of a torture technique that a journalist heard was used by Hamas on residents of Gaza suspected of being informants: The person is shown a wall onto which a staircase is drawn, and at the top is a drawing of a bicycle. The person is told to go up and get the bicycle. But it’s only a drawing, he says. He is told that if he doesn’t bring the bicycle down the stairs, he will be beaten. And when, again, he appeals to his torturer’s reason, to the reality in which both the staircase and the bicycle are drawings, he is hit. At this moment he understands that he has been left alone in a reality he believed was shared. He has been abandoned there, while the others have departed to a new reality in which a person can be tortured for being unable to do what is asked because it is physically impossible. In that same article, there was, as I recall, a photograph of the concrete blocks of the Israel/Palestine wall, on which someone had scrawled “CTL+ALT+DLT.” Here in Brooklyn, my children no longer attend school and instead are on the sofa rapidly tapping the buttons of their keyboards to bash down a wall in Minecraft. In that medieval landscape of the future, they have built houses for themselves, they own dogs, they have somehow exchanged emeralds mined from a cave for melon seeds and pigs. With whom did you trade the emeralds for the pigs? I ask. With the villagers, they say, distractedly, not lifting their eyes from their screens. Earlier this week, the older one, mining the internet, dug up an old video of President Trump’s appearance on a late-night show, and since then they have been watching it over and over, unable to control their laughter. In it, the president, who has yet to win the election and become the president, says that in the wall he intends to build on the border there will be “a beautiful, big, fat door,” through which people will enter the country. In the years since the airing of this late-night appearance, very many people have been told they must enter through this door, even though it doesn’t exist. The part about the beautiful door is funny, but the really funny part, as far as my children are concerned, is when the late-night host gives the future president a chance to apologize to anyone he wants, and the president can’t think of anyone. No one at all? Nope, the president says. It is winter now, then spring, then summer, and already fall. Those of us with homes have been told to take refuge there, to stay within the walls. As such, no one can reach anyone except via satellite, and our only shared reality is the news, and the numbers of infections and fatalities. A friend, nearing the end of a two-week quarantine with her family in a small apartment in Jerusalem, tells me that once they made it through the first week, her dark mood began to lift. “La’ga’at ba’kir” was the expression my friend used, which means “to touch the wall”: The hardest part of the challenge was behind now, the finish in sight. Later, after we end our call, it occurs to me that at 46 I have almost certainly touched the wall in my life, but have none of the eagerness to be finished that the expression suggests.
