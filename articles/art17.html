By Gina Kolata It is an idea that may never have been tried in wide-scale vaccine distribution: Citing principles of equity and justice, experts are urging that people living in communities hardest-hit by the pandemic, which are often made up of Black and Hispanic populations, get a portion of the first, limited supply of coronavirus vaccines set aside just for them. A committee of experts advising Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is considering the idea. But as it comes into focus, its underlying concepts and execution must be further defined, and the approach may then face legal and political challenges, even as the medical system grapples with the anticipated logistical hurdles of distributing new vaccines. The group that is formulating the allocation plan is the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which consists of experts in medicine or public health who advise the C.D.C. on schedules for providing vaccine schedules for diseases like flu or chickenpox. It will discuss a variety of ethical issues during its next meeting on Friday, but members say it will not vote on a final proposal until a vaccine receives either full approval or an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, likely weeks or months from now. There are currently four vaccines in late-stage trials in the U.S. The current plan under consideration draws heavily from several proposals, particularly one developed by the National Academy of Sciences. Dr. Helene Gayle, the co-chair of the committee that devised that framework, noted that the issue her committee grappled with was racism, not race. Racism leads to social vulnerability, she said, with people holding low-wage jobs that place them at higher risk of infection and living in crowded neighborhoods and households. “Inequities in health have always existed, but at this moment there is an awakening to the power of racism, poverty and bias in amplifying the health and economic pain and hardship imposed by this pandemic,” said Dr. Gayle, a former infectious disease specialist at the C.D.C. who is now president and chief executive of The Chicago Community Trust. Such impacts are seen in the way that some groups, including people living in crowded neighborhoods with jobs like nursing home aides — situations that tend to apply more often to people of color — are getting sick and dying from Covid-19 at a much higher rate than the rest of the population. Dr. Eboni Price-Haywood, director of the Center for Outcomes and Health Services Research at Ochsner Health in New Orleans, said she often shows audiences a map of New Orleans that depicts areas of low income housing where people rely on public transportation, where there are increased numbers of multigenerational households with a grandparent as caregiver, and where there is a high density of poverty. The map, she said, “overlaps with a predominance of Black households.”
