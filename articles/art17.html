The Lakers lead the series, 3-2. By Sopan Deb and Marc Stein The Miami Heat were not in the mood for a coronation Friday night. They pulled off yet another surprising win in Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals, beating the Lakers in a thriller, 111-108. They pushed the series to a Game 6 on Sunday. The Lakers lead the series, 3-2. Jimmy Butler put the Heat on his back, accumulating a triple double (35 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists) and going one-on-one against LeBron James down the stretch. His free throws with 16.8 seconds left put the Heat up for good. Miami led by double digits in the first half and then again in the final quarter. Duncan Robinson (26 points) and Kendrick Nunn (14 points) also provided sparks for the Heat. Robinson hit a 3-pointer early in the fourth quarter to put the Heat up by nine and drew a charge on James minutes later. Lakers Coach Frank Vogel unsuccessfully challenged the call, which meant the Lakers had only one timeout for the rest of the game. This left the Lakers vulnerable, and forced them to go the length of the floor to try to tie the game with less than two seconds left.
