House Seat<br></h1><p id="artcont">Supported by Jeff Van Drew, a Republican congressman who defected from the Democrats, beat back a challenge from a former schoolteacher who is married to a Kennedy nephew. By Patrick McGeehan and Tracey Tully Representative Jeff Van Drew, a onetime Democrat who switched parties in December and declared allegiance to President Trump, held onto his New Jersey seat in a race against Amy Kennedy, a former teacher who married into an American political dynasty. The race was the last New Jersey congressional contest to be decided, and one of only two in the state won by a Republican. Mr. Van Drew’s protracted victory appeared to vindicate his politically fraught decision to cross party lines and align himself with the president during last year’s impeachment proceedings. The Associated Press declared Mr. Van Drew the winner at midday on Friday. Its tally showed that he had received 51.5 percent of the votes, compared with 46.9 percent for Ms. Kennedy. First elected to the House two years ago as a Democrat, Mr. Van Drew overcame his opponent’s lead in most polls, a considerable fund-raising disadvantage and the familiarity of the Kennedy name. Ms. Kennedy’s husband, Patrick Kennedy, a former congressman from Rhode Island, is a nephew of President John F. Kennedy. “Jeff Van Drew has been around a long time, and he’s got cross-party support, but I was not expecting a drop-off like that,” said Michael Suleiman, chairman of the Atlantic County Democratic Committee. “I wish Amy had a better showing out of Atlantic County.” Local observers attributed much of that falloff to the work of Craig Callaway, a notorious political operative whom Mr. Van Drew had paid more than $100,000 for his get-out-the-vote efforts. Mr. Callaway, who served more than three years in prison for bribery, specializes in delivering mail ballots from low-income precincts in and around Atlantic City, a Democratic stronghold. State law was changed five years ago to limit to three the number of ballots a “messenger” can deliver to a polling place or collection site. Mr. Callaway had worked for Ms. Kennedy during the Democratic primary, but after a falling out signed on with the Van Drew campaign. “It’s been a controversial operation over time, but it’s never been actually proven vote fraud,” said John Froonjian, director of the William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy at Stockton University. Mr. Callaway did not respond to messages seeking comment. Mr. Van Drew was a vocal opponent of the president’s impeachment and joined the Republicans in December when it became clear that he could not count on re-election support from Democratic leaders in his South Jersey district, setting up a marquee House race infused with national angst. “A lot of money and a lot of power was used against me, quite frankly, to remove me from my seat during a difficult year,” Mr. Van Drew said in an address to supporters late Tuesday, which his campaign manager, Ron Filan, said was a declaration of victory. “But the truth is, we believed,” he added. “We believed in the America that we know, the America that we love, the America that we know is this great place.” Mr. Van Drew was able to overcome the stigma of switching parties, buoyed by Mr. Trump’s warm embrace in a district that the president won by about five points in 2016. Comparable results for Mr. Trump in the district this year were not available. In another close congressional contest in South Jersey, Representative Andy Kim, a first-term Democrat, defeated David Richter, a wealthy Republican businessman who similarly yoked himself to Mr. Trump during the campaign. Representative Tom Malinowski, a first-term Democrat who, like Mr. Kim, was elected two years ago in a so-called blue wave aligned against Mr. Trump, defeated Thomas Kean Jr., the minority leader of the State Senate. In other races, Representative Mikie Sherrill, a first-term Democrat and former Navy helicopter pilot, beat Rosemary Becchi, a tax lawyer, and U.S. Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat, was re-elected in his race against the Republican candidate, Rik Mehta, a biotech entrepreneur. The election in New Jersey was conducted mostly by mail and yielded a voter turnout that Gov. Philip D. Murphy said on Thursday would exceed four million and be the highest in the state’s history. Soon after Mr. Van Drew switched parties — with a pledge of “undying support” for Mr. Trump — the president came to the district for a raucous, campaign-style rally that solidified the lifelong Democrat’s standing in the eyes of many Republicans. Still, he was outraised by Ms. Kennedy, who generated $4.25 million in contributions, compared with the $3.9 million he was able to bank. It was Ms. Kennedy’s first run for elective office. A mother of five, she is the education director for a mental health advocacy group founded by her husband, Patrick J. Kennedy, who represented Rhode Island in the House until 2010. It is the second big Kennedy family loss of the year. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, 40, mounted an unsuccessful Democratic primary challenge against Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts. When he leaves the House in January, there will be no Kennedy in Congress. The last time that happened was in 2011, when Patrick J. Kennedy gave up his seat after struggling with mental illness and drug addiction, marking the first time since 1947 that no member of the family had held federal office. Ms. Kennedy was shown to have about a five-point edge over Mr. Van Drew in a Monmouth University poll conducted in late September. But the race was considered by the Cook Political Report to be a tossup in a district that had been represented by a Republican for 24 years before Mr. Van Drew was elected in 2018. Mr. Van Drew, a retired dentist, rose in politics from mayor of Dennis, N.J., to county legislator to state lawmaker, serving in both the Assembly and Senate in one of the most conservative regions of the state. His decision to join the Republicans sent political shock waves through the district, leading Mr. Richter, his would-be Republican opponent, to pack his bags to run in an adjacent district against Mr. Kim, clearing a wide path for Mr. Van Drew. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
