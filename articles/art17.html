POP & ROCK Best to stay in this Halloween weekend, lest you encounter 2020’s most frightening monster: the superspreader event. Luckily, plenty of musicians are offering at-home entertainment to keep the holiday spirit alive. Though the experimental musician Circuit des Yeux recently announced her retirement from online concerts, she will perform virtually one last time under Saturday’s full blue moon. Her brew of folk and electronica radiates spooky intensity; for this set, streaming on Constellation Chicago’s YouTube channel at 9:30 p.m. Eastern time, she’ll give her spin on fan-selected covers. Tickets, available at Constellation’s website, are $15. The touring rap festival Rolling Loud made a memorable New York debut last October. This year, its online proxy, Loud Stream, presents a more modest alternative. The Young Thug protégée Gunna headlines on Friday; the emo rapper Trippie Redd tops the bill on Saturday. Performances will stream free on Twitch, beginning both days at 6 p.m. A small Brooklyn club with a big heart, Baby’s All Right will continue its ongoing series of virtual gigs on its website with a Halloween variety show, starting at 9 p.m. on Saturday, courtesy of the video production company House of Nod. The indie-rock group Japanese Breakfast will headline; tickets are available on a sliding scale at Eventbrite, with proceeds benefiting the artists and the staff at Baby’s All Right.
OLIVIA HORN THEATER Who’s buried in Grant’s tomb? No one, though Ulysses S. Grant and his wife are entombed inside. Who will be murdered outside it? A lot of ancient Romans. In honor of Halloween, the masked actors of Rogue Ensemble Theater Company will stage an outdoor, socially distanced production of “Titus Andronicus,” Shakespeare’s goriest tragedy, on the mausoleum’s grounds in Riverside Park. Tickets for performances, which run through Sunday, are available at Eventbrite for a suggested donation of $10 — a bargain when you consider it provides one sacrifice, one execution, one honor killing, one death by exposure, two children baked into pies and various other violent ends. If in-person theater feels too risky, you can send chills down your spine remotely with Annoyance Theater’s “Splatter Theater,” live online Friday and Saturday at 10 p.m. Eastern time as a fund-raiser (a donation of $20 is suggested). A 34-year tradition, this show spoofs slasher films like “Halloween” and “Friday the 13th” with literal buckets of fake blood (the secret recipe: corn syrup, chocolate syrup and red and blue dyes). How will the masked killer murder characters when the actors are performing from their respective homes? That’s a sticky and extremely 2020 kind of problem for the directors Joe McDaniel and Cassidy Russell. One upside: Fake blood can’t splash you through a computer screen.
ALEXIS SOLOSKI DANCE What with an ongoing pandemic and a fate-of-the-world election at hand, art that can briefly transport you to another plane of existence might be especially appealing this weekend. Pam Tanowitz’s 2018 dance “Four Quartets” is that kind of work, and from Saturday morning to Sunday night, it’s available online for the first time, on the Upstreaming site of the Fisher Center at Bard (tickets are on a sliding scale from $10 to $25; a $100 all-access pass adds a making-of documentary and a livestreamed conversation on Friday night).
