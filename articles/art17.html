By Michael Levenson A manhunt was underway in Colorado on Wednesday after the authorities recently discovered the skeletal remains of three people near a tiny rural town near the New Mexico border. A warrant for homicide was issued for Adre Jordan Baroz, 26, after investigators said they had found the remains on two properties near Los Sauces, in Conejos County, Colo. The authorities did not say how they had connected Mr. Baroz to the remains, but said that people in the community know Mr. Baroz by his nickname, Psycho. Law enforcement agents warned that he was dangerous and said that the discovery of the remains had deeply unsettled people in the county, which is home to about 8,000 residents, many of them farmers and ranchers.
