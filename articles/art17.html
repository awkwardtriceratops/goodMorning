By Mark Leibovich WASHINGTON — There is, traditionally, a predictable rhythm to the start of a “much-awaited hearing” on Capitol Hill. There are protesters and counterprotesters, enhanced police and news media presences, insufferable opening statements and an overall sense that something more momentous than usual might be going on. The start of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett on Monday had all of that. But like everything else in Washington these days, this was an entirely different kind of pinstripe rodeo. Start with the hazmat suits. “We are making a point,” said Jennie Spector, one of a few dozen demonstrators dressed in white hazmat suits convened outside the Hart Senate Office Building. It was insane to be holding these hearings, Ms. Spector said. After all, two Republicans on the committee had recently tested positive for the coronavirus. And the committee chairman, Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who was among those at the White House “super spreader” event last month, had refused to get tested in recent days. But there they all were. Showtime in a potential petri dish. For the record, Ms. Spector said she purchased her hazmat suit at Walgreens. Apparently you can buy hazmat suits at Walgreens these days. How 2020 is that? The white jumpsuits doubled as decent rain gear in the morning drizzle. Inside, everyone seemed to be remarking upon the senators’ varying degrees of public health diligence or recklessness. Viral vulnerability and co-morbidities were assessed. Senators Dianne Feinstein and Charles E. Grassley are 87! As a general rule, U.S. Capitol Police officers have been diligent in their enforcement of mask requirements, with blatant exceptions. Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, who attended the super spreader event — the Rose Garden announcement of President Trump’s nomination of Judge Barrett to the Supreme Court — and tested positive soon after, delivered his opening statement sans mask. He had previously assured everyone that he had been “cleared” by his doctor. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, appeared remotely as he was self-quarantined after coming in contact with an infected party (Mr. Lee). Hand sanitizer, disinfecting machines and wipe dispensers are the new candy bowls in Senate offices. Other novelties were more subtle, but telling. Upon gaveling the proceedings to order, Mr. Graham opened what he called “the hearing to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court,” a choice of words that pretty much gave away the game at the outset. Usually, the parliamentary term of art is for the chairman to commence a hearing to “consider the nomination” of so and so, not merely rubber stamp, or “confirm,” the nominee. In other words, this would not be a deliberation as much as a media spectacle convened amid particles that may or may not be lethal. “This is probably not about persuading each other unless something really dramatic happens,” Mr. Graham said. “All the Republicans will vote yes. All the Democrats will vote no.” It raised an obvious question: Why were we even here? There was a certain low energy to the whole tableau. Numbers of both pro- and anti-Barrett demonstrators were less than what you’d expect on Opening Day of a big Senate proceeding. It was a holiday. It was raining. It was Monday. Chants were muffled by germ masks. People seemed to be going through the motions. They seemed tired. The hearings droned on through a procession of opening statements from the senators — 22 — before Judge Barrett even uttered a word. Fun! Mr. Graham was an obvious person of interest. In addition to his role as chairman and ubiquity in Mr. Trump’s orbit, he faces a possible reckoning at the polls next month in a tight re-election campaign. He also has a habit of spectacular about-faces — all caught on video — on everything from his previous ill feelings toward Mr. Trump to whether Senate Republicans should have the right to fill a Supreme Court vacancy shortly before a presidential election. No way, he declared in 2018. “You can use words against me,” he thundered at the time, and of course, no one had been waiting for his permission. Another high-curiosity figure for obvious reasons was Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s running mate.
