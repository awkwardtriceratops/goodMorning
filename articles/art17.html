By Jochen Bittner Contributing Opinion Writer HAMBURG, Germany — A Turkish friend told me the other day about his summer travels to his home region in southeastern Anatolia, a particularly poverty-stricken part of Turkey. Under the rule of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, things have improved. My friend’s cousin showed off his new Mercedes-Benz, bragging about the state aid his family received and his general well-being. “I live like an American here!” he said. So of course he would vote again for Mr. Erdogan, who has been in power for the best part of two decades. The imprisonment of government critics? Not for him to worry about. The story crystallized a key dilemma of the 21st century. As authoritarian leaders oversee economic success, the importance of civil liberties — ensuring freedom from arbitrary punishment and harassment — may dwindle. The abstract notion of human rights may be much less appealing than the reality of being lifted from hardship, insecurity and hunger.
