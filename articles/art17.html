By Farah Stockman Ms. Stockman is a member of the editorial board. In 2017, after the Portland, Ore., police fatally shot her 17-year-old grandson, Donna Hayes got invited to City Hall to meet Mayor Ted Wheeler, who expressed his deepest sympathies. He had been in office for only seven weeks. “I actually felt sorry for him,” Ms. Hayes told me. But since then, no police officer has been punished for Quanice Hayes’s death. And other Black men have been fatally shot by Portland police. And this summer, amid protests against racial injustice in policing, Portland police officers have tear-gassed and injured protesters. “I stopped feeling sorry for him,” said Ms. Hayes, who has been an active participant in the protests. “I told our mayor that if he didn’t want the city destroyed, he better do something.” After a summer of mass protests around the country in the wake of George Floyd’s death, numerous mayors are under pressure from activists who are furious with their police departments. Seattle’s mayor, Jenny Durkan, is facing calls for her resignation because of police treatment of protesters. Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis was booed by a crowd outside his home after he refused to say he supported dismantling the police. Mayor Lyda Krewson of St. Louis had to move out of her home temporarily after hundreds of protesters showed up outside, chanting “Resign Lyda, take the cops with you.” The full political impact of the protests has yet to be seen. The mayors of Seattle, Minneapolis and St. Louis are up for re-election next year. But in some cities that have been roiled by protests, next week’s election provides the first chance voters have to cast a ballot since the protests. In Richmond, Va., Mayor Levar Stoney initially struggled with allegations that his police department had used excessive force to put down the protests, which led to the ousting of the city’s police chief. Protesters banged pots and pans outside Mr. Stoney’s downtown apartment building, chanting “Sellout Stoney.” (Mr. Stoney is Black.) But since then, he appears to have regained his footing after removing Confederate statues, and now appears headed for re-election. In Baltimore, the front-runner in the race for mayor, the City Council president Brandon Scott, who is also Black, has expressed solidarity with the protesters.
