The Crispr Revolution and the New Era of Genome Editing
By Kevin Davies In July 2019, MIT Technology Review took a break from its usual beats, such as artificial intelligence and biotechnology, to offer some news from the world of book publishing. “The Crispr story has arrived for the grand telling as a miracle of our age,” the journal announced. “The proof?

Like many, I am experiencing a pandemic-induced amnesia of the Before Times. I turned to this newspaper’s archive for help, and there I discovered that July 2019 was the month that the United States women’s soccer team won the World Cup. I looked at the photograph of Megan Rapinoe celebrating her team’s victory and marveled at how fiercely she embraced her teammates, screaming in unmasked joy, before a stadium filled with socially undistanced fans. We did that kind of thing once. July 2019 was also a time when we eagerly looked forward to books about Crispr. And now, deep in the pandemic, the first of the four promised ones — “Editing Humanity,” by Kevin Davies — has finally arrived.
