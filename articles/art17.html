After Donald Trump was elected president, the filmmakers Christina Clusiau and Shaul Schwarz were granted rare access to the operations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Since Mr. Trump had campaigned on a hard-line immigration agenda, the leaders of the usually secretive agency jumped at a chance to have their story told from the inside. Today, we speak to the filmmakers about what they saw during nearly three years at ICE and how the Trump administration reacted to a cut of the film. On today’s episode: Christina Clusiau and Shaul Schwarz, the filmmakers behind the six-hour documentary series “Immigration Nation.” Background reading: The Trump administration has threatened the two filmmakers with legal action and fought to delay the release of “Immigration Nation” until after the election.
