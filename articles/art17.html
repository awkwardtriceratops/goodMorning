Kiarie, a mom of three in Montclair, N.J., enjoys listening in as she nurses her newborn and helps her third-grader manage his own remote learning. But on one recent morning, the Zoom conversation took an unexpected turn: Emerson’s teacher asked the class to share what they ate for dinner the night before. After every child took a turn, Kiarie heard the teacher say, “I had turkey and vegetables for dinner last night. My husband and I are trying to eat less carbs, so we didn’t eat any bread.” Kiarie, who is also a registered dietitian specializing in family feeding, was alarmed. “I know it’s a seemingly harmless conversation, but these teachers are role models,” she said. “Some kids are going to hear that and think ‘bread is bad.’” For another recent class assignment, Emerson was asked to group foods like watermelon and doughnuts into “healthy” and “unhealthy” categories. In Denver, Julie Ralston’s 15-year-old daughter, Katie, received an assignment for a remote weight training class asking her to keep a food log for two weeks where she would count calories and track her intake of proteins, carbohydrates and fat grams, then use that information to develop her own nutrition plan. Ralston, a former health coach who considers herself in recovery from a disordered relationship with food, was horrified. “Katie was in tears. She said, ‘Every time I go to eat something now, it makes me not want to eat it because I’ll have to write it down,’” she said. Schools have long incorporated nutrition lessons developed by the United States Department of Agriculture into their curriculums: In the 1980s, children studied a “food wheel,” which became the Food Pyramid in 1992, and was replaced with MyPlate in 2011. And dietitians have been concerned about the impact of these lessons for just about as long. “This issue has always been on my radar,” said Sarah Ganginis, a dietitian who specializes in eating disorder treatment in Ellicott City, Md. “Many of my clients can trace their food anxieties and body dissatisfaction back to something that happened or a comment someone made when they were in gym class or health class or somewhere else at school,” she said. But the rise of remote schooling has brought a renewed scrutiny to the way educators talk and teach about food and body weight, as parents overhear stray comments on Zoom meetings and print worksheets for aspects of their children’s curriculum they may not have encountered before. “Folks are sending me math problems all about someone counting calories on a diet,” said Anna Lutz, a dietitian in private practice in Raleigh, N.C. She has also heard from parents upset that their children are using a curriculum developed by Nemours, a nonprofit children’s health system, which coaches teenagers through designing their own “healthy weight loss plan.” Such assignments are common for younger children too: My own first-grader was instructed to keep a fitness log for remote physical education last spring, and track how many minutes a day she moved and whether she did exercises like planks and situps. I didn’t blame the gym teacher, who was clearly struggling to figure out how to teach P.E. over Zoom. But it did get me wondering: Why do dieting and weight loss take center stage in so many school assignments? And what can parents do about it? School nutrition curriculums are usually written at the county or state level, and must be in accordance with the National Health Education Standards set out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the standards themselves are fairly open-ended, the C.D.C. also created the Health Education Curriculum Analysis Tool (known as HECAT) to help school districts make sure their curriculums meet the national standards. For nutrition, HECAT details specific curriculum objectives by age: By grade 2, for example, students should be able to “demonstrate effective refusal skills to avoid unhealthy food choices.” By grade 5, they should be able to “state personal beliefs to improve the food and beverage selections of others.” By grade 8, they should be able to “explain various methods available to evaluate body weight.” “HECAT is a disaster. We should not be teaching children to weigh themselves or eat to maintain or lose weight,” said Ganginis, who began advocating to change Maryland’s health curriculum after her then-kindergartner came home saying, “My teacher says I’m not allowed to bring potato chips anymore because we have to have a healthy snack.” Many adults would agree that potato chips are not as healthy as, say, apple slices, but what worried Ganginis was her daughter’s sadness and shame around liking a food that her teacher had deemed unhealthy.
