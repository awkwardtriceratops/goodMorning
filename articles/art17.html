By Kevin Draper ESPN will lay off 300 employees, about 6 percent of its worldwide staff, and let 200 open positions go unfilled, Jimmy Pitaro, the network’s chairman, told employees in a memo on Thursday. “Prior to the pandemic, we had been deeply engaged in strategizing how best to position ESPN for future success amidst tremendous disruption in how fans consume sports,” Pitaro wrote in a memo that was obtained by The New York Times. “The pandemic’s significant impact on our business clearly accelerated those forward-looking discussions.” The cuts will affect most divisions across the company, but are concentrated in broadcast production. Like many companies, ESPN’s business has been ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. ESPN will pay more than $7 billion for the rights to show live sports in 2020, the lifeblood of ESPN’s nine cable channels. But for four months this year, from March to July, there were almost no games to show. Even with the resumption of most professional and college sports, ESPN has faced low viewership and a sluggish advertising market. This is the latest in a string of layoffs for ESPN in recent years. About 300 employees were laid off in 2015, and about 250 were laid off in two waves in 2017, including a number of high-profile on-air employees. The layoffs come as ESPN continues to confront the long-term decline of pay television. The number of households paying for television peaked at 100.5 million in 2014; today that number is close to 80 million. While the timing and severity of the layoffs were driven by the pandemic, they are also a further reorientation toward a fully digital and streaming future. “Placing resources in support of our direct-to-consumer business strategy, digital, and, of course, continued innovative television experiences, is more critical than ever,” Pitaro wrote in the memo. In 2018, ESPN started ESPN+, a sports streaming service that costs $5 a month. At the end of June, ESPN+ had 8.5 million subscribers. Eighty percent of ESPN is owned by Disney. Sometimes its poor financial results can be buoyed by gains at Disney’s theme parks or movie divisions, or vice versa. But the pandemic has devastated nearly all of Disney’s business lines. Its theme parks worldwide were closed for months. Disneyland in California remains closed, while Disneyland Paris closed again as France entered a new lockdown. Few Americans are visiting movie theaters, wrecking Disney’s planned release schedule, and the production of movies and television shows has crawled to a standstill. Disney Cruise Line has suspended its cruises through the end of the year. In September, Disney laid off 28,000 employees, mostly at its two American theme parks. It announced a loss of $4.72 billion in the most recent quarter, covering April through June. Earnings in the company’s cable networks division, which is made up mostly of ESPN but also includes properties like the Disney Channel, were down 10 percent. Before the layoffs, ESPN had taken steps to reduce employee expenses. Some employees had been furloughed, and executives and highly-paid employees were asked to take pay cuts in recent months. While ESPN’s highest profile employees won’t be directly affected by these cuts, some on-air talent very likely will not have their contracts renewed when they expire, and others might see less lucrative contract extensions. According to a number of talent agents who insisted on anonymity so as not to harm their relationship with ESPN, the company is playing hardball in negotiations. In recent months, some on-air employees have signed extensions with a base salary of less than $50,000 and bonuses for each on-air appearance, when previously they had larger contracts that guaranteed a certain number of on-air appearances. During the pandemic, ESPN has broadcast more games remotely, with a limited number of personnel on-site and most functions done from one of the company’s broadcasting hubs in Bristol, Conn.; Los Angeles; New York; or Charlotte, N.C. This saves travel and employee costs, and at least some of the increased remote production is expected to continue even after ESPN believes it is safe to fully travel again. As the company cuts costs, it is looking toward possibly increasing its already outsized rights fee commitment. The N.F.L.’s contracts with television networks expire in 2021 and 2022, and ESPN is widely expected not only to bid to retain its “Monday Night Football” package, but also to bid on a package of Sunday games and to enter the Super Bowl rotation. ESPN’s broadcast contract with Major League Baseball expires soon, and it could look to bid on rights to N.H.L. games next year. ESPN is just the latest sports media property to undergo layoffs. Fox Sports laid off 50 to 100 employees over the summer, NBC Sports laid off around 75 employees at its regional sports networks and The Athletic laid off 46 people. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
