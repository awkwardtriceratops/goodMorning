Closure is not its goal.”Credit...Sanjay Suchak for The New York Times Supported by By Holland Cotter CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — “Can we forget the crack of the whip, cowhide, whipping-post, the auction-block, the hand-cuffs, the spaniels, the iron collar, the negro-trader tearing the young child from its mother’s breast as a whelp from the lioness? Have we forgotten that by these horrible cruelties, hundreds of our race have been killed? No, we have not, or ever will.” So wrote Isabella Gibbons, a formerly enslaved Black woman, two years after the end of the Civil War. She was writing here in Charlottesville, where, in the 1840s, she had worked as a cook at the University of Virginia, on a campus designed by Thomas Jefferson, third United States president, shaper of the Declaration of Independence, author of the words “all men are created equal,” and lifelong enslaver. Gibbons, who was owned by a university faculty member, a science professor, remained in Charlottesville after Emancipation. By the time she wrote, in 1867, she was a teacher in a Black primary school. She may well have continued to teach until her death in 1889, though the facts of her later life are uncertain. Indeed, her known story has come fully to light only in the 21st century with the university’s acknowledgment of the extent to which its material and ideological foundations rest on slavery. As a result of that acknowledgment, her resolute words now appear, carved in stone, on a new Memorial to Enslaved Laborers recently installed at the university. It’s composed of two concentric open carved-granite rings surrounding a circular patch of clipped grass. As with any abstract form, this one invites many readings. (Comparisons to a broken shackle and a ceremonial dance floor have been floated.) But it’s also embedded with hard factual data. The inner ring, low to the ground, carries an inscribed timeline of the lives of American enslaved people — with an emphasis on their presence at the university — from the early 17th century through Gibbons’s death in 1889. A channel cut into the wall is designed to send water flowing beneath and over the incised passages. Charlottesville is a city of monuments. One, a statue of Jefferson on the campus, was a rallying point, on the night of Aug. 11, 2017, for a large crowd of white supremacists gathering to protest the city’s plan to remove another monument, this one of the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, from a nearby park. When the rally reconvened the next day it was met by counterprotesters, some aligned with Black Lives Matter; in the melee a counterprotester was killed when a car plowed through the crowd. For generations, and with few exceptions, Americans have tended to ignore their old political monuments, tune them out as neutral features of the civic landscape, neither innocent, nor guilty; just there. The Charlottesville incident changed that. Suddenly, we saw certain images for what they were: ideological weapons, dirty bombs of history. The police killing of George Floyd in May opened our eyes still wider. If you want evidence, head to Richmond, Virginia’s capitol, an hour from Charlottesville. Drive down wide, stately Monument Avenue, famed for more than a century as an open-air museum of Jim Crow-era Confederate pride, and you’ll see the astonishing sight of what’s no longer there. In June, after the Floyd killing, protesters pulled down a statue of Jefferson Davis that had stood on the avenue since 1907. In July, a bronze figure of “Stonewall” Jackson was crane-lifted from its pedestal and trucked away to city storage. An equestrian sculpture of Lee still stands, pending a court decision, but its three-story-high base is bright with a rising tide of graffiti and ringed with Black Lives memorials like flowers in a garden. Corrective alternatives to these monuments are already in place. A sculptural tribute to the Richmond-born tennis star Arthur Ashe has stood on the avenue since 1996. And last December, a bronze equestrian figure titled “Rumors of War” by the contemporary African-American artist Kehinde Wiley was unveiled a few blocks away at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. Conceived as a response and rebuke to the cavalcade of white Confederate heroes, Mr. Wiley’s mounted warrior is a young Black man dressed in urban streetwear. When “Rumors of War” went on temporary display in Times Square last fall, it didn’t make much impact. Its positioning in Richmond near Monument Ave. enhances its critical bite. Yet whether, in the post-#MeToo present, any triumphalist male-warrior figure can automatically have positive political weight is a question. In Richmond, the Wiley piece comes across as being a little too close in spirit to the bellicose models it is meant to confront.
