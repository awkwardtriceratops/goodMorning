By Tyler Kepner The Tampa Bay Rays escaped from the brink on Saturday, reaching their second World Series with a 4-2 victory over the Houston Astros in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series in San Diego. The Rays, who had the A.L.’s best record in the abbreviated regular season, at 40-20,  had been in danger of joining the 2004 Yankees as the only teams in baseball history to lose a best-of-seven series after taking a 3-0 lead. But the Rays took an early lead and held off Houston, leaving the Boston Red Sox as the only team to complete such a comeback. “The Astros had all the momentum; it was up to us to change it around,” Rays Manager Kevin Cash said, adding later, “What it says about the club is, we’re a really good team and we can withstand some lumps. All good teams show the ability to rebound, and we did.” Tampa Bay’s only previous World Series appearance came in 2008, when the Rays fell in five games to the Philadelphia Phillies. They will face the winner of Game 7 of the National League Championship Series on Sunday between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Atlanta Braves. Though the Rays had dropped Games 4, 5 and 6, they had reason to be confident in Charlie Morton, their Game 7 starter. Morton is the team’s most experienced player, with 13 seasons in the majors, and he won Game 7 in the A.L.C.S. and in World Series in 2017 — when he was with the Astros, of all teams. He looked sharp on Saturday, working five and two-thirds innings while allowing two hits and striking out six. Randy Arozarena, the sport’s breakout October star, slammed a two-run homer off Lance McCullers Jr. in the first inning, giving him his seventh postseason home run — the most ever by a rookie. “We’ve been facing some great pitchers and some great teams,” Arozarena said through an interpreter. “But the ball’s looking good. The ball’s looking real nice to me.” Catcher Mike Zunino added a solo homer in the second inning and drove in another run with a sacrifice fly in the sixth — runs that proved crucial after the Astros scored twice in the eighth on a Carlos Correa single. The Rays also took a winner-take-all game in the division series, eliminating the Yankees despite an overwhelming difference in payrolls. The Yankees spend more on player salaries than any other team, while the Rays ranked 28th of 30 clubs this year, ahead of only Pittsburgh and Baltimore.
