A representative for Mr. Bridges did not immediately return a request for comment on Tuesday. Lymphoma, according to the Mayo Clinic, is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which helps the body fight germs. Mr. Bridges did not specify what his treatment entailed, but options vary based on the type and severity of the cancer, the clinic said. Those options can include chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiation therapy. Hodgkin’s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma are the two main subtypes of lymphoma. There will be more than 77,000 new cases of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2020, according to the National Cancer Institute, accounting for 4.3 percent of all new cancer cases.
