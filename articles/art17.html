Will They Help Him Win Again?<br></h1><p id="artcont">White evangelicals have time and again offered uncompromising support for President Trump when he needed it the most. By Elizabeth Dias Heather Way, who home-schools her three children in Waterville, Maine, said President Trump had proved to be “a man of his word.” Michael Poe, who works in the hazardous waste department of Gilbert, Ariz., said Mr. Trump aligned with his values, from economic to anti-abortion policy. Jonathan Thorne, a Southern Baptist youth pastor in Fayetteville, N.C., said Mr. Trump defended Christians, whose “rights are always being taken away.” All three are evangelical Christians. All say their support for Mr. Trump has grown even stronger since they voted for him four years ago. And all represent the white, Christian core of Mr. Trump’s base that he needs to hold in order to win on Tuesday, just as they pushed him to a surprise victory in 2016. “I think Trump’s going to win,” Mr. Thorne said. “I think that silent majority is going to pull it out for him, like they did in 2016.” At key moments for the past four years, conservative Christians have time and again offered their uncompromising support for Mr. Trump when he needed it most. They voted for him en masse in 2016, stood by him through policies like the ban on travel from several Muslim countries and the separation of families at the border, and championed his Supreme Court nominees. And although a number of coalitions that supported Mr. Trump’s win four years ago, like suburban women and rural voters, have appeared to fray, white Christians still overwhelmingly support him. About 80 percent of white evangelical voters support Mr. Trump, according to the latest polling, about the same as supported him in 2016. The share of white evangelicals who vote for Mr. Trump could potentially increase to 85 percent, said Robert P. Jones, whose Public Religion Research Institute has extensively polled the group. Mr. Jones also said that he did not detect any significant gender gap among white evangelicals — unlike the rest of the country — and that the idea Joseph R. Biden Jr. could shave off a significant portion of the demographic is unrealistic. “There’s no world in which Biden is going to get a quarter of white evangelical votes,” Mr. Jones said. “They look just so locked in.”
