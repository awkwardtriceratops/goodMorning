He was a Broadway performer who stood out, not just because he was 6 feet 5 inches tall, but also because he managed to charm castmates even while playing menacing characters — an abuser in “Waitress,” a mobster in “A Bronx Tale,” a gangster in “Bullets Over Broadway.” At “Bullets,” he met his future wife, Amanda Kloots, and scored a Tony nomination. The couple, with their infant son Elvis, moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 2019, where Cordero was performing in an immersive production of “Rock of Ages,” and Kloots was building a fitness business. In March, shortly after returning from a trip to New York, he got sick. Kloots, who had mastered social media while growing her business, chronicled his journey on Instagram, and hundreds of thousands of people followed along, with many joining her, virtually, in singing “Live Your Life,” a song Cordero had written, each afternoon. But his medical odyssey was unrelentingly tough — in April, a leg was amputated — and his suffering, alongside her determination, became, for many, a face of the pandemic. On July 5, he died. Kloots and Elvis, after months living in a guesthouse owned by “Bullets” co-star Zach Braff, have moved into the home where the couple had planned to make a new life in a new city. Instead, this month brought an online memorial and a posthumous album release. In a phone interview, Kloots, who is 38, was warm, poised and direct, breaking down only when asked how she saw her own future. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. What do you want Elvis to know about Nick? Oh, gosh. I want our son to be curious because Nick was very curious. I want him to know Nick struggled to make his dreams come true and he never quit. I want him to know his dad was a hard worker. And I’d love for him to know about all the people that he touched, the lives that he touched, and what a good guy he was.
