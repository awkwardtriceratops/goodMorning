Where they are private and controlled, he is an irreverent, emotional exhibitionist. Just look at the tape. By Matthew Futterman As the French Open moves to its final weekend, for the first time in years, the eyes of the tennis world are not solely trained on the 12-time champion, Rafael Nadal. Novak Djokovic, the No. 1 seed, is searching for absolution to bookend a year in which he drew most of his attention for questioning vaccinations, contracting the coronavirus at a poorly organized event and losing his temper at the United States Open, prompting his disqualification. Djokovic had been decimating his opponents with cruel efficiency before stiffness throughout his upper body slowed him down slightly in the quarterfinals on Wednesday against Pablo Carreño Busta. Djokovic won 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 to reach the semifinals, where on Friday he will play Stefanos Tsitsipas. But forehands and backhands are not what have landed him in the spotlight lately. The youngest and least predictable of the Big Three of men’s tennis — which includes Nadal and Roger Federer — Djokovic, 33, of Serbia, is an exhibitionist and tennis showman whose risks can turn into spectacles, both good and bad. Those qualities appeared to help during the quarterfinal on Philippe Chatrier court, as he unleashed his verbal fusillades at his coach, and cut loose with several primal, lung-busting screams to shake himself from an early funk. He did not handle things so well three weeks ago in New York. In the fourth round of the U.S. Open, also facing early frustration against Carreño Busta, Djokovic swatted a ball and accidentally nailed in the throat a line judge who was some 40 feet away. The incident led to his disqualification from the tournament, apologies and promises of both introspection and personal growth. Unlike his elite peers, Djokovic has long been comfortable with letting the public see him as something other than a tennis machine and dealing with the consequences.
