By Eliza Shapiro, Dana Rubinstein and Emma G. Fitzsimmons New York City is delaying the start of its school year by 10 days, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Tuesday, as part of a deal to avert a teachers’ strike and calm principals and parents anxious about the start of in-person classes. The city’s 1.1 million public schoolchildren will not have any in-person or remote classes until Sept. 21. The deal, which was hammered out during an overnight bargaining session between City Hall and the unions representing the city’s teachers and principals, is intended to give educators more time to prepare for the most closely watched reopening effort in the country. It is also meant to give the mayor a longer runway to pull off one of the most ambitious, and riskiest, city initiatives in decades.
