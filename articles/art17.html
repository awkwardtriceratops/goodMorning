By Charlie Brennan and Rick Rojas BOULDER, Colo. — She was driving back to her home in the Colorado mountains on Saturday when she saw the ominous plume swirling into the sky. In an instant, Jyoti Sharp’s mind went back to 2013, the last time she had been forced out by nature. Her home had been destroyed, as was much of Jamestown, the 280-person community where she lives. Then, the town had been wiped out by Colorado’s worst flood in a generation. This time, it was a swiftly growing wildfire at the end of a long and brutal season that had her packing to leave the house she had rebuilt and moved into just four months earlier. “My heart was beating fast,” Ms. Sharp, 64, said of how she felt on Saturday as she recalled fleeing the flood with a single suitcase she happened to have packed for her son’s wedding. “My breathing was shallow. I had to keep reminding myself to breathe.” The fire started on Saturday in the woodlands near Jamestown, a late arrival in a season that would normally be nearing its end but still rages in Colorado, straining firefighting resources to their limit and signaling for scientists another devastating consequence of rising temperatures in a changing climate. Already, firefighters are battling to contain the Cameron Peak Fire, which has burned since August and grown into the largest fire recorded in Colorado history. On Sunday, it eclipsed 200,000 acres. And the latest fire spread rapidly, engulfing more than 8,000 acres by Sunday. “It just exploded,” Mike Wagner, division chief for the Boulder County Sheriff’s Department, said in a briefing late Saturday. “It’s been so dry and just such high fire danger combined with lack of firefighting resources because of the number of fires not only in Colorado but across the West.” Millions of acres have been scorched by wildfires in Western states this year, burning homes and businesses as they invaded communities and killed people who were unable to escape the flames. The fires have also showered ash upon communities beyond their direct path and cast a haze that darkened skies across the region. In California, lightning storms ignited hundreds of blazes, some of which grew into the largest in modern state history. More than 8,500 wildfires have burned over 4.1 million acres in California, state fire officials said, killing at least 31 people. More than a million acres also burned in Oregon and Washington.
