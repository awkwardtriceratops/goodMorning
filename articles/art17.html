By Tracey Tully and Michael Gold TRENTON — The neighbors gathered outside a blue-and-white building in Trenton on Wednesday morning, coming together in shock, anger and grief on a block filled with abandoned homes just two miles from New Jersey’s gilded State House. They came to mourn what they said was another senseless act of violence in a city that has been plagued by them this year. And they came to vent their fury that little had been done to halt the spree. But this killing felt especially brutal given the victims: two young brothers who were slain by bullets shot into their home on Tuesday night. “The children did not deserve to be at the other end of a barrel,” Mayor Reed Gusciora said at a news conference on Wednesday. “And we have to do better as a community to make sure that this does not happen again.” The victims — Gustavo Perez, 16, and Johnny Perez, 8 — were the latest killed in a surge of homicides this year in New Jersey’s capital, a city where many struggle to make ends meet in one of the nation’s wealthiest states. For months, officials and residents in Trenton have been overwhelmed by a spike in violent crime, which many other cities around the country are also grappling with. With about 10 weeks left in the year, Trenton, a city of about 84,000 people, has seen 34 homicides — more than double its total from last year, when 15 people were killed. The city is also close to matching its deadliest year on record; in 2013, 37 people were killed in homicides, according to State Police data. But the death of the two brothers deepened the pain and frustration felt by residents of the East Trenton neighborhood they called home. “How do you kill an 8-year-old child?” asked Leroy Hayes, 64, a neighborhood fixture and handyman. “This neighborhood is just killing after killing after killing, and nobody’s doing nothing.” At least one shooter fired multiple rounds, apparently from the street into the home, striking the two brothers, officials said. Neither the suspected gunman nor a possible motive have been publicly identified. But the city’s police director, Sheilah Coley, said at a news conference that detectives believed the house had been targeted. Mr. Gusciora said the authorities were investigating whether the killings were connected to a family gathering that had taken place in front of the house before the shooting. “We’re at a loss of what transpired at the family gathering, or whether this is gang-related or family-related,” Mr. Gusciora said. The gunfire left a single bullet hole in a second-story window facing the road.
