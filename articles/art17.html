The incident caused an uproar over racial disparities in such arrests. By Ashley Southall A New York City police officer facing misconduct charges for kneeling on a bystander’s neck during a social-distancing arrest has retired, according to the victim’s lawyer and the officer’s labor union. The officer, Francisco X. Garcia, was scheduled to appear at a departmental hearing this week on misconduct charges stemming from the May 2 incident, which fueled an uproar over racial disparities in how the police enforced social-distancing measures. But instead, Officer Garcia retired on Tuesday, avoiding proceedings that could be used against him in a criminal investigation of the incident underway in the Manhattan district attorney’s office. Officer Garcia, 32, refused to comment on Wednesday. His decision to leave the force was first reported Wednesday by the New York Daily News. A police official confirmed that Officer Garcia had retired and would no longer face a disciplinary hearing.
