By Brian F. Schaffner, Jesse H. Rhodes and Raymond J. La Raja The authors are political scientists and the authors of “Hometown Inequality: Race, Class, and Representation in American Local Politics.” In the wake of the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, cities and towns across the nation erupted in mass protests against police violence and systemic racism. While the national news media — and President Trump’s ire — has focused, in the main, on the huge marches in major cities like Minneapolis and Portland, Ore., there is an untold story happening in the heartland and suburbs of America, where the majority of African-Americans actually live. Although political inequality by race is widespread in our big cities, it is actually much worse in suburban and rural towns throughout America. In research we have conducted over the past five years, we examined how well different racial and ethnic groups are represented by their local elected officials. Our study covers a random sample of more than 500 communities, from some of the largest American cities to towns of just a few hundred residents. At every level, the story is largely the same: African-Americans typically receive worse representation on their city and town councils than whites do. This pattern holds even in communities where Black residents are a majority of the population. The accompanying chart shows how white and Black Americans compare on the main measure of representation used in our research: the ideological distance between elected officials and community residents. In other words, we looked at the degree to which the overall preferences of groups of citizens diverge from those of the political leaders of the community. When this value is smaller, the group’s views are better represented by their local officials; when it is larger, representation is worse. Black Americans are less ideologically similar to their local elected officials compared to whites.
