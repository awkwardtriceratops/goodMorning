By Sydney Franklin Some New Yorkers who have moved out of the city since the beginning of the pandemic headed to the suburbs, but not to a typical suburban life. Instead of a house with a picket fence and a front yard, many urbanites have opted to rent in newly developed apartment buildings or to buy condominiums in denser, walkable suburban communities, where apartments tend to be bigger and offer more outdoor space than comparable units in the city. The increased traffic from city dwellers surprised developers at first, but it quickly became clear that many New Yorkers were hoping to secure what they felt would be a safer, short-term future outside the borders of the city. “Back in April, the narrative of this outbound migration to the suburbs was anecdotal,” said James Fitzpatrick, division president for luxury home builder Toll Brothers. “But over the past three months, that’s now become real and measurable for us.” Sales on single-family homes in the suburbs spiked when the pandemic began in March. Many families fled New York in search of temporary rental homes or permanent second homes where parents could work remotely, children could attend online classes and everyone could enjoy the summer with sufficient social distancing. New Yorkers who chose to leave the city for a new apartment or condominium, however, had different priorities, namely an affordable and active lifestyle — two things that a locked-down New York no longer offered. “Affordability became paramount almost overnight,” said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers & Consultants. “Covid-19 removed, in the short term, a lot of the things in New York that make it the reason to be there.” Nowhere is this shift more visible than in the suburbs of northeastern New Jersey. Until the pandemic, Hudson County, which includes Hoboken and Jersey City, was the top-performing real estate market in the state, according to Jeffrey Otteau, president and founder of Otteau Group, a real estate analytics and appraisal firm. But demand for condos, a popular market in this part of New Jersey, dropped by 13 percent from January through August of this year. The rental market there also suffered as people moved farther out into the state. Now, there are over 1,300 fewer occupied apartments in the area. The rental market just beyond Hudson County, however, is a different story. Across the state’s 19 more suburban counties, new apartment complexes have popped up to take on demand.
