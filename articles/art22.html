Will Again Delay Start of In-Person Classes for Most Students<br></h1><p id="artcont">The city had scheduled classes to start on Monday. Now, students will be allowed to return on a rolling basis, beginning with those in pre-K. TRANSCRIPT So here is the updated approach we will take, and it involves several phases. They move quickly and therefore we’ll be able to serve children and families well. But they will include some adjustments compared to the previous schedule. So here’s what we’ll do. Beginning this Monday Sept. 21, three-K and pre-K early education sites will be open, pre-K and three-K classrooms will be open, District 75 schools, schools that serve our special education kids, kids who need a lot of support and love, those schools will be open. We then will have the next phase on Tuesday, Sept. 29, when K through 5 schools and K through 8 schools will open. And then on Thursday, Oct. 1, middle schools and high schools will open. Now this means the in-person learning, obviously remote learning has begun already. The orientations have begun, remote learning will continue throughout for all students as these phases come into play.
