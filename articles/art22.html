Also: Oil leasing in the Arctic refuge; Lori Loughlin’s jail sentence; prisoner firefighters; Trump donors. To the Editor: Re “Learning to Love Joe Biden” (column, Aug. 16): Jennifer Senior gives us a cleareyed mini-portrait of Joe Biden, and then ends her piece with a cleareyed question: If Joe Biden doesn’t win, could we survive his loss? Because I believe that the survival of America as a democratic nation, and the survival of the planet as ecologically sustainable, will be at great risk if he loses, I am working extremely hard for him and Kamala Harris. He wasn’t my first, second or even third choice in the primaries, and I don’t “love” him. But if he is elected, I believe he will surround himself with a top-flight group of advisers, and an extremely competent and honest cabinet and administration — which would be the exact opposite of what we have been forced to endure since Jan. 20, 2017. I will be able to take deep breaths once again, knowing that while mistakes will undoubtedly be made, they will come from the best of, rather than the most corrupt, intentions. Richard J. Brenner
Miller Place, N.Y. To the Editor: Re “U.S. Plans to Auction Oil Leases as Arctic Protections End” (news article, Aug. 18): Of all the abhorrent acts in President Trump’s “Little Shop of Horrors” presidency, auctioning oil leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska is among the worst. We can fix the Postal Service; we can change immigration and tax laws; we can streamline our response to Covid-19 based on science. But once this pristine area is overwhelmed with oil rigs, trucks and human detritus, it is lost forever. And oil is a fuel that we are phasing out in order to save the planet, so the only justification for despoiling a national treasure for future generations is so that a few people can make a lot of money. Sadly, this is the philosophical essence of Mr. Trump’s reign. If we are lucky, the process will not play out quickly enough, and President Joe Biden can shut it down. We can hope! Carol Kraines
Deerfield, Ill. To the Editor: Re “‘Full House’ Actress Gets Two Months in College Admissions Scandal” (news article, Aug. 22): As a passionate advocate for educational justice and a prison abolitionist, I can’t say I’m thrilled with Lori Loughlin’s jail sentence. Instead of sending Ms. Loughlin to jail, the judge should have sent her back to high school. Actually doing the work required to get into the University of Southern California — getting high grades, participating in extracurriculars and acing the SATs — would give her better appreciation for why her actions are not just illegal, but also unethical.

Brewster, Mass. To the Editor: Re “A Wary California Released Inmate Firefighters. Now, Fires Rage” (front page, Aug. 23): I grew up in Santa Cruz, and my family and friends still live there. I have also spent the last 20 years of my life trying to end the war on drugs and reduce the number of people behind bars who shouldn’t be there. I find it incredibly ironic and hypocritical that California would use and depend on the labor of people behind bars, have them risk their lives to put out fires, while paying them a measly couple of dollars. Not to mention that the same people we depend on to fight these fires, and others who are incarcerated, are treated terribly and inhumanely so much of the other time. If we are happy to use their skills when they are behind bars, why not pay them a decent wage and hire them now that they are out of prison? There is no reason to fly in firefighters from around the world when people who are currently or formerly incarcerated have experience and are in California. Paying a real salary to the incarcerated firefighters would be a positive step to make up for the exploitation of their work from before. It would also be a win-win both for them and the people of California who need their skills to help save their homes. Tony Newman
Brooklyn To the Editor: Re “Trump’s Campaign Coffers Low on Big-Dollar Checks” (front page, Aug. 17): It’s not surprising that millionaire and billionaire donations to President Trump’s re-election campaign have tapered off. Yes, he promised — and provided — billions in tax cuts for the wealthiest. But the rich like to bet on the winner. And even billionaires need a competent government so they don’t have to bury their relatives, shut their businesses and suffer losses when their employees and customers are homebound. Mangling public health and the economy disproportionately devastates poor families. Ultimately, however, disdain for government hurts us all. Amy Hanauer
