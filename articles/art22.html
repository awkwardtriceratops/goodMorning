By Billy Witz As Justin Fields, the star quarterback at Ohio State, was gathering more than 300,000 electronic signatures to beseech Big Ten university presidents to reverse their decision to postpone football this fall, he was applauded by his coach, Ryan Day, who in turn was being hailed by his athletic director, Gene Smith. Nobody, though, was cheering on Dr. Curt Daniels. Daniels, the director of sports cardiology at Ohio State, had also been busy, working to publish a three-month study whose preliminary findings were presented to Pac-12 and Big Ten leaders before they shut down football earlier this month. Daniels said that cardiac M.R.I.s, an expensive and sparingly used tool, revealed an alarmingly high rate of myocarditis — heart inflammation that can lead to cardiac arrest with exertion — among college athletes who had recovered from the coronavirus. The survey found myocarditis in close to 15 percent of athletes who had the virus, almost all of whom experienced mild or no symptoms, Daniels added, perhaps shedding more light on the uncertainties about the short- and long-term effects the virus may have on athletes. But as Daniels’s survey awaits the rigors of peer review, it has received scant attention, in part because Ohio State has refused to make public any testing data about its athletes — who make up the bulk of the study — other than to announce last month that it had shut down workouts because of positive virus tests. Thus, Daniels said he could not disclose any more information about the data, including the number of athletes tested and those found with myocarditis, until it is published. (The school has said it is following privacy laws, but those prohibit only the disclosure of personally identifiable information.) What is taking place at Ohio State — mixed messages, competing agendas and a lack of transparency — is playing out on a broader scale across the country as college football’s powerhouse conferences decide whether to go forth with a fall season, with a shutdown risking billions in television and ticket revenue. Those who have pushed toward playing have done so with little or no public health justification, and despite widespread pronouncements earlier this year that if students could not sit in classrooms, they could not play sports. Last week, North Carolina, North Carolina State and Notre Dame, which will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference this season, backed off in-person instruction because of virus outbreaks, but encouraged their football teams to stay on campus. While some players in the Southeastern Conference used social media to criticize students for not wearing masks in classrooms, bars or fraternity houses, its schools were busy announcing plans to have upward of 25,000 fans at games — even at Alabama, where a vice president told students Friday the university was on a pace to run out of isolation beds by the end of the month. And a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic who advised the Big 12 and Conference U.S.A. to soldier on with football said in a podcast that any conference that did not play because of myocarditis concerns was relying on “wimpy, wobbly, weak” evidence. Nowhere, though, has there been more conflict than in the Big Ten, where it took Commissioner Kevin Warren eight days — and the prospect of angry parents demonstrating outside the conference’s offices — to issue a letter that summarized the medical criteria upon which the presidents based their decision not to play. Warren has also had to beat back complaints from his own member universities.
