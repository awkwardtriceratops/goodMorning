Now, we are excited to announce a relaunch of the podcast at The New York Times, hosted by Daniel Jones and Miya Lee. Each week, they’ll bring you their favorite stories, conversations with the authors and a few surprises. The season kicks off on Oct. 14, with new episodes every Wednesday. DANIEL JONES is the founding editor of the Modern Love column. When it began in 2004, he was told the column might last a year or two (maybe three), so he basically has been unprepared for everything that’s happened in the 16 years since, including working on the Modern Love TV show and hosting this podcast. He lives in Western Massachusetts and New York City. Find him on Twitter at @danjonesnyt. MIYA LEE is the editor of Modern Love projects. When the column began, she was in third grade. She started working for Modern Love as a submission reader when she was in college. Now, she evaluates essay submissions, selects and edits Tiny Love Stories and is involved in all aspects of the franchise. Born and raised in New York City, Miya lives in Brooklyn. Find her on Twitter at @yayamilee. Hosted by: Daniel Jones and Miya Lee
