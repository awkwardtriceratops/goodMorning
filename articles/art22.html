By Ayana Mathis THE SADDEST WORDS
William Faulkner’s Civil War
By Michael Gorra In July, at his memorial service at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the Honorable John Lewis was eulogized by three presidents. The sitting president was not among them. His absence was yet another assertion of the anti-Black hostility and xenophobia fouling the polity with renewed vigor. We lament the current social climate as though it were anomalous, an outbreak of pestilence, when in reality these iniquities reverberate through our American centuries. We need a prophet — a voice to call up the nation’s oldest stories, a reckoning with what was so that we might understand what is. In “The Saddest Words: William Faulkner’s Civil War,” part literary biography, part Civil War history, Michael Gorra presents a cogent case for Faulkner as one such prophet. Gorra’s premise is this: Through the spectacular specificity of Faulkner’s novels set in his invented Yoknapatawpha County, he “tells about the South,” as he wrote in “Absalom, Absalom!” — from the King Cotton years of slavery, through the Civil War and into the 20th century. In so doing, Faulkner tells America. Faulkner’s work, Gorra writes, “contains the richest gallery of characters in all of American literature, and in his handling of time and consciousness Faulkner stands as one of his century’s most restless experimenters.” The magnitude of Faulkner’s subject matter is matched only by the immensity of his gifts.
