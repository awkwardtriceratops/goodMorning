By Jennifer Medina One of the most memorable speakers of the first night of the Democratic National Convention was a woman whom many voters had never heard of: Kristin Urquiza, whose father, a supporter of President Trump’s, died of the coronavirus in Phoenix in June, not long after Arizona lifted many of its stay-at-home restrictions. “My dad was a healthy 65-year-old,” she said during the convention. “His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump — and for that he paid with his life.” In May, Ms. Urquiza, 39, graduated with a master’s degree in public policy from the University of California, Berkeley, and had planned to continue her work with international environmental policy. But the death of her father, Mark Anthony Urquiza, has prompted her to turn her focus on the impact of the coronavirus crisis in the United States. After writing a blistering obituary, in which she blamed the country’s leaders for her father’s death, and holding a vigil at the Arizona State Capitol on the day of his funeral, Ms. Urquiza garnered national attention, including from Democratic strategists. Already, her words are being featured in two political advertisements targeting voters in several swing states. The New York Times spoke with her about her family’s politics — her father, she noted, voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 — and what she planned to do in the weeks leading up to the presidential election. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Q. The circumstances that led to your speech were clearly tragic. What was your family’s experience with the coronavirus crisis? A. My dad woke up on June 11 feeling sick. My mom called me right away and started to list symptoms, and I immediately thought it was Covid. I was terrified. I’m an only child and I was really focused on taking care of my parents. We got him a test the next day, but he never got the results because he quickly deteriorated. Really in that moment, the other thing I remember immediately thinking is, This shouldn’t be happening. We knew about this virus, but we didn’t have a national mask mandate. That’s what I remember feeling so deep in my core, that this was a colossal failure of leadership that has put my dad’s life at risk. He went into the hospital on June 16, went into the I.C.U. on June 26 and passed on June 30. During that time, my mom ended up testing positive as well, so my dad was so terrified. Luckily, she didn’t get as sick as my father — she had extreme exhaustion and some other symptoms. But he was texting from his hospital bed while he was dealing with his own fight, saying we have to get ahead of this. It was terrifying. The day before he went to the I.C.U., he was telling me he thought he was going to be home on Monday. This virus can just decimate people so quickly. The doctor I spoke to didn’t expect my dad to take the turn that he did. I live in San Francisco, and I was making the calculation of “Do I go home?” trying to think about mitigating my own risk. It was a lot, it required a colossal amount of resiliency. When my dad passed, I was driving home to Phoenix; I took the phone call on the side of the highway at a gas station. I still can’t believe how it happened. But the thing that really inspired me to be honest was when I talked to aunts and uncles, I saw the same anger I had. Tell us more about your father — what was he like? He worked in aerospace manufacturing, making sure the parts coming off the line met the specifications. He had been working for a long time and was an essential worker so was continuing [to work] during the shelter-in-place. But his company lost a big contract and he was furloughed in April. He was a huge lover of karaoke. He could not carry a tune to save his life, but he did it with gusto. He came from a big, close-knit family — he was one of six. He was an informal promoter to bring people together to celebrate anything. So I know that when a friend of his had a birthday and things were open, he was eager to meet up with friends and catch up with them. He felt it was safe to go out. I counseled him that it’s not actually safe, but he said, “Why would the governor say it was safe when it isn’t?” You spoke about your father’s vote for Mr. Trump — how much did the two of you discuss politics? He was a Republican for most of his life. I just learned recently that when my parents got married, my mom was a registered Republican and he was a Democrat, but he said, “Well, I’ll be a Republican so we don’t cancel each other out.” I think my dad over time became very loyal to the party. He was an enthusiastic supporter of Trump. He liked that he was a businessman. He thought that he would bring a fresh perspective to his position. My entire life I never saw eye to eye with the Republican Party, but in particular, the last few years. My dad and I talked constantly about politics. It was always very cordial. It was kind of fun to test out ideas with him, because I knew he would always be a friendly audience and encourage me to fight for what I believed in. My dad’s father was from Mexico, and everyone else in his family is a Democrat. Immigration is one the of the topics I have been really passionate about and outraged at Republicans about. But my dad didn’t go so deep on that. When he was in this hospital, we ended up talking about politics. I asked him, “What do you think now?” He told me that he felt sideswiped and betrayed by what was happening. I didn’t have the heart to dig in further, but there was a part of me that wanted to. I didn’t want him to feel like he was doing something wrong. My dad was following what he was told by people who are supposed to be leaders. We had multiple conversations when basically what I was hearing from him was a parroting that I knew to be incorrect. That is part of what is so frustrating about this entire situation. We are living in a moment of time where there is a crisis and people are muddled in so much misinformation that we are drowning in a way that prevents us from protecting ourselves. My parents did a really good job of keeping me safe when I was a kid, and it’s part of my responsibility to do the same for them now. But it’s not a white, sketchy van that says “free candy” on it to be afraid of; it’s not even just the coronavirus. It’s important to be direct about what we’re facing and what we’re up against. People need leadership to keep them safe. How did you make the decision to turn grief into advocacy? I saw people in the neighborhood I grew up in waiting in line for hours for [Covid] tests in 107-degree heat — predominantly immigrants, predominantly Latinx. If I didn’t speak out, I didn’t know who would. It has been not just for me, but also for my broader community. When we fail, it is landing on the shoulders of people on the front lines, on the communities that are already living on the margins. Our lives deserve to be prioritized. Governor [Doug] Ducey was lock step with Trump on reopening quickly — that caused a spike across the country. I was not comfortable to have him with blood on his hands without being open about that. I felt it was my patriotic duty to be honest with you. I saw the response from AIDS activists as a model. This isn’t about me; this is for people who don’t have the opportunity to speak out, to tell their story. When I look at videos of me at the first vigil, I am reconnected with the anger and rage that I felt. I can only relate it to a summer storm in the desert, with wind and dust and lightning and rain. If I didn’t channel that into something productive, I was terrified I would implode. So by leaning into the advocacy, I couldn’t save my dad’s life, but I could potentially have that sort of higher purpose.
