By Carole Landry and Hiroko Masuike (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Republicans renominated President Trump on the first day of their convention. Mr. Trump, making his case for re-election as the Republican National Convention kicked off in Charlotte, N.C., continued to attack mail-in voting and leveled unfounded accusations of misconduct against Democrats. “They’re using Covid to steal the election,” he said in an inflammatory speech after his nomination as the party’s presidential candidate in the November election. Above, Mr. Trump speaking to delegates in Charlotte earlier today. Vice President Mike Pence told delegates “the economy is on the ballot.” We have live updates here. Despite rising coronavirus rates, job losses and vanishing savings, Mr. Trump’s approval ratings on the economy remain durable. Our reporter looked at the factors raising the president’s standing on the economy. The convention’s program is heavy on all things Trump, with an appearance by the president every night in prime time, and a lineup featuring Melania Trump and all of the president’s adult children. Tonight, the speakers include Nikki Haley and Donald Trump Jr. Here’s what to watch for. The Times will stream the convention every evening, Monday through Thursday. Join our political reporters for live analysis starting at 8:30 p.m. Eastern. 2. Another U.S. city is reeling after the police shooting of a Black man. Jacob Blake, 29, was in stable condition in a hospital on Monday, a day after he was shot in the back as he tried to get into his car in Kenosha, Wis., a city on the shore of Lake Michigan.
