Gov. John Fetterman, said a woman taunted her at a grocery store. Ms. Fetterman shared video of the confrontation on Twitter. By Johnny Diaz Gisele Barreto Fetterman, the wife of Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor, went to the grocery store on Sunday to pick up some golden kiwis. It was a last-minute dash, so she headed to a local Aldi store without the state troopers who usually protect her. Three boxes of kiwis in hand, Ms. Fetterman was standing in line to pay when a woman stopped and stared at her. “‘Oh, there is that N-word that Fetterman married,’” Ms. Fetterman recalled the woman saying to her, emphasizing in a phone interview on Monday that the woman used the racial slur without abbreviating it. Ms. Fetterman is the wife of Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat. Ms. Fetterman, who shared an account of the encounter in a tweet on Sunday night, said she froze. The woman kept repeating, “You don’t belong here,” before walking away, she said. Shaken, Ms. Fetterman paid for her produce and headed to her car. The woman reappeared, pulling down her purple mask and repeating the racial slur to Ms. Fetterman, who recorded the encounter and shared it with her followers on social media. Word of the encounter spread just three weeks before a presidential election in which Pennsylvania is set to reprise its role as an important battleground state. President Trump, who won the state by fewer than 45,000 votes in 2016, is now trailing former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in nearly every poll. The partisan rancor remains intense, particularly around issues of racial unrest and coronavirus restrictions. Ms. Fetterman’s husband and Gov. Tom Wolf, both Democrats, have clashed with Republicans openly defying stay-at-home orders, mask mandates and other efforts to stop the spread of the disease.
