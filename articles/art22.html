Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency, and the California National Guard will assist with relief efforts. By Azi Paybarah and Christina Morales Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency Tuesday in response to wildfires in California, as the state gave evacuation orders and battled the effects of a sweltering heat wave, rolling blackouts and the coronavirus pandemic. By early Wednesday morning, the state fire authorities had ordered residents to evacuate in parts of Santa Cruz, San Mateo, Napa and Sonoma Counties, in Northern California, where thunderstorms brought lightning strikes this week. The largest fire in the region, called the SCU Lightning Complex, had spread to 35,000 acres in several counties east of San Jose and was 4 percent contained. Another fire, called the LNU Lightning Complex fire, was quickly growing north of the Bay Area, with 32,000 acres burned by about 9:30 Tuesday night. That fire forced evacuations in parts of Napa and Sonoma, with the authorities warning of an “immediate threat to life” in some places. Local news outlets showed structures consumed by flames in Vacaville, about 35 miles southwest of Sacramento, and fire overtaking a camera meant to help spot wildfires on Mount Vaca. Photos and videos on social media showed flames lapping at the road and, in the hours before dawn, some images showed a glowing red sky, as the fire lit up dense smoke. To the south, residents in Oakland and San Francisco could smell smoke as they woke up on Wednesday morning. The authorities around Northern California warned of poor air quality in addition to the rising heat. The governor’s emergency declaration  makes resources available to fight dozens of wildfires that are burning throughout the state and have been aggravated by the heat and sustained high winds, his office said. Lightning strikes have also sparked fires throughout the state. “We are deploying every resource available to keep communities safe as California battles fires across the state during these extreme conditions,” Mr. Newsom said in a statement. “California and its federal and local partners are working in lock step to meet the challenge and remain vigilant in the face of continued dangerous weather conditions.” [Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.] The  fires throughout the state have stressed the state’s mutual aid system, which has made it difficult for jurisdictions to obtain the firefighting resources they need, according to the emergency proclamation. The declaration enables Mr. Newsom to mobilize resources from out of state, a top aide to the governor said in an interview Tuesday night. The governor also mobilized the California National Guard to assist with relief efforts. Even as some residents prepared to evacuate or fled their homes as fires approached, Californians around the state braced for more rolling blackouts during a heat wave. On Monday, Mr. Newsom demanded an investigation into why state regulators had failed to prepare for high temperatures, which had been forecast for days. On Wednesday, the temperature was expected to reach near 100 degrees Fahrenheit in Napa and Sonoma, and to rise as high as 106 degrees in Sacramento. Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for the state’s office of emergency services, said that the declaration would also ease regulations to help get assistance to those in need. Examples he cited included the waiving of fees to replace driver’s licenses, birth certificates and marriage licenses for those affected by the fires. The declaration has no impact on health restrictions related to the coronavirus response, he said. Over the past week, portions of Monterey, Nevada and Napa Counties have declared mandatory emergency evacuations for thousands of residents as the counties battled several fires. And the state has been battling wildfires for weeks: The Apple fire, which spread across more than 30,000 acres in Southern California this month, forcing thousands to evacuate their homes, was 95 percent contained Tuesday. “We are asking that everyone continue to respect the orders and warnings as this fire is still very active,” Sheriff Shannan Moon of Nevada County said Tuesday as she addressed residents about the Jones fire.
