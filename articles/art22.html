By Luis Ferré-Sadurní and Jesse McKinley Lovely Warren, the Rochester, N.Y., mayor whose leadership has come under attack after her administration mishandled the death of a Black man who had been placed in a hood by the police, was indicted on Friday on two unrelated felony campaign finance charges. The two-page indictment charges Ms. Warren, a Democrat, and two associates with two campaign finance violations related to when she was running for a second term in 2017. Sandra Doorley, the Monroe County district attorney, said Ms. Warren participated in “a scheme to defraud” related to her official campaign fund and a political action committee working to help her get re-elected. The indictment accused Ms. Warren, as well as her campaign treasurer and Rochester’s finance director, of “knowingly and willfully” working to evade contribution limits as well as engaging in “a systemic and ongoing course of conduct with the intent to defraud more than one person.” “We all want our elections to be run fairly, and these are laws on the books to allow and ensure that people who are entering political office follow the rules,” Ms. Doorley said at a news conference on Friday as she revealed the criminal charges. “We all want fair campaigns.” Joseph Damelio, a lawyer for Ms. Warren, said the mayor had known about the investigation for several years, and was eager to prove her innocence. “Her position has not changed one bit, and that is, she’s innocent,” he said, adding, “She is anxious to get this process started and she’s ready to go to trial.” The grand-jury indictment adds yet another layer of crisis to a city in turmoil ever since the death of Daniel Prude became public, with protesters taking to the streets over another death of a Black person because of an encounter with the police. Mr. Prude died in March of suffocation after his arrest by Rochester police officers, but his death did not become public until his family obtained and released body-cam footage of the incident in September. The footage showed officers placing a hood over Mr. Prude’s head after he was apparently spitting and claiming he had the coronavirus, with one officer using much of his weight to push down on the prone man’s head. Mr. Prude had to be resuscitated, and died a week later at a hospital. The footage was quickly followed by revelations that city officials stopped the body-cam footage from becoming public. The subsequent scandal and accusations of a cover-up led the Rochester police chief to step down and escalated calls for Ms. Warren to resign. Letitia James, New York’s attorney general, whose office had been quietly investigating Mr. Prude’s death since mid-April, announced last month that she would set up a grand jury to consider evidence. Ms. Warren, first elected in 2013, is the first female and second African-American mayor of Rochester, a city of about 200,000 people in Western New York. She would be removed from office if she was convicted of the felony. The investigation into her campaign finances had dogged her since two candidates who unsuccessfully ran against her in 2017 complained to the state Board of Elections. A subsequent investigation by the board led to a March report that Ms. Doorley said found “considerable evidence” of possible crimes. At issue are transfers made from Ms. Warren’s political action committee to her campaign committee that far exceeded the $8,557 limit that a campaign could receive from an individual donor, the Democrat and Chronicle of Rochester reported. That limit also applied to the political action committee. Ms. Warren, 43, whose term ends next year, has strongly denied any wrongdoing, describing the transfers as unintentional errors, and dismissing the investigation as a “political witch hunt.” On Friday, Ms. Doorley asserted otherwise, noting there was a “substantial” amount of money involved in the scheme. “This is not political,” said Ms. Doorley, a Republican. “We assert by this indictment that this is allegedly a scheme to defraud.” The mayor is scheduled to be arraigned on Monday afternoon, along with her co-defendants, Albert Jones Jr., the campaign treasurer, and Rosiland Brooks Harris, the finance director. In remarks on Friday, Mr. Damelio, the lawyer for Ms. Warren, suggested that the recent unrest in Rochester — including protesters calling for Ms. Warren’s resignation — may have made grand jurors more likely to bring charges against her. “That’s something we were aware of, something we were concerned about,” he said.   Ms. Warren has previously blamed any irregularities in her campaign finances on poor bookkeeping. Ms. Doorley saw it differently: “The indictment alleges that this was not a mistake,” she said. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
