By Brian Stelter Mr. Stelter is the author of “Hoax: Donald Trump, Fox News, and the Dangerous Distortion of Truth." The Trump era is the hoax era. But not in the way he or his cheerleaders claim. Donald Trump has shouted “hoax” hundreds of times, about everything from climate change to Supreme Court rulings to impeachment. At this point, his copious claims about hoaxes add up to a hoax. And through the history of his use of this single word, we can see how he has fooled his biggest fans but failed to persuade almost everyone else. During his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump didn’t rely on the word “hoax.” He didn’t even say “fake news.” He called the news media “sick” and biased, but he didn’t seriously start to deny its legitimacy until January 2017, when he was confronted by evidence that the Russian government aided his election. That’s when he truly needed the news to be fake. Looking back, Mr. Trump’s exploitation of the term “fake news” to smear journalists was the single most consequential thing he did during the transition period. He built the scaffolding for his supporters to reject any and all information that wasn’t Trump-approved. After a few months, when “fake news” lost its power through sheer repetition, Mr. Trump introduced something far more sinister: a hoax. Something can be “fake news” by accident — a typo in a quote, a mistake made on deadline — but a hoax is malicious. Well before becoming president, Mr. Trump had used the word a few times — to dismiss global warming, for instance. It’s “a total, and very expensive, hoax!” he tweeted in 2013. But his “hoax” hoax began in earnest in April 2017, when he told The Times that “the Russia story” — that it intervened in the 2016 election — “is a total hoax.”
