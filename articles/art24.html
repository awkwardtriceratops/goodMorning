Now there’s a segment on Biden’s history with the military. It’s really remarkable how much this night is really about one thing: Biden’s character. It’s such a contrast to last night, which was very policy heavy. Jill Biden said that Biden has talked about a “sacred obligation” to take care of veterans, and she says taking care of military families will be a “priority” in a Biden administration. This is a significant point, given that Republicans have historically pointed to the military as evidence of strength. Up next, Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois. Duckworth was a top contender for V.P. She’s a veteran who lost both of her legs in combat.  Her story is remarkable. And listening to her tell it is a high point of this evening. Duckworth introduced Beau Biden at the 2008 Democratic convention. A real interesting part of our colleagues’ great V.P. reporting was how much the Biden campaign was scared a judge might rule Duckworth ineligible because she was born in Thailand.  Duckworth said the U.S. military has a “coward in chief.” She also referenced Trump’s handling, or mishandling, of the reports of Russians paying bounties for U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Duckworth has called Trump “Cadet Bone Spurs” in the past. “That’s the kind of leader our service members deserve, one who understands the risks they face and who would actually protect them by doing his job as commander in chief,” Duckworth says of Biden. Absolutely, Astead. They were largely concerned that Republicans would push the issue. And given the attacks we’ve seen on Harris, despite her being born in Oakland, Calif., they were right.  This will be one of the more emotional segments of the evening — a tribute to Biden’s son, Beau. It’s a lengthy tribute, and a reminder of how much conventions are shaped by the nominees. This video is not about Biden as a father but purely about his son. These segments on military service make sense politically. The 2018 Democratic blue wave was driven largely by “national security candidates” in swing districts. And now it’s time for “High Hopes!” (For those who don’t know, this was Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s walk up song on the campaign trail. He’s up next.) Buttigieg won the Iowa caucuses in which Biden was humiliated with a fourth-place finish. The former mayor’s campaign ended after he failed to win Black voters in South Carolina. He’s 38 and has a potential long political career ahead, including a possible cabinet job in a Biden administration. Biden’s record on gay rights is complex. He supported “don’t ask, don’t tell,” but later received credit for nudging Barack Obama toward a full endorsement of same-sex marriage.  Buttigieg is writing a book. But there’s a lot of speculation about what might be next for him after that. It will be hard for him to win statewide in Indiana. And next, a blast from the past: a segment featuring many of the 2020 candidates. This will likely make many political reporters feel a bit nostalgic… I’m feeling nostalgic! Funny Bernie! It opens with a Rosario Dawson joke. (That’s Cory Booker’s more famous girlfriend.) Buttigieg and Klobuchar dropping out of the race and endorsing Biden on the eve of Super Tuesday is a major reason Biden did as well as he did in states Sanders had once been expected to carry. “I wonder if even my mom is watching this on C-SPAN,” Klobuchar said, a classic all-the-way with Amy K joke. A think the former candidate sections are among the best. You see the way they largely get along, and it’s a payoff for Biden’s collegial nature. The fact that even Bernie is participating, and laughing (!), is really a testament to exactly that — and also how determined they all are to defeat Trump. I hate to say it, but this is very “After the Final Rose.” This feels like a smart segment. Many Democratic primary voters passionately preferred one of these hopefuls and only embraced Biden reluctantly. To Astead’s point, if ever there’s a “Dems in array” moment, it’s here on this video. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
