By Christine Hauser A large explosion at a West Virginia chemical plant killed one person and injured at least two others late Tuesday night, throwing debris more than a mile away and forcing a nearby highway and some schools to close, officials said. There were three chemical operators in the building at the time of the explosion, according to Optima Belle, the chemical company that owns the plant. Two operators were evaluated at a hospital and released, but the third operator died, the company said in a statement Wednesday. Separately, a county official had said that four people had been hospitalized. Officials told residents within a two-mile radius of the blast in the town of Belle, about 15 miles southeast of Charleston, to shelter in place. Classes at more than a dozen schools were canceled on Wednesday as a precaution. The authorities were investigating the cause of the explosion, which apparently involved dry chlorine and methanol, Kent Carper, the Kanawha County Commission president, said early on Wednesday. Firefighters worked to stabilize the blast, which settled into a controlled flare through the night, he said. “There was a lot of great concern,” he said. “This explosion was so loud that people were describing it — they thought it was an airplane crash or bomb.” The explosion occurred at about 10 p.m. in a manufacturing area owned by Optima Chemical, which operates in a complex in Belle owned by the Chemours Company, Optima Belle said in its statement. “Preliminary information indicates that a 1,200-gallon metal dryer became over pressurized during a chemical product drying operation,” it said. “The material in the dryer was a compound used for sanitization.” It added, “Optima is cooperating fully with local, state, and federal officials on continuing investigation of this incident.” Thom Sueta, a Chemours spokesman, said on Wednesday that emergency responders brought the fire under control by about midnight. “All Chemours employees were safe and accounted for last night,” he said in an email. “The safety of site employees, emergency responders and the community has been our first priority throughout the incident, so we waited until daylight to begin a thorough site damage assessment,” he added. One person was hit by flying debris and drove himself to the hospital, Mr. Carper said, and the three other people had injuries caused either by the fire or the explosion. The company has not released details about the injured people, including whether or how they were connected to the operations there. Optima Chemical has two manufacturing plants in the United States: the one in Belle, under an agreement with Chemours, and another in Douglas, Ga. The company says it manufactures “high energy and high hazard, sensitive chemistry” on a large scale. Mr. Sueta said Optima owns the buildings it occupies and the manufacturing equipment in its specific geographic area of the site, and that Chemours has its own manufacturing plant in a different part of the complex. Mr. Carper, the county commission president, said metal debris was blasted with such force that it was flung hundreds of feet across the river, which is wide enough for barges containing chemicals to pass in two-way traffic. According to preliminary information, he said, the site of the explosion was on a river bank. “Obviously some form of apparatus exploded, and blew metal,” he said. The shrapnel fragments were “very large in some cases. They hit cars, they blew clear across the river, hundreds of feet from the explosion, one city to another.” He said fire officials smelled chlorine when they arrived at the site, which stretches across more than 700 acres. Several companies are involved in the operations and management at the site, he said. “It took place within the fence,” he said. Concern about the explosion, Mr. Carper said, “shut down the entire education system in that part of the county. All together, 13 schools were closed.” About 20,000 people were affected by the shelter-in-place orders and Route 60, an interstate, was closed for several hours, he said. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
