By Melissa Eddy BERLIN — Aleksei A. Navalny, the prominent Russian dissident who fell ill while on a flight to Moscow last week, was in all likelihood poisoned, German doctors said on Monday, though they have yet to identify the specific agent. In a statement, doctors at the Charité hospital in Berlin, where Mr. Navalny was taken on Saturday, said they expected him to survive the attack, but that it was too early to gauge the long-term effects, including possible damage to the nervous system. He remained in a medically induced coma, in stable condition. While not able to pinpoint the exact poison, the doctors said tests showed it came from a group known as cholinesterase inhibitors, sometimes used to treat Alzheimer’s Disease. They said the antidote for that class of substances is atropine, which is also used against certain types of nerve gas. They did not say whether Mr. Navalny had been treated with atropine before his arrival in Germany. Mr. Navalny, who challenged President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in the 2018 election, and has waged a long battle to publicize rampant official corruption, has been attacked at least twice before, including one assault that left him mostly blind in one eye. He fell ill while returning from a trip to Russia’s Far East, where he was organizing opposition candidates and strategy for upcoming regional and local elections. His plane was then forced to make an emergency landing in the Siberian city of Omsk, where he was taken to a local hospital. His family and supporters organized an air ambulance to take him to Germany, but the Russian doctors delayed for nearly 48 hours, saying his medical condition was too unstable for him to be moved. That stance drew bitter criticism from the Navalny camp, which accused the doctors of employing stalling tactics to give the toxins enough time to drain from his system. Mr. Navalny was flown to Germany at the invitation of Chancellor Angela Merkel. Though Germany enjoys strong economic and cultural ties to Russia, it has not shied from criticizing policies of Mr. Putin, and even before Mr. Navalny arrived in Berlin, the German government appeared to be taking extra precautions to ensure his safety.
