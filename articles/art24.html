and Disease<br></h1><p id="artcont">Supported by This isn’t the first time missionaries have risked spreading disease alongside the word of god. By Manuela Lavinas Picq Ms. Lavinas Picq is a specialist in Indigenous politics and Latin America. As the coronavirus spread across the Amazon in March, the evangelical organization New Tribes Mission of Brazil was preparing for a mission to the Javari Valley — a remote region near the border with Peru that is home to one of the world’s largest concentration of Indigenous peoples. With a newly acquired helicopter, the group reportedly planned to contact and convert the Korubo tribe that lives in the valley in voluntary isolation. The operation risked spreading the coronavirus and other dangerous infections to people highly vulnerable to diseases transmitted by outsiders. The missionaries organized flights into the Javari Valley until late March. In April, a Brazilian judge banned them and other missionary groups from entering the area. (In response to criticism, the group denied that it planned to contact isolated tribes, and has said that it does not work with isolated peoples.) There is an evangelical conquista happening across Latin America and, in the struggle for religious hegemony, Amazonia is a sought-after prize. According to one survey, evangelicals now outnumber Catholics in the region. Evangelical missionaries are also entering politics, where they are trying to shape policy to make it easier to reach the last tribes.
