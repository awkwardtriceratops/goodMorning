By Adam Nagourney Donald J. Trump barely paused to thank his debate hosts before going on the attack after he took the stage at Hofstra University in September 2016. “Our jobs are fleeing the country,” he said grimly. “They’re going to Mexico.” For the next 90 minutes — and over the course of his two other debates with Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent — Mr. Trump displayed a relentless and disciplined debate style, at times bulldozing Mrs. Clinton and the debate moderators. Though many observers considered Mrs. Clinton the clear winner in the debates, Mr. Trump’s defiant attacks on Washington and his argument that the system was stacked against ordinary Americans resonated with angry and alienated voters and helped lead to his unexpected victory. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential candidate who will meet Mr. Trump on a debate stage for the first time on Tuesday night, was certainly not as aggressive when, as vice president, he debated his Republican opponent, Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, in October 2012. But Mr. Biden used a command of foreign policy, Congress and the White House to hammer and at times belittle his rival and turn back attacks on President Barack Obama. “With all due respect, that’s a bunch of malarkey,” he said, in the kind of conversational turn of phrase he has invoked throughout his career, when Mr. Ryan accused the administration of mishandling the deadly terrorist attack on American diplomats in Benghazi, Libya. For both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, the three presidential debates may well be the most critical moments of a fall campaign that is being carried out without the typical dawn-to-dusk days of rallies, local television appearances and talking to voters. Millions of Americans will set aside time in the midst of a pandemic to judge Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden side by side in the unfiltered forum of the two men on a stage. Through 14 primary and general election debates in 2015 and 2016, Mr. Trump  emerged as the showman, with a keen sense on how to seize the spotlight, hammer home clear and succinct themes and discombobulate an opponent with claims and accusations that, while often false, are difficult to rebut in real time.
