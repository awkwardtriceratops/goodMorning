She was found safely on Sunday, the authorities said. By Christine Hauser A 38-year-old woman who had been missing for nearly two weeks in Zion National Park in Utah was found safe on Sunday by search and rescue teams after a park visitor reported that they had seen her, the authorities said. The woman, Holly Suzanne Courtier, had disappeared on Oct. 6, after getting off a shuttle bus at the Grotto bus stop in the park. She was reunited with her family, which said in a statement Sunday that they were “overjoyed” that she was found safely. The search for Ms. Courtier drew officials from the Washington County Sheriff’s Office, park rangers, emergency service teams and search dogs. Volunteers also joined the effort, and search teams used drones and canine units, the National Park Service said in a series of statements about their efforts to locate her. “We would like to thank the rangers and search teams who relentlessly looked for her day and night and never gave up hope,” the family said in its statement. “We are also so grateful to the countless volunteers who were generous with their time, resources and support. This wouldn’t have been possible without the network of people who came together.” Ms. Courtier went missing after getting off the shuttle bus at the stop between 1 and 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 6, the park service said. She was reported missing two days later, the service said. Park officials and rescue teams did not immediately reply to calls and emails seeking information about the circumstances of finding Ms. Courtier or other details of her survival in the wild, such as how she found shelter and food. Nancy Hachmeister, a volunteer who joined a search and rescue team with her 6-year old German shepherd, Hanna, combed an area near the campgrounds of the park, using a cut-up T-shirt that Ms. Courtier had in her car as a scent item to guide the dog. Four other dog teams from her volunteer organization, Utah Search Dogs, a nonprofit organization in Brigham City, fanned out to help. But their efforts seemed to lead only to dead ends, as when Ms. Hachmeister and her dog climbed a hillside on Friday to examine a blue object. “It was a rock,” she said. “It was kind of grayish and it did look blue from a distance.” Ms. Courtier’s family could not be reached. A GoFundMe campaign that was set up after she went missing raised $10,000 for her rescue. It said that she had no phone with her and had told no one of her plans. It was updated on Sunday after Ms. Courtier was found, saying she needed medical care and had no insurance. On Saturday, her daughter, Kailey Chambers, told CNN that her mother was an experienced, fit hiker, capable of handling the rugged trails of the park. “This was her dream, to see national parks,” Ms. Chambers said. She said that her mother had just lost her job as a nanny. “She made that a positive thing — said that gave her the time to get out, see the parks,” Ms. Chambers said. Known for its canyons and waterfalls, Zion National Park is spread across more than 148,000 acres in Washington, Iron and Kane Counties in southwest Utah. More than four million people visit the park a year, according to the National Park Service, which said on its website that, in the past year, teams had searched for missing people in about two dozen national parks. People usually go missing because they become disoriented, lost, injured or their disappearance is voluntary or the result of a crime, the service said.   </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
