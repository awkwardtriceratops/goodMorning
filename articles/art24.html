Here’s What We Know<br></h1><p id="artcont">A man was shot and killed after supporters of President Trump clashed with counterprotesters. By Bryan Pietsch There have been nightly protests in Portland, Ore., since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. On Saturday night, a caravan of supporters of President Trump traveled through the city, clashing with counterprotesters. A man was shot and killed during the unrest. Here’s what we know so far. What happened in Portland? Supporters of Mr. Trump gathered on Saturday at a shopping center a few miles southwest of Portland. The caravan of hundreds of trucks then traveled into the city. Most were flying “Trump 2020” or thin blue line flags, which are commonly associated with support for the police and are often seen as antithetical to the Black Lives Matter movement. The caravan clashed with counterprotesters at times. People shot paintball guns from trucks, and protesters threw objects at them. A video showed a small group in the street, where gunfire erupts and a man collapses. Portland police officers heard reports of gunfire shortly before 9 p.m. local time and found a man with a gunshot wound to the chest, the police said. Medical responders arrived at the scene and determined that the man was dead, the police said. Who was the man who died? The man’s identity has not been released. He was wearing a hat with the insignia of Patriot Prayer, a far-right group based in Portland. The group says it seeks to combat “corruption, big government and tyranny, using God for strength and the power of love.” Do we know who the gunman was? The police have not released information about who fired the shots. Chief Chuck Lovell of the Portland police said on Sunday that “we are working diligently to find and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible.” What else has been happening in Portland? Protests have occurred nightly in the city since the killing of George Floyd in May. In recent weeks, right- and left-wing groups have clashed. On Aug. 22, a demonstration outside the U.S. courthouse in Portland turned violent as right-wing demonstrators, including Proud Boys members, clashed with Black Lives Matter protesters. Objects were thrown, paintballs were fired and shouting turned to shoving and punching. In July, camouflaged federal agents were sent to the city, against the wishes of the local authorities. What has President Trump said about the situation? Mr. Trump has not spoken specifically about the shooting death in Portland, but on Sunday morning, he retweeted a message that said Portland “needs to be federalized at this point.” Mr. Trump added to the message: “The National Guard is Ready, Willing and Able. All the Governor has to do is call!” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
