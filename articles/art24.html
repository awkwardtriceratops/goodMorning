By Allie Volpe The pandemic has left no one untouched, even the most secure among us. The stress of the combined health, economic and racial inequality crises has illuminated and intensified even our seemingly insignificant woes and worries. We’re collectively experiencing a monumental life shift and actively leaning on our inner circle for support as a result. This means that sometimes we’ll have to play armchair therapist with our friends. In fact, showing vulnerability promotes more intimate and enriching friendships. In this moment of widespread malaise, however, you may be called upon more frequently to be the emotional caretaker. While research has shown that friendship is a way to combat burnout, one-sided relationships can also contribute to emotional fatigue. “If you’re the one who’s on more of the receiving end, you can burn out,” said Racine Henry, a licensed marriage and family therapist in New York City. “It can become draining to be the one everyone calls and not the one people ask, ‘How are you doing?’ or ‘What do you need?’” Of course, we never want to leave our friends high and dry in a time of distress, but maintaining our own emotional equilibrium is crucial if we’re to be fully present for our companions, Dr. Henry said — which is important in this moment. Here’s how to remain supportive of your friends during a global crisis without feeling as if you’ve fallen into the role of therapist. The friend who typically fulfills the therapist role in a friendship usually has a knee-jerk reaction to problem solve when a loved one approaches them with a gripe or concern, said Jan Yager, a sociologist and the author of “Friendgevity: Making and Keeping the Friends Who Enhance and Even Extend Your Life.” Instead of immediately offering advice, we should ask our pals if they simply want to vent or if they’d like feedback, she said, because sometimes “they don’t want solutions, they want to share.” This is especially important during the pandemic when each person’s circumstances are different. A friend who lives alone and doesn’t regularly interact with others may want to get some things off their chest, while another might want your advice assessing the risk of a social activity. If your friend is looking for a compassionate ear instead of guidance, don’t mentally check out of the conversation. Dr. Yager said to offer validating remarks, like, “Thanks for letting me know that,” or, “I can’t believe that happened to you.” “You don’t have to immediately say, ‘Here are five things you can do to deal with what you’re going through,’” she said. In virtually all relationships, boundaries help prevent one person, job or activity from becoming all encompassing. Because our friends aren’t knowingly taking advantage of our time and insight, the onus is on the person who feels burned out to create a framework for when they’re available to provide a sympathetic ear, Dr. Henry said. While it’s normal to want to avoid coming off as insensitive or a bad person when telling a friend we’ll be unreachable during nights and weekends, it’s important to recognize that we need time to recharge, too, said Andrea Bonior, a licensed clinical psychologist in the Washington, D.C. area and the author of “Detox Your Thoughts: Quit Negative Self-Talk for Good and Discover the Life You’ve Always Wanted.” “It’s a matter of each day thinking about, ‘OK, here are the priorities that I have and here is what I have to give and here is what I don’t have to give,’” she said.
