By Marie Tae McDermott and Jill Cowan Good morning. Wildfires are spreading across California, Washington and Oregon at an astonishing rate, leaving thousands of scorched homes and businesses in their wake. Flying embers from wildfires can ignite and destroy homes up to one mile away. If you are not under immediate threat from a wildfire, there are steps you can take to make your home more resistant to fires. If you live within one of California’s Responsibility Areas, the state requires you to keep a “defensible space” around your property that is clear of brush or vegetation. “Having defensible space does make a big difference,” said Brian Centoni, the public information officer for the Fire Department in Alameda County, where the S.C.U. Lightning Complex Fire was 95 percent contained as of Thursday afternoon. However, you must leave your home if the authorities order you to evacuate. Mr. Centoni said that when evacuation orders for the S.C.U. Lightning Complex were issued in mid-August it meant to leave home as soon as possible in order to save lives.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends plugging a garden hose into a water line so fire departments can have access to it. You should identify and maintain water sources like hydrants, ponds and pools and make sure they are accessible. You can also ensure that your driveway is clear for emergency vehicles and that your address signs are clearly visible from the road. California has some of the strictest building codes in the nation, and new homes are required to be constructed with certain fire-resistant materials. Some have taken to building homes entirely out of flameproof materials. FEMA recommends regularly clearing your roof and gutters of dry leaves and other debris. To prevent embers from flying in, enclose or box in eaves, soffits, decks and other openings in the home’s structure; fine wire mesh can be used to cover vents, crawl spaces and the area underneath porches and decks. A defensible space around the perimeter of the house should be well-irrigated and free of brush, vegetation and other materials that could fuel a fire. Adding fuel breaks such as gravel walkways or driveways can also help.

The pandemic forced Oasis, a cabaret and nightclub whose drag shows were often packed, to close. Its owners had to furlough the whole staff. But then, my colleague Concepción de León reported, its owner had an idea: “If people couldn’t come to see drag, why not bring drag to the people?” Thus was born Meals on Heels. For about $100, a drag queen or king will deliver dinner, drinks and a curbside performance. The idea had its ups and downs — literally. “I was definitely performing on driveways that were at a 45-degree angle,” Amoura Teese, a drag performer whose given name is Ryan Maldonado, told Concepción. But ultimately, the performers figured out ways to work their new venues. The mini-shows got some local buzz, and now, the club’s owner said there’s more demand than they can keep up with.
