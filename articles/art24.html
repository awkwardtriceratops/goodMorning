Supported by By Alan Blinder At Texas A&M, the football stadium that normally holds about 110,000 people may allow fewer than 28,000 to start this season. Alabama and Auburn banned tailgating, and so did Mississippi’s governor. Marching bands are forbidden on the Atlantic Coast Conference’s fields, suites at Texas will not have self-service buffets and from Baylor to Boston College, hand sanitizer will be more common than printed tickets. Welcome to pandemic-era college football. No American sport has attempted such a widespread, open-to-anyone restart as the one college football is hurtling toward in about two dozen states. But with tens of thousands of coronavirus infections being reported nationwide each day and the first Football Bowl Subdivision matchups scheduled for next week, campus and government officials are racing to balance game day traditions with public health mandates. What unfolds in and around America’s stadiums could help determine whether college football teams still planning to play in 2020 can pull off seasons. The successes and failures could also have broad implications for how ordinarily large events, like concerts and presidential inauguration festivities, are staged in the months and years ahead. “I don’t think there’s any doubt that we are going to be under the microscope,” Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi, whose state will host a game next Thursday under government-imposed restrictions, said in an interview. College football officials have ordered on-field precautions — including larger team areas, smaller delegations to coin tosses and mask mandates for men and women on the sidelines — but many of the people affected by those changes are already living and working under strict health guidelines and are regularly tested for the virus. A year after Division I football attendance exceeded 42 million, hosting fans is an altogether different kind of gamble. Some universities, like Duke and West Virginia, have said they will not allow fans at first, and some experts are deeply skeptical of other schools’ plans for spectators. Even epidemiologists who were reluctant to offer definitive assessments of the wisdom of allowing fans at games said there were risks, in part because of how much scientists still have to learn about the virus and its behavior in large outdoor settings. “We all understand why people want to have the games, and we also understand why people would be concerned,” said Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at Minnesota. “And I think at this point, what we can’t give them is an absolute answer.” Not every stadium will be open, fans or not. The three largest venues in college football — Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, Beaver Stadium at Penn State and Ohio Stadium in Columbus — will all be silent this fall after the Big Ten postponed its season. The homes of Pac-12 teams, like the Rose Bowl, where U.C.L.A. plays its home games, and Autzen Stadium at Oregon, will be similarly empty. But of the 30 teams that recorded the highest cumulative home attendance last season, 21 are planning to play a fall season and some are still finalizing plans for spectators. Where football is still on the schedule, officials said they had tried to develop precautions from months of walk-throughs, virology tutorials, government negotiations and, to calculate social distancing in grandstands, refreshers on the Pythagorean theorem. “We’ve got a ton of plans, but we did not have one on the shelf for this,” said Josh Brooks, the senior deputy athletic director at Georgia and a leading architect of the strategy for this season’s games between Sanford Stadium’s famed hedges. “There was no straight-up pandemic plan. But there will be now.” Updated Aug. 26, 2020 Here’s what’s happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to life: Large reductions in stadium capacity are seen as particularly crucial, the condition upon which other adjustments for game days can be made. University officials said vastly smaller crowds — often 20 or 25 percent of normal seating — would make in-stadium social distancing a possibility while also easing strains at the times that officials now fear most: entry and exit, sustained stretches when people could clump together. “When you think about social or physical distancing, how do we implement that at our gate?” said Byron Hatch, an assistant commissioner of the Southeastern Conference. Schools are placing stickers on the ground to help people maintain social distancing, and some are opening their gates earlier to allow people more time to stream into the stadiums. Others have announced more elaborate measures, like Miami, which said its masked fans would be offered specific times to enter Hard Rock Stadium. Dozens of universities have embraced digital ticketing. Although universities said they made the shift to reduce the risk of transmission between people interacting with paper tickets, Osterholm noted that computerized tickets could aid in contact tracing in the event of an outbreak. Seats are frequently being sold in groups of two or four, and usually with at least one row separating blocs from each other. When fans leave their seats for restroom breaks or snacks, universities say they will insist that they wear masks. Concession stands, judged especially risky because of their typically long lines, shouted orders and hands everywhere, will also look different. Oklahoma will allow fans to order using a mobile app, while most universities, app or not, will insist on cashless payments. Many schools will offer only prepackaged foods from workers standing behind plexiglass barriers. And forget about self-service for drinks or condiments on most of those campuses. “By us being able to have some time before football season, we’ve been able to attack it piece by piece and talk through it,” said Hatch, who has been facilitating brainstorming sessions among officials from the SEC’s 14 universities, many of them positioned in some of the country’s most virus-ravaged states. During the calls, participants said, the tensions between on-field enemies that lend the sport so much of its shine and spunk faded away. “Everybody’s usually pretty good when you’re talking about logistical things, things that don’t provide a competitive advantage,” Brooks, the Georgia official, said. “Everyone’s very open in sharing because we want to find out if someone’s got a good idea. You never shy away from a good idea anywhere you can find it, even if it’s from a rival.” Although some conferences and universities have written their own procedures, government officials ordered some limits. Last week, for instance, Reeves barred tailgating and set capacity limits for stadiums in his state, which includes three F.B.S. schools: Mississippi, Mississippi State and Southern Mississippi. Reeves said that he issued his executive order after consultations with university presidents and athletic directors, but that in his judgment, “it’s the governor who has to sign the piece of paper,” not campus leaders. The decision to outlaw tailgating, he said, provoked the deepest skepticism, hardly surprising in a state where pregame parties are as much a pastime as the competitions themselves. “One of our Achilles’ heels with respect to tailgating, and why I felt we needed to not allow it this year, was that we’re just too dadgum good at it,” Reeves said. With tent after tent erected outside stadiums, and oftentimes at least a dozen people crowded into each spot, he said, “it’s like one big bar scene” that would hardly be conducive to countering the virus. And even though they usually miss most of the festivities outside the gates, players and coaches have spent the off-season considering what environments might await them inside, if they get to play at all. Jack Wohlabaugh, a center at Duke, said he and some teammates had walked through an empty Wallace Wade Stadium last week on their way to practice and realized that game day might not be all that much louder. Days later, Duke said it would bar fans at the season’s start. “We’ve kind of just got to adjust for what’s happening right now,” said Wohlabaugh, a redshirt senior who spent two seasons at Ohio State. “The general consensus obviously is, yeah, we want everything to be normal and how it is year in and year out. But due to the circumstances, we’re open to it all.” He regrets the energy that will be lost, the spirit that so often defines college football and sometimes prompts teams to practice with pumped-in crowd noise. But if Wohlabaugh crouches in Durham or on the road, smaller or nonexistent crowds will almost certainly offer one benefit. The snap counts will be a lot easier to hear. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
