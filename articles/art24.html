Jails Become More Violent, Solitary Confinement Persists<br></h1><p id="artcont">Even as Mayor Bill de Blasio has emptied out the city’s jails, the number of people who are placed in punitive segregation each year has remained about the same. By Jan Ransom The number of people held in New York City jails has dropped steadily under Mayor Bill de Blasio, and it continued to fall this year as the city emptied out its jails to curb the spread of the coronavirus. But there is one number at Rikers Island and the city’s other jails that has held constant in the last three years, despite the mayor’s strenuous efforts to reduce it: the tally of people in solitary confinement. Even as the jail population dropped, correction officials have relied on solitary confinement to punish about the same number of inmates each year since 2017, records show. And that trend continued in the first six months of this year as the jails released hundreds of people because of the pandemic. In the first six months of 2020, about 13 percent of 7,200 people detained on Rikers Island spent time in solitary confinement, a much higher percentage so far this year than during the previous three years. Solitary confinement, also referred to as punitive segregation, is the practice of holding an inmate in a cell for most of the day as punishment and to separate the person from others. Its persistence, officials say, reflects a broader challenge at the Rikers Island complex and in the city’s other jails: As the population has shrunk, the inmates who remain tend to be more violent. Fights between inmates and the use of force by correction officers are both rising, and unions that represent the guards said solitary confinement remained an important tool for punishing disorderly inmates. The city now has an average daily population of 4,700 inmates, down from 10,900 in 2014, when Mr. de Blasio took office. When the outbreak began, the city moved to release 1,500 people from its jails. During his first three years in office, Mr. de Blasio’s administration made great strides in reducing the number of people held in solitary confinement. Between 2013 and 2017, the number of inmates held in the most restrictive isolation units fell by more than two-thirds. But from 2017 through 2019, the number held in punitive segregation each year remained largely unchanged, at about 1,700, even as the population dropped from 46,100 to about 31,500, according to city statistics. In fact, the percentage of the population facing this punishment actually increased. One reason, officials say, is that many of the inmates held in jail now are awaiting trial on charges they committed violent offenses and have mental health issues. “We are dealing with a more difficult population,” said the city’s correction commissioner, Cynthia Brann. “The use of punitive segregation is incident-driven,” she said. “People are not put there arbitrarily.” Mr. de Blasio nevertheless pledged in June to make New York City one of the first major jurisdictions to do away with solitary confinement altogether, setting up a panel to develop a plan for the city. His decision was motivated in part by the death last year of Layleen Polanco, a transgender woman who had an epileptic seizure while in solitary after guards failed to check on her. Her family was granted a $5.9 million settlement in August, the largest ever for an inmate’s death at Rikers Island. “We need to make changes immediately in how people who are incarcerated in our jail system are handled and we need to make sure they are safe,” Mr. de Blasio said in June. City officials first moved to restrict the use of solitary confinement for young people after the suicide of Kalief Browder, a teenager who spent three years on Rikers Island awaiting trial on a robbery charge, much of it in isolation, only to have the charges dropped. His death prompted the city to ban solitary confinement first for 16- and 17-year-olds, and later for detainees under 22. The city also has ended the practice for pregnant women and detainees with serious mental illness, among other vulnerable categories of people, and other big-city jails across the country have followed suit. In addition, the city has limited the time an inmate could be held in punitive segregation to 30 consecutive days, except in cases of serious assaults. Still, solitary confinement has remained a stubborn constant of jail life, and correction officers say that is because the city’s jail system has become increasingly violent. There were more than 500 inmate fights per month in 2019 — a 37 percent increase over the previous three years, according to a recent report by a federal monitor overseeing reforms on Rikers. With violence still high, union leaders representing correction officers have argued that punitive segregation is necessary to protect officers and inmates from violent detainees. “If we are unable to physically separate the inmates responsible for jail violence, how can anyone expect jail violence to decrease?” asked Benny Boscio Jr., the new president of the Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association, which has 9,200 members. Joseph Russo, president of the union representing assistant deputy wardens and deputy wardens, said the inmates are “assaulting us with little or no fear of consequence.” Still, some experts say there is no proof that solitary confinement curbs violence behind bars. “That brutality only yields more brutality,” said Stanley Richards, vice-chair of the Board of Correction and executive vice president of the Fortune Society. “It doesn’t address the underlying issues.” Research has also shown that the practice is particularly damaging to the still-developing brains of adolescents and young adults. Prolonged isolation in solitary cells can cause or worsen mental illness, according to research. “I started to see dead people — talking to me telling me it was OK to join them,” said Anisah Sabur, a member of the Coalition for Women Prisoners who spent 120 days in solitary confinement on Rikers in 1988. “Solitary is not a place where you help someone rehabilitate.” ” Last year, lawmakers in several states, including New Jersey, Nebraska and New Mexico, either restricted or banned punitive segregation for certain prisoners, including minors, pregnant people and individuals with severe mental illness. In Colorado, state prisoners can only be held in isolation for up to 15 days at a time, and in Chicago, a less restrictive and more rehabilitative housing unit replaced solitary confinement. In Germany, jail officials rarely use solitary to discipline inmates. Ms. Brann said ending solitary in New York City will require officials to identify the jail population’s needs and to identify resources to support them. The Department of Correction, she said, has had some success in placing people with complicated mental health histories in units where they receive intensive, therapeutic services. One report released last year by the New York City Jails Action Coalition suggested that disruptive inmates be held in cells for hours instead of days and months in an effort to defuse conflicts. The report also suggested that inmates who are held in isolation receive at least 14 hours of out-of-cell time. Alternatives to punitive segregation should be rooted in rehabilitation, the report’s authors added, pointing to an initiative in San Francisco jails known as Resolve to Stop the Violence Program, which targets the system’s most violent inmates with educational programs and psychological counseling. The death of Ms. Polanco, 27, who had a history of seizures and schizophrenia, drew attention to the practice of punitive segregation. Despite having had two seizures within weeks of arriving at the jail and a warning from a psychiatrist, Ms. Polanco was sentenced to 20 days in solitary confinement as punishment for altercations with two inmates and assaulting a correction officer. She died of an epileptic seizure nine days later. Mr. de Blasio said that she never should have been in solitary given her mental and medical history. Seventeen correction officers were disciplined. In June, Mr. de Blasio banned solitary for inmates who are deaf or blind or who have asthma, seizure disorders, diabetes, lung disease, liver disease, kidney or heart disease. According to the city, nearly half of the inmates in solitary in June had at least one of these disqualifying health conditions. Some experts say getting rid of solitary altogether will not be easy. Martin Horn, the city’s former correction commissioner, said that if the city removes the threat of solitary confinement, jail officers will need another form of leverage to maintain order. He said correction officers need to be able to discipline an inmate who, for instance, refuses to obey an order to “move along” or “sit on your bed.” “You can’t just tolerate that behavior or the jail can’t operate,” Mr. Horn said. “What do you do if an inmate writes down a threat? What do you do with an inmate who routinely exposes himself to female staff?” Mr. Horn added, “It’s a very touchy, difficult issue. Unless you work in a jail, you don’t understand. There are no easy answers.” Elaine Chen contributed data analysis. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
