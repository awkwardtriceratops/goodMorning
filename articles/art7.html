By Christopher Clarey Serena Williams started this most unusual United States Open in usual fashion by winning her first-round match in Arthur Ashe Stadium against lower-ranked opposition. But Williams continued to project vulnerability on Tuesday, just as she has since the resumption of play on the women’s tour after a six-month break forced by the coronavirus pandemic. Williams, seeded No. 3, lost her opening service game in both sets and frequently struggled to find her range on her groundstrokes before stabilizing to win 7-5, 6-3 against Kristie Ahn, an unseeded American ranked 96th in the world. “I was really happy with how I just fought for every point,” Williams said. “No matter how I was playing, I was like, ‘OK, Serena, just got to get my Serena focus back.’ So that’s what I’ve been trying to work on today.” Ahn, a former collegiate star at Stanford University, reached the fourth round at last year’s U.S. Open but has yet to win a singles match on the tour in 2020. She had never faced Williams, the 38-year-old who has been the most successful women’s player of the 21st century and is chasing a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title at this tournament. But Ahn, like so many of Williams’s recent opponents, did not appear intimidated by Williams’s power or her résumé, cleverly mixing tactics and often getting the better of the baseline exchanges until midway through the second set.
