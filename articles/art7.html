By Gail Collins and Bret Stephens Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every week. Bret Stephens: Gail, you sometimes write columns asking readers to vote for the worst members of the Trump administration. With that in mind, what are your candidates for the worst moments in the Trump presidency? His behavior since Joe Biden became president-elect has got to be in the Top 5. What else? Gail Collins: Bret, we have to start from the very first day, when Trump obsessed about proving his inauguration crowd was bigger than Barack Obama’s. Which, of course, it wasn’t. But it did set a trend: the administration was going to focus on stupid things and propose phony new versions of history. Or medicine. Or any kind of reality. Bret: Alternative facts, Gail. Also known as lying. Gail: Your next nominee? Bret: The child-separation policy was definitely the administration’s single most disgraceful policy. Cruel, reckless and stupid — like Trump himself. I’d place that in the same basket of deplorable acts alongside the Muslim immigration ban, his accusation that Democrats want illegal immigrants “to pour into and infest our country,” and his drastic reduction of the number of refugees admitted into the country. We’re still only scratching the surface, Gail. What’s next on your list? Gail: Gonna go with coronavirus. No idea how well a normal administration would have done in containing it, but history will remember Trump as the president who pooh-poohed a pandemic. Bret: … while suggesting that Americans inject themselves with disinfectants as a way of beating the virus. Gail: Yeah, we’ll always have BleachGate. Bret: We also can’t ignore the foreign policy hit parade. Exchanging “beautiful” letters with Kim Jong-un. Taking Vladimir Putin at his word on the question of Russia’s election interference. Strong-arming the president of Ukraine to provide political dirt on the Biden family. Asking Xi Jinping’s help to get re-elected. Calling NATO into question. Maybe one of our clever readers can set all this to the tune of Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire.” What bothers me most of all, Gail, is Trump’s serial trashing of political norms, which wasn’t so much a moment as it was a constant. He’ll be remembered as the president who treated every civil servant as a personal servant, every cabinet secretary as a toady, every critic as an enemy, every enemy as a role model and every supporter as a fool. That’s why we’re nearly as freaked out about him now as we were before the election. Gail: And hey, I wanted to thank you for all your reassurance about his departure. We’ve been hearing a lot of yelps from the Trump camp, but no effective legal challenges. You told me he was too much of a coward to fight, and you were right. Bret: Again, fingers crossed. Firing his secretary of defense was, um, disturbing, even if it was done out of pure spite. Gail: Yeah, nothing’s going to protect us from a couple of months of complete craziness. Bret: I see two options. One is that Trump just decamps to Mar-a-Lago and basically quits being president so that he can raise money for his political action committee and start a media company to compete with Fox News. The other is some combination of weird and scary. Seeing anything in particular in your crystal ball? Gail: I wouldn’t dismiss the Mar-a-Lago scenario. Rather than come to grips with losing he could just retreat to his safe place and avoid reality altogether. Bret: Good. He can become that guy writing irate letters to the columnists he loves to hate. Gail: Pretending nothing’s happened might be better than going through nine weeks of tantrums and tirades. But I’m really freaked out by his refusal to let Biden have any briefings — or even a desk in the basement. Bret: I know you weren’t George W. Bush’s biggest fan, but Barack Obama and his team gave the outgoing Bush administration high marks when it came to ensuring a smooth transition. It’s just another way in which Trump makes all of his predecessors, with the arguable exception of James Buchanan, look good. Gail: Ah Bret, I think it’s time to take another look at James Buchanan.
