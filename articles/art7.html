By Stefanos Chen While Manhattanâ€™s real estate market continued to reel in August, Brooklyn had a near-record number of contract signings, spurred by bargain hunting New Yorkers and pent-up demand from months under quarantine. There were 735 homes in Brooklyn that went into contract in August, a 38.7 percent increase from the same month last year, according to a new report from the real estate listings company StreetEasy. Contract signings were down 6 percent in Manhattan, and 4.3 percent in Queens in the same period. Pending sales data were not available for the Bronx and Staten Island. The large jump in Brooklyn contract signings marks the first time that a borough has recorded year-over-year sales growth since February, before Covid-19 froze the market. The only time more contracts were signed in the borough was March 2019, when 748 deals were entered, said Nancy Wu, an economist for StreetEasy.
