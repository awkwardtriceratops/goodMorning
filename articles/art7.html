By Kim Bosch Most parents never expected they’d be in grade school again, and yet, here we are: the alphabet, the multiplication tables, the order of colors in a rainbow … Despite the best efforts of compassionate teachers who are attempting to form connections with their students over Zoom, parents are still playing a big role in online education this fall. They hover over the computer, print the cutout activity (and provide the scissors), and find the bean seed and the paper towels and the plastic cup and water and watch something grow (hopefully). “Don’t forget to document your findings!” Parents will help them do that, too. In a moment when time is precious and energy even more so, it might be challenging for parents to understand how growing a bean in a cup fits into their child’s larger education picture. This lack of understanding, this lack of control, leaves parents feeling even more anxious, and you may be asking yourself: How will I even know if my child is learning anything this year? The short answer: Focus on the outcomes. “Learning Outcomes” (which are sometimes called “goals” or even “standards”) are a set of skills a student should master by the end of a school year. For example, a typical outcome for a third-grade student in language arts might be, “Student can use transition words to vary sentence structure,” or in mathematics, “Student can estimate and measure perimeter,” or in arts and dance, “Student can demonstrate simple dance sequences.” Outcomes are a clear and measurable list of skills.
