By Aimee Ortiz and Marie Fazio After days of speculation and anticipation, a giant panda at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington gave birth to a cub on Friday evening, the zoo announced. Mother and cub were doing well. The panda, Mei Xiang, gave birth around 6:35 p.m. and was “nursing her cub and cuddling it close,” the zoo said in a tweet. 🐼 A precious giant panda cub has arrived! We’re overjoyed to share that Mei Xiang gave birth at 6:35 p.m. and is caring for her newborn attentively. Positive mothering behaviors include nursing her cub and cuddling it close. 👀🎥 TUNE IN: https://t.co/99lBTV2w92. #PandaStory pic.twitter.com/x02fEYfAmx After more than three hours of labor, Mei Xiang, who was lying on her side, honked a few times as she gave birth, rose and picked up her cub, said Brandie Smith, deputy director of the zoo. Soon after, the cub began squeaking. The cub was a “tiny little pink bald thing,” she said, adding that a panda cub’s size is often compared to a stick of butter. For the first week of the cub’s life, Mei Xiang will stay in her den without eating or drinking while she cares for her newborn, Ms. Smith said. When the zookeepers see her leave her den for the first time, they will enter to do a quick exam on the cub. “We know from her history that she’s a good mom, and she’s going to take care of that cub,” she added. Zookeepers will monitor the pandas over video. About half of all giant panda births are twins, so staff members are on “twin watch.” If another cub is born,  it would happen within 24 hours of the first birth.
