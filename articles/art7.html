We need to see beyond the bluster, and look at the way Trump has treated our community in the U.S. By Mariana Atencio Ms. Atencio is a journalist. MIAMI — This year I’ll be voting for the first time in a U.S. presidential election. Registering to vote online, the option to mail-in my ballot or vote early — it’s all new to me. The last time I voted, in 2013 in Caracas, Venezuela, I lined up for hours under the blazing hot sun, surrounded by heavily armed soldiers, to cast my vote against Nicolás Maduro. After depositing my ballot in a box, I dipped my pinkie finger in purple ink, visible proof that I’d voted. Yet I couldn’t help feeling dejected. An ink stain means nothing when your vote won’t count because the ruling party is determined to stay in power no matter what. In the years since, over four million Venezuelans have fled their country amid the economic and humanitarian crisis wrought by Mr. Maduro’s policies. I’m part of this new wave of Latin American immigrants who now call Miami home. In the past four years, I’ve become increasingly alarmed by the growing echoes here of the authoritarianism I endured back home — polarization, attacks on the press, the scapegoating of immigrants, casting doubt over the electoral system. I’ve watched this movie before. This spring I became a citizen, putting me among the just over three percent of the Florida electorate that is Venezuelan-American, according to Equis Research. In this battleground state, where roughly 26 percent of the population is Latino, the vote of people of Puerto Rican, Cuban, Colombian, Venezuelan, Nicaraguan origin could be decisive. In 2016, Donald Trump narrowly carried Florida with a little over 48 percent to Hillary Clinton’s 47 percent. While she won the overall Latino vote, roughly half of Cuban voters backed Mr. Trump. Venezuelan-Americans are deeply divided and worried about the results of this election — not just because of what it could mean for us here, but also how it will affect our home country. While the Obama-Biden administration was largely inattentive to the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, Mr. Trump has the support of many Venezuelan-Americans in part because of the economic embargo his administration imposed. He sealed the deal when he formally recognized the opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the interim president of Venezuela, and invited him to the State of the Union address.
