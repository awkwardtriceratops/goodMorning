From the role of president, to the threat of another civil war to the soul of the country itself, we’re all harboring some kind of fantasy that we should probably interrogate. Discussed this week: Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’s acceptance speech “FDT” (YG & Nipsey Hussle, 2016) “How to Cool It” (James Baldwin, Esquire, 1968) “Boarded-Up Windows and Increased Security: Retailers Brace for the Election” (New York Times, November 2020) “The Purge” (directed by James DeMonaco, 2013) “The First Purge” (directed by Gerard McMurray, 2018) “Still Processing” is produced by Hans Buetow and edited by Sara Sarasohn and Sasha Weiss, with editorial oversight from Wendy Dorr and Lisa Tobin. Our engineer is Marion Lozano. Our theme music is by Kindness. It’s called “World Restart,” from the album “Otherness.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
