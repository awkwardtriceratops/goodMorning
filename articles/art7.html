Is a Record Finish in Store?<br></h1><p id="artcont">Williams prevailed against Tsvetana Pironkova on Wednesday, advancing to a semifinal against Victoria Azarenka, a rival and a friend. A championship would tie Williams with Margaret Court at 24 major singles titles. By Christopher Clarey Down a set and a break to the unseeded Tsvetana Pironkova in the quarterfinals of the United States Open, Serena Williams was in danger of succumbing to a story line even better than her own. Pironkova is not only unseeded. She is unranked and was playing in her first tour event in more than three years. Not even Williams, a 38-year-old master of the comeback, has taken it to that extreme. Pironkova, 32, is a tall Bulgarian veteran with an iconoclastic game who changes rhythm more often than “Bohemian Rhapsody.” She gave birth to a son, Alexander, in April 2018 and was uncertain whether she wanted to return to the tour at all. She clearly made a sound career move, and on Wednesday was in range, if not quite on the brink, of her biggest victory before Williams came back to prevail, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.
