Yes, and Doctors Say You Should<br></h1><p id="artcont">You could help prevent a “twindemic” of influenza and Covid-19, they say. Doctors have specific advice for people over 65, pregnant women and those with egg allergies. Here’s what you need to know. By Concepción de León People usually don’t think about flu shots until the fall, so you might be surprised to learn that many places are already offering them. Public health officials, fearing that the confluence of Covid-19 and influenza cases could result in a “twindemic” that will further overburden hospitals and testing locations, are urging vaccination for nearly everyone. “We don’t have many arrows in our quiver in terms of combating Covid,” said Dr. Kevin Ban, the chief medical officer for Walgreens, which began administering the vaccine across its stores on Aug. 17. That’s why medical professionals are focusing instead on minimizing flu cases, so “resources go where they need to,” he added. Here is everything doctors want you to know about the influenza vaccine this year. “Everyone above the age of 6 months should be getting the flu vaccine,” said Dr. Uchenna Ikediobi, an assistant professor of general internal medicine and infectious diseases at Yale University. In particular, those who are at a higher risk should get it, she said. This includes adults over 65 years old, those with underlying illnesses like asthma or heart disease, pregnant women, caretakers who are exposed to vulnerable groups, and essential workers, among others. For specific guidance about when these groups should get the vaccine, see below. Growing concern over the combined impact of the two viruses has even led some to mandate the vaccine. The University of California system announced this month that it would require all its employees and students to get a flu shot by Nov. 1. And Massachusetts is requiring all students between 6 months and 30 years old to get the flu shot by the end of the year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone get the flu shot in September or October, before the start of the flu season. Experts suggest that adults over 65 and those with compromised immune systems wait until at least mid-September, so that the vaccine’s protection lasts the entire season. But if you are young and healthy, “if the flu shot is available in your area, I would suggest to get it” now, said Dr. Jasmine Marcelin, an infectious disease physician at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Dr. William Schaffner, the medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said it was better to go early than not at all. And if you miss the recommended time frame, you should still go, since influenza cases typically reach their peak in February. Not every vaccine is a perfect match, and sometimes people still get sick even if they get a shot. But it will make your illness less severe, and make it less likely you’ll end up in the hospital, Dr. Schaffner said. Absolutely. Despite unfounded fears, there is no evidence of adverse effects in most people. Some people do experience mild symptoms like a sore arm, itchy eyes or fatigue after getting the flu shot, but these usually go away on their own within a few days. Even if you are pregnant, you can and should get vaccinated. Pregnant women are one of the groups the C.D.C. says are at high risk for influenza complications. Vaccines undergo several clinical trials, the results of which are reviewed and approved by the Food and Drug Administration before the medicine is released to the public. The vaccines continue to be monitored for safety and effectiveness, and every year the C.D.C. releases new flu vaccination guidelines. Some vaccines are grown using chicken eggs, so some people with egg allergies have avoided getting the shot. Those with mild or moderate egg allergies should still get the shot, Dr. Marcelin said. If you have a severe allergy, however, you should consult your doctor, who should supervise the vaccination. There is also an egg-free vaccine available. If you are pregnant and allergic to eggs you should consult your doctor about the best vaccine for you. There’s a nasal version of the flu vaccine. While past studies have found that method to be most effective for children, that guidance has changed in recent years. The nasal vaccine is now approved for people ages 2 to 49, unless they are pregnant or have certain medical conditions. And you should not get this type of treatment with a runny or congested nose, Dr. Marcelin said, because that can interfere with the delivery of the vaccine. The nasal spray is not as widely available — Walgreens, for instance, does not carry it — but you can request it from your doctor.
