Novak Djokovic Is in His Way.<br></h1><p id="artcont">If Nadal defeats Djokovic on Sunday for his 13th championship at Roland Garros, he will match Roger Federer’s 20 singles titles in Grand Slam tournaments. By Christopher Clarey It should come as no surprise that Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic will meet in another French Open final. Djokovic is No. 1 and has not lost a completed match in this disjointed 2020 tennis season. Nadal is No. 2 and the greatest clay-court player in the game’s long history. Nadal will be aiming for his 13th French Open title, Djokovic for his second. Both advanced on Friday with victories over seeded opponents who had reason to hope for better. Nadal won, 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (0), against Diego Schwartzman, who upset him on clay in the Italian Open last month. Djokovic won, 6-3, 6-2, 5-7, 4-6, 6-1, against Stefanos Tsitsipas, who had beaten him twice in five previous matches and who pushed him to the limit this time. But Sunday’s showdown — the 56th match in the rich rivalry between Nadal and Djokovic, and their third meeting in the French Open final — will be about more than winning this unique October edition of Roland Garros. It will be about the historical pecking order. If Nadal prevails, he will equal Roger Federer’s men’s record of 20 Grand Slam singles titles. If Djokovic prevails, he will narrow the gap with his longtime rivals. The title would be his 18th and would make him the first of the so-called Big Three to win each of the four majors twice. Numbers, so many numbers. It is part of their legacy, and at times, their burden. Djokovic has the overall edge against Nadal, with a 29-26 advantage, but Nadal leads by 17-7 on clay and by 6-1 at Roland Garros. Djokovic is one of only two men to have defeated Nadal in this tournament. Robin Soderling beat Nadal in the fourth round in 2009, and Djokovic beat him in the quarterfinals in 2015, a rare downbeat year in Nadal’s career. Nadal is bracing himself for Sunday’s final against Djokovic. “He is one of the toughest opponents possible, but I am here to keep trying my best,” he said. “I know I have to make a step forward. I think I did one today, but for Sunday, it’s not enough. I need to make another one.” Djokovic has certainly had the harder road to the final. While Nadal has not dropped a set in six matches, Djokovic has dropped three in his last two — going four sets with Pablo Carreño Busta in the quarterfinals and five with Tsitsipas, the swashbuckling 22-year-old Greek.
