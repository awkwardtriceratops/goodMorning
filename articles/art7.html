By Neil Genzlinger A headline on the cover of The National Enquirer in June 1982 became the defining element of Cathy Smith’s life. “‘I Killed John Belushi,’” it read, alongside a large photograph of Mr. Belushi, the boisterous comedian. Below the picture another headline added, “World Exclusive — Mystery Woman Confesses.” The headline and accompanying article were the catalyst that ultimately landed Ms. Smith in jail. Before the Enquirer article, the circumstances surrounding Mr. Belushi’s death the previous March, at 33, had remained murky, and it was simply labeled an accidental drug overdose. Mr. Belushi, who became a television star on “Saturday Night Live” and a movie star in “National Lampoon’s Animal House” — and whose heavy drug use was later documented in Bob Woodward’s book “Wired” — went on a days-long drug binge in a bungalow of the Chateau Marmont Hotel in West Hollywood with Ms. Smith, who had been a fringe figure on the music scene first in Toronto and then Los Angeles.
