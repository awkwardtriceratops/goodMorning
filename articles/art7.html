Here’s how it works. By Patricia Cohen and Tiffany Hsu Two weeks have passed since President Trump declared a plan to deliver $400 in extra weekly benefits to tens of millions of unemployed Americans — a short-term fix meant to replace the $600-a-week emergency federal supplement that expired last month. What is now clear is that the federal supplement is $300 a week, not $400. And by Thursday, only one state, Arizona, had started paying out. Here is what we know. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which normally provides disaster relief, will provide $300 per recipient. An additional $100 was supposed to be supplied by states, but most are struggling to meet other expenses. Tax revenues have been sinking at the same time that costs — like precautions to curb the spread of the coronavirus — have soared. Ultimately the administration said the states’ basic benefit payments could be counted toward their $100 share. Montana is the only state so far to choose the $400 option, according to FEMA. Only people who qualify for at least $100 per week in unemployment benefits — either through the regular state program or a federal pandemic assistance program — are eligible for the extra federal funds. In Colorado, for example, roughly 28,000 people, or about 6 percent currently receiving unemployment pay, will not receive the new benefit, said Cher Haavind, deputy executive director of the state Department of Labor. As of Monday, funds had been approved for 30 states: Alabama
Alaska
Arizona
California
Colorado
Connecticut
Georgia
Idaho
Indiana
Iowa
Kentucky
Louisiana
Maryland
Massachusetts
Michigan
Mississippi
Missouri
Montana
New Hampshire
New Mexico
New York
North Carolina
Oklahoma
Pennsylvania
Rhode Island
Tennessee
Texas
Utah
Vermont
Washington One state has declined to take part. South Dakota’s governor, Kristi Noem, announced that her state would forgo the federal funds, saying they were not needed because South Dakota had recovered 80 percent of its job losses. Many states are still reviewing the rules issued by the federal government to determine how to carry them out. Florida is mulling “the best course of action that will preserve the state’s financial stability while providing important assistance to Floridians in need,” said Cody McCloud, the press secretary to Gov. Ron DeSantis. Ohio plans to apply, but is considering what it needs to do to upgrade its systems, said Bret Crow, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. States have until Sept. 10 to apply for the funds. Each state is supposed to administer the new supplement, just as it processes regular state unemployment insurance and federal pandemic jobless benefits. In the spring, when state unemployment systems were overwhelmed with claims, there were delays of weeks or even months because computer systems had to be updated and reprogrammed, and staff members trained. Now states must again work out how to process a new program while they keep existing benefits flowing. New claims for state jobless benefits unexpectedly jumped in the most recent weekly report to 1.1 million. On a conference call with reporters on Thursday, John P. Pallasch, assistant secretary for employment and training at the Labor Department, said it could take some states up to six weeks to figure out how to get a program up and running. On Aug. 17, Arizona became the first state to start paying out. On Aug. 20, it was still the only one to have done so.
