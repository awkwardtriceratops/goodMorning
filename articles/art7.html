Fear persists about what lies ahead. But small transformations have unfolded that reveal the grit and gifts of the city’s people. By Corina Knoll Even as the coronavirus is ravaging the country and the world, a new reality is emerging in New York City. Nowhere is that more evident than on a stretch of 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens, that is now a lively symbol of renewal in a neighborhood where the virus infected one in 22 people and claimed 260 lives. Residents began trickling to the partially closed-off street soon after the deadliest days had passed. Strollers and wheelchairs appeared. A retired nurse planted purple corn and sunflowers in the median, and a group took up a daily bingo game. Regular Zumba classes cropped up, then English-language lessons. Families bicycled in packs, and neighbors cheered one day when a boy finally got to remove his training wheels. Artists sketched murals in chalk next to picnics while children zipped through makeshift obstacle courses. The renewal in New York City comes roughly six months after it became the epicenter of the virus in the United States. Six months of hardship and numbness: Nearly 24,000 people in the city have died during a pandemic that beat down into it, preyed on its vulnerabilities and sent its identity reeling. The virus soon spread everywhere. On Tuesday, the nation’s coronavirus death toll surpassed 200,000. Still, in the city, where the infection rate has on some days dropped to only 1 percent, there have been small transformations that have revealed the grit and gifts of those who stayed as others scurried to second homes. During a crisis that has not disappeared, there are signs of resilience and innovation — vibrancy in unusual places and a reimagining of community, resources and opportunity. And a distinct sense of resolve: Our landscape was profoundly altered. But we remain. We will endure. It is not a tale of triumph. There is no presumption that any sorrow or despair will be erased. Industries, pastimes, institutions, systems, livelihoods and families have been broken. The trauma of the last six months will play out for lifetimes. And fear about what lies ahead persists. (On Tuesday night, city health officials warned about a troubling uptick in virus cases in Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods.) Yet this is a moment of adaptation and improvisation. When people pool what they have to create something new. When they take unfamiliar steps away from what was to what can work now. In Central Park, weddings and birthday parties, once tucked away in rented halls, have spilled out into the open — the celebrations jubilant though everyone is wearing masks. A struggling Greek restaurateur in Queens has added ambience to curbside tables with lanterns and bouquets. Top designers like Christian Siriano and Naeem Khan have included mask-making in their repertoire. In Brooklyn, a trio of D.J.s throw digital parties to raise money for the owners of dance lounges, while a coffee shop in Bedford-Stuyvesant stocks four community refrigerators with fresh fruits and vegetables for the needy. An opera singer performs every night while standing on a ledge of the Mansion House in Brooklyn Heights. “There are still these beautiful moments that you don’t have in any other place in the world, like walking in Prospect Park and stumbling upon a jazz concert or a brass band,” said Dominique Nisperos, 37, a comedian and sociologist from Bedford-Stuyvesant who spent two months recovering from Covid-19. “The lows of the pandemic have been really low, but what’s been my saving grace has been the people of New York.” Even the subtlest shows of coping can be lifelines in a city pummeled and suffering: Roughly half of New York State’s 2.8 million people collecting unemployment benefits are in the city, where long lines overwhelm food pantries and homeless shelters are strained. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city’s subways, buses and two commuter rails, is facing the largest financial crisis in its history, one that could cripple the system (although it has never been more clean and roomy). The 1.1 million students who attend New York City’s public schools have found their year upended, with poor families thrown into impossible situations. The divide between landlords and housing and retail tenants has become even more vast. Tourism has been wiped out, and Broadway has been shut down until next year. Nightlife establishments have been annihilated, restaurants shattered. Also, winter is coming. What will we do in winter? If faith exists in anything, it is in the clever and enterprising ways that people have managed to pivot from their routines and devise new ones. When Alicia Ramos lost her job at a clothing factory where she made $410 a week, her options as an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, with limited English skills and health issues, were few. So, three months ago, she started rising at 3:30 a.m. every day to prepare five dozen tamales to sell at a train stop in Brooklyn. She had never attempted street vending, and the first outing was tough. But by the third day, her sales went up. Ms. Ramos, 55, soon added champurrado and arroz con leche to the menu. The venture has been fulfilling financially and emotionally. She’s her own boss now. “We’re hardworking and persevere,” she said of immigrants like her. “The city needs us.” Many others have turned to street vending to sell goods like homemade yogurt, wheels of chicharrón, birria tacos, face masks and hand sanitizer. Some make their way to the open street in Jackson Heights where joggers and dog walkers move with a sense of freedom and airiness. “Within increased isolation you’re still seeing people navigate by building community, which is crazy,” said Justino Rodriguez, 39, a Latin American studies professor who meets a friend every morning for a walk around the concourse. Jim Burke, 54, who helps coordinate events on that street, added: “It shows we crave to make the best of any situation. How do we start over, but not the same? You see that after anything New York has gone through.” That attitude has been apparent in the volunteers rallying around Chinatown, where initially some xenophobia surrounding the coronavirus cut into the already thin margins at shops and restaurants. The offers of help, particularly from Asian-Americans around the city, have meant a resurgence of energy for the area, a cultural institution. “These are immigrant-owned businesses. This is how they started,” said Jennifer Tam, the co-founder of Welcome to Chinatown, a grass-roots initiative established during the pandemic to support businesses. “They’re scrappy and hard-working. Despite the challenges, they feel like there’s a chance.” Entrepreneurs in Manhattan have also been improvising like never before, crushed by the lack of foot traffic and tourists. Liana Pai’s clothing boutique on the Upper West Side, in her family for nearly four decades, did not have a website at the beginning of the pandemic, so she rushed to snap photos of her inventory, sometimes using her daughter as a model. She FaceTimed with customers, parading out shirts and dresses as her husband held the phone up for hours, his arms shaking. She drove to people’s homes to drop off purchases and mailed out boxes of garments that clients could sift through and then decide what to keep. The shop has done about one-third of its usual business, and Ms. Pai, 53, may have to close it soon. But she believes she’ll find a way to reopen somewhere in New York City. “I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else,” she said.
