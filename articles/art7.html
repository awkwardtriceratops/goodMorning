No problem. By Tim Herrera Welcome to the Smarter Living newsletter! Every week, S.L. editor Tim Herrera emails readers with tips and advice for living a better, more fulfilling life.

This is all fine! Whatever your job is, this is going to happen. Pulling yourself out was never particularly easy — as I wrote before here about a year ago — but there used to be a few steps you could take. Find meaning in your work. Change your routine. Learn something new. But in the year since I wrote that, a pandemic upended every aspect of modern life, a racial reckoning swept through society, more than 220,000 have died and hundreds more are dying every day, millions of people have lost their jobs, a relentlessly divisive election season is consuming our attention, and, oh, right, we’re staring down the barrel a bleak, bleak winter. Amid all of this, we’re still expected to work? And that’s if we’re even lucky enough to still have jobs? It’s a lot! So what are we to do? Do those old tricks for busting out still apply? How do we stay motivated right now, seven months into a pandemic with no end in sight? Or, maybe more helpfully: How do we reconcile with the impossibility of maintaining full motivation and productivity as we settle into what will be our normal for the foreseeable future? Of course you feel less motivated in both your work and personal lives — everything has changed, and acting as if we simply adapt and get back to our normal routines and levels of output only makes things worse, experts said. The cultural disruption we’re facing is unlike anything anyone has experienced before. Accepting that it’s OK to not feel as inspired as you did a year ago can help us adjust to this new way of life. “Allow yourself some grace,” said Dr. Danielle Hairston, an assistant professor at the Howard University College of Medicine and the director of its psychiatry residency program. “Change and modify your expectations. Everyone is not starting a new business, a new venture, a new platform, doing new research, a new diet or exercise plan during this time. I think that’s what is portrayed a lot, especially on social media.” She added: “This country is going through a collective grief.” The perception that we’re not doing enough, Dr. Hairston said, can be damaging to our psyches and can be a demotivator in itself. An important step of just getting through the day is to acknowledge that it’s normal and perfectly fine not to be productive or motivated. Indeed, the added stress of feeling like you can’t keep up just compounds the problem and makes you even less motivated and inspired, said Arianna Huffington, the founder and C.E.O. of Thrive Global, which aims to help people deal with burnout and stress. “It’s the productivity paradox: For the last couple of decades, we have just focused on productivity, how do we optimize work flows, how do we have tech tools that make us more productive, how do we get more out of each minute,” she said. “Now what we’re seeing, and there’s some research, is that stress and anxiety kill productivity. So you can have the most optimized work flows and tech tools, but if you’re stressed out of your mind, you’re not going to be as productive.” Beyond that self-acceptance and grace, there are other factors, both internal and external, that impact our resiliency in difficult times. Studies have shown that while personality and life experience can have some impact on your ability to deal with stress, having a support network of friends and family can help people get through periods of trauma and improve our ability to respond to stress. Dr. Hairston said that leaning on those networks can help us process the world around us and give us coping mechanisms for dealing with the constant, ambient stress some people are feeling. “You can still remain connected at a distance,” she said. Dr. Hairston added that even something as simple as a stroll around your neighborhood can help. “It might just be going outside and walking and seeing other people with your mask on. Like, ‘Oh, I am alive, there are other people around.’” she said. “Getting outside and seeing people walking around, just switching up your environment” can help remind you that not everything is doom and gloom.

For many people, it felt like constant chaos, uncertainty and unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety. Everything was happening all the time, and no one had answers or solutions to any of it. But as we settle into more than half a year of this, a different type of stress has crept in, said Liz Fosslien, co-author and illustrator of “No Hard Feelings: The Secret Power of Embracing Emotion at Work.” “Everything has shifted. Now seven months in, every day is Groundhog Day. We’ve swung to the extreme other end of the pendulum. There’s no spark to life,” she said. “It feels like the color has been sucked out of everything.” She went on: “It’s this weird place where we’re doing the same thing every day as the world around us moves faster and faster and faster, and that is just exhausting.”
