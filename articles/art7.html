By Jeneen Interlandi Ms. Interlandi is a member of the editorial board. The deadliest month in American history was an October during a pandemic. In 1918, after waning through the long summer, Spanish flu came roaring back to claim nearly 200,000 lives, just in that one month, just in the United States. Until recently, this second-wave surprise — it was the worst of three to hit the country between 1918 and 1919, most likely because a rare mutation made the virus more deadly — was a bit of obscure medical trivia. But as our current pandemic enters its ninth month, armchair epidemiologists have been wringing their hands over it. Coronaviruses have little in common with influenza viruses. (For one thing, coronaviruses mutate less frequently, and almost never in ways that make them deadlier). But we’re grasping for comparisons because we are living in a fog right now. It’s not the same fog-of-war fog that we experienced in early spring, when airports were flooded in panic, every inanimate object seemed capable of infecting us and nobody could agree on if or when to wear a mask. Things seem much calmer now. But they also remain deeply uncertain. Will we get a safe, effective vaccine? A new president? More and better testing? How will these things change the course of the pandemic? What if they don’t? To be sure, some progress has been made. Rapid antigen tests are finally being deployed, mask-wearing is common in many places, and doctors have grown much more adept at treating the virus’s victims. Thanks to a small roster of drugs and a better understanding of when and how to ventilate Covid-19 patients, Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, estimates that people infected today are roughly 30 percent to 50 percent less likely to die of the virus than they would have been in March or April. But government ineptitude, rampant misinformation and outright lies from our own president are still thwarting efforts to stomp the virus out. We are logging nearly twice as many cases nationally as we did in late spring. And the death toll will soon surpass 200,000. Elderly people and low-income, front-line workers, coming especially from communities of color, make up a disproportionate share of those deaths, meaning that we have done a bad job of protecting our most vulnerable. It’s tough to say how autumn will go, let alone winter. Mathematical models have proven unreliable in part because they are based on previous experience, and when it comes to the novel coronavirus, there is none: Other coronaviruses have leapt into humans, but none have ever caused a pandemic. Scientists also still don’t have enough data to form a full picture of the crisis. The Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch says his efforts to predict how many Covid-19 patients would need intensive care were stymied by a lack of basic information about their average hospital stay. Other experts have noted that there’s no way to tell how many cases are being found through contact tracing as opposed to clinical diagnostics. A recent report on risk factors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention involved just 314 people and concluded that eating at a restaurant or being exposed to someone with the coronavirus might increase your risk of developing Covid-19. “It’s insane that eight months into a global pandemic we still don’t have this kind of basic information,” Mr. Lipsitch says. “It makes for a lot of guesswork.” But there are ways to think about the future of this pandemic — and some are more useful than others. Let’s set aside the wave analogy. Michael T. Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says that it’s far more accurate to think of the pandemic as a forest fire. We have suppressed it in some places, but we have not put it out completely. “It’s going to keep burning as long as it has wood,” he says. “In this case, wood is humans that are susceptible to infection.” It’s safe to assume that case counts will rise in the coming months, as colder weather forces more people indoors (in the North, at least) and as more students and teachers return to in-person schooling. Colleges are already grappling with outbreaks, and infected students are already returning home to seed a further spread in their own communities.
