Fetish<br></h1><p id="artcont">“Material living standards” are not the same thing as “quality of life.” By Oren Cass Mr. Cass is the author of “The Once and Future Worker.” For Americans living through the recent months of crisis, some of the latest economic data may come as a surprise. Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P.) over the past six months remained far above what we could have achieved even a decade ago. Investors have driven key stock indexes back above their February peaks. But rarely have such economic indicators been so entirely beside the point. Seriously: Who cares? What good does G.D.P. do, if people we love are falling seriously ill and dying in unprecedented numbers; if the rhythms of daily life vital to our happiness have gone haywire and our social connections have atrophied? Typically shielded from such problems, the country’s professional class now finds itself experiencing a taste of the insecurity and anxiety that the working class has felt for decades: The dissolution of community; the suddenly prohibitive distances separating friends and family; the anger at experts selling ineffective, poorly planned schooling as adequate to their children’s needs. The calamity we're now all living through offers the professional class an opportunity to reconsider assessments of the national condition issued so confidently pre-pandemic: Economists focus on material living standards partly for ease of quantification, but also because that is what free markets most reliably produce. And for many on the right-of-center especially, a rise in living standards equals success, which conveniently supports the conclusion that the economy has been delivering well. But “material living standards,” measured in dollars of consumption (or inches of flat-screen TV), are not the same thing as “quality of life.” They say little about relationships, dignity, agency, or life satisfaction. Ask yourself what matters to you right now. Consider whether new apps on your smartphone compensate for the loss of control, sense of powerlessness, and strain of unpredictability. We could measure such things if we wanted: We survey “consumer confidence” each month, why not community confidence? We could track how well families are building long-term savings and report the children-with-married-parents rate alongside the unemployment rate. Speaking in March at the Heritage Foundation, Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican said, “many nuclear families are struggling, that families don’t have the community support that they once had, extended families live apart,” and “civil society” is in “decline.” Still, he argued, “the standard of living of middle-class and working class Americans has improved,” citing larger houses, better computers, and cars that are not only safer but also equipped with satellite radio and seat warmers. Weighing these competing factors, he concluded, “For all the problems that we undoubtedly have, the fact is life is better today than it has ever been for the vast majority of the American people.” Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute has gone a step further, assessing “the American dream” itself by material living standards. In his book, “The American Dream Is Not Dead,” published just weeks before the nation went into lockdown because of the coronavirus, Dr. Strain acknowledged that economic measures are not the only ones that matter, but focused on them because they are “so central.” His seventh chapter, “Quality of Life Has Clearly Improved,”leads with the availability of color television, air-conditioning, and affordable long-distance calling, before turning to enjoyment of a daily commute: “My car is so comfortable and I have access to so much entertainment while driving,” he writes. By Senator Toomey’s and Dr. Strain’s standards, the past few months were the greatest in human history to be alive. The pandemic has allowed more time than ever to enjoy air-conditioning and color televisions, computers and phones. One can joy ride for hours streaming podcasts. How much of that technology would you trade to erase the coronavirus? Put another way, how far back in history would you have to travel to find a time when Americans’ true quality of life was lower than today’s? Would it be 1980? 1950? That this is even a question serves as damning refutation of Senator Toomey’s confidence that an improved standard of living more than compensates for weakened family bonds and waning community support. While the right-of-center often dismisses working-class frustration with claims of economic prosperity, the left-of-center tends to dismiss their frustration as backward or racist. Candidate Barack Obama lamented people who “get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren’t like them.” Hillary Clinton placed such people in her “basket of deplorables.” Many Democratic analysts continue to mock the specter of “economic anxiety” as a genuine motivating factor for white voters and assemble analyses explaining away their recent losses. “Actually, these people were motivated by racism. It’s just an important fact of the world,” David Shor, a left-leaning data analyst, said recently in an interview with New York Magazine. According to thinking like this, people can’t rationally reject the buffet of entitlements often suggested as cure-all solutions by progressives. Yet, in this time of coronavirus, Americans from all walks of life can understand that the solution must be to fix problems, not merely compensate for them. Perhaps there is no cure for what ails the working class. Then again, perhaps we will never find an effective Covid-19 vaccine. But that’s no argument against trying. America could slow, or partially reverse, elements of globalization that have most disrupted working-class lives, if that were our priority. We could reorient our education system toward serving the majority of young people who still don’t earn even a community-college degree. We could reform our system of organized labor to provide workers a genuine seat at the table and an institution in the community. We could emphasize geography when we talk about diversity, aiming to distribute talent and investment more widely. These are forms of social redistribution. The task is not to write a larger check but to relinquish power and realign institutions on behalf of those who have been left behind for decades. That has not been a priority for the “haves” anywhere on the political spectrum. But it is necessary if the “have-nots” are to gain autonomy, build community, and find stability. Especially when times are tough, it is those things that we all value most.
