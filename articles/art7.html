Anti-Harassment Official Accused of Racist Rants<br></h1><p id="artcont">The official was relieved of his command after City Council investigators amassed evidence that he posted vitriolic messages online under the name “Clouseau.” By William K. Rashbaum and Alan Feuer For more than 20 years, an online chat board called the Rant has been the place where New York City police officers have gone in secret to complain about their jobs — not infrequently using blatantly racist and misogynistic language. But even by the website’s vitriolic standards, scores of recent posts by a user who calls himself “Clouseau” have been especially disturbing. Between the summer of 2019 and earlier this fall, “Clouseau” posted hundreds of messages on the Rant, many of which attacked Black people, Puerto Ricans, Hasidic Jews and others with an unbridled sense of animus. He referred to former President Barack Obama as a “Muslim savage” and called the Bronx district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, who is Black, “a gap-toothed wildebeest.” Now, city investigators say they have amassed evidence that “Clouseau” is a high-ranking police official. And not just any high-ranking official — the one assigned to an office responsible for combating workplace harassment in the Police Department. The inquiry was conducted by the City Council’s Oversight and Investigations Division, which put together its findings in a 13-page draft report that was obtained by The New York Times. The division is overseen by Councilman Ritchie Torres. The police official, Deputy Inspector James F. Kobel, adamantly denied that he had written the racist messages. The posts have been taken down since the Council began its inquiry, and the profile deleted. “I am unfamiliar with any of these posts,” he said in a brief interview. “I’m unfamiliar with ‘Clouseau.’ I don’t post on the Rant.” He declined to comment further. After The Times asked the Police Department about the posts last month, its Internal Affairs Bureau opened an investigation. Inspector Kobel denied the allegations to his superiors, a police official said. But on Thursday, he was relieved of his command of the Equal Employment Opportunity Division and placed on modified assignment pending completion of the department inquiry. “That is a drastic step, but we thought it was the appropriate step due to the nature of his given assignment as well as the allegations and what we have learned thus far,” the police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, said. He added that the comments posted by “Clouseau” were “utterly disgusting.” Richard Esposito, the deputy commissioner of public information, noted that the investigation, which began three weeks ago, had not yet been completed and that substantial work remained to be done. But Mr. Esposito said “the evidence at this stage points at the police executive,” referring to Inspector Kobel. “Deputy Inspector Kobel has cooperated with the investigation,” he said, “but given the nature of the allegations and the sensitivity of his assignment, the decision has been made to remove him while the investigation proceeds.” At the outset of the Internal Affairs inquiry, Inspector Kobel voluntarily provided investigators with his personal cellphone and computer, and they viewed the postings as not in keeping with his public persona and reputation, the police official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an open investigation. That assessment echoed the appraisals of several current and former co-workers, who said in interviews with The Times that the inspector was quiet, low-key and strait-laced. Police investigators considered the possibility that Inspector Kobel had been framed by someone who had purposely peppered the posts with details about his life — many, if not most, of which could be found through research on the internet. But the inquiry turned up more evidence that pointed to Inspector Kobel, the police official said, including an email on his personal computer from the Rant message board that acknowledged his screen name was “Clouseau.” Police investigators also found on his personal cellphone a copy of the digital photo the anonymous writer used on the message board as an avatar — a picture of the Peter Sellers character Inspector Clouseau from the film “The Pink Panther.” Inspector Kobel, 50, has served in several senior positions on the force during his nearly 30-year career and currently oversees a unit responsible “for the prevention and investigation of employment and harassment claims,” according to its website. Councilman Torres said his investigative team had compared posts from the Rant with public information and determined that Inspector Kobel and “Clouseau” share “a number of specific professional and personal characteristics.”
