It happens to be one of the assets he and his wife are disputing in lawsuits over their divorce. By Alexandra Alter Ever since his breakout with “The Da Vinci Code,” the novelist Dan Brown has been renowned for his twisty, adrenaline-fueled yet cerebral plots involving cryptography, symbology, smart and sexy lady sidekicks, secret and violent religious cults, and unhinged zealots bent on mass murder and destruction. His new book, on the other hand, features a mouse conductor who recruits a menagerie of animals to perform in an orchestra, while delivering proverbs about the virtues of fortitude, patience and cooperation. (Its target audience is children ages 3 to 7.) It will be released this week alongside a classical music album for children, called “Wild Symphony,” that was composed by Mr. Brown and based on songs he self-produced some 30 years ago, back when he was an aspiring musician in his 20s — long before he had published any novels. At that time, Mr. Brown, who is now 56, recorded the songs using synthesizers in his tiny studio. He made about 500 cassettes (and booklets of poetry) and sold them on consignment at his local bookstore. The newly released album features updated versions of the original songs along with new ones, all performed and recorded by the Zagreb Festival Orchestra in Croatia. It’s an unexpected professional detour after Mr. Brown’s seven thrillers, which collectively have more than 234 million copies in print, and have made him a multimillionaire. “Wild Symphony” is also, somewhat awkwardly, an unexpected item of contention in a messy legal battle between Mr. Brown and his ex-wife, Blythe Brown, after their divorce last year. In a complaint filed this summer, Ms. Brown claimed that her former husband misrepresented their assets during the divorce proceedings, and lists “Wild Symphony” as one of several projects that she claims he failed to disclose when they separated. She also alleged that he led “a secret life” for years, hiding an affair with a Dutch horse trainer and concealing lavish purchases he made for his mistress, including two Friesian horses, one of them named Da Vinci. (The other horse was a “highly coveted, prizewinning Friesian” black stallion named “Limited Edition” that cost $345,000, according to her complaint.) Mr. Brown filed a countersuit for libel and slander, among other claims, on July 30, arguing that his former wife set out to “publicly shame him” and “destroy his legacy.” “Any implication or claim that I lied or hid money is absolutely false,” Mr. Brown said during a recent interview. “I’m actually utterly shocked that she chose to do this.” Mr. Brown spoke to me over video on a recent August afternoon from the cavernous, baroque library of his home in Rye Beach, N.H., a short drive from where he grew up, on the campus of the boarding school Phillips Exeter, where his father taught mathematics. His cat, Zeus, snoozed on the floor. Dressed in a pale pink button down, he showed me a secret chamber behind a revolving bookcase that revealed a shelf with the first book he ever wrote, at age 5, titled “The Giraffe, the Pig, and the Pants On Fire,” as well as the Steinway B piano where he pursues his hobby and first professional aspiration: formulating musical compositions. To gain access to his recording studio, where he has a synthesizer hooked up to a computer, he presses the corner of a painting — a canvas depicting a Victorian woman sitting in a garden — and a hidden door swings open. The walls of the studio are decorated with gold records he received for blowout sales of his German-language audiobooks — not quite what he had in mind when he set out to become a musician, but “I’ll take it,” he said. Mr. Brown’s musical process goes like this: He composes on his piano, trying out melodies and building them into a piece that he memorizes. He plays the song on a piano keyboard that’s hooked up to a computer, creates a digital file, then uses a sequencing program that allows him to add instrumentation, assigning the musical lines to different instruments. Then, usually, the music stays in its digital vault. But two years ago, when Mr. Brown was in Shanghai to promote his 2017 novel, “Origin,” he was asked on television about an old, long-forgotten project.
