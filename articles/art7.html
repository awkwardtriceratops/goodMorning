By Sabrina Imbler Earlier this week, and more than 2,700 feet underwater by the northern Great Barrier Reef, a remotely operated vehicle named SuBastian engaged in a stare-off with a burrito. That’s what the creature looked like from a distance: an untoasted cylinder floating eerily upright in the ocean’s twilight zone, like takeout from Triton. Above the waves, in the control room of a Schmidt Ocean Institute research vessel, the pilot, Jason Rodriguez, and the co-pilot, Kris Ingram, navigated SuBastian closer to the unidentified floating object, which spurted and wiggled away several times before coming into focus. The animal was about as long as a breakfast sausage, with wafer-thin fins and one large, searching eye. “What on earth?” muttered Dhugal Lindsay, who was sipping his morning coffee in his office at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, or Jamstec, in Kanagawa. Dr. Lindsay, a marine biologist, had Zoomed in to narrate a YouTube livestream, which had already spotted a 16-tentacled jellyfish and an Apolemia siphonophore, a colonial animal that resembles a string of fairy lights. Dr. Lindsay’s Zoom feed was fuzzy, and the burrito creature initially seemed a mystery. The day before, SuBastian had discovered a coral reef taller than the Empire State Building, leaving the lead scientists caught up in back-to-back interviews in the other room. So Valerie Cornet, a master’s student in marine biology at James Cook University, subbed in to narrate alongside Dr. Lindsay. Just before the creature wiggled offscreen, Ms. Cornet speculated that it could be a squid. Meanwhile, at about 10:30 p.m. in Washington, D.C., Mike Vecchione was getting ready for bed. A zoologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Dr. Vecchione had been watching SuBastian’s dive but called it a day when the feed glitched. Suddenly, he recalled, a phone buzzed with a message from a colleague, the biologist Christopher Mah: “Mike Vecchione, they’re calling you on the squid phone.” When Dr. Vecchione got a good look at the image, he knew exactly what it was: Spirula spirula, or the ram’s horn squid. Spirula is the only living squid to have an internal coiled shell, which it tucks under the fleshy flaps of its rear end, according to Jay C. Hunt, a biologist at East Stroudsburg University. The squid can also emit lime-green light from a large photophore, also located on its behind. Dr. Vecchione and other experts were astonished. For ages, biologists and beachgoers had stumbled upon the thumbnail-white shells of Spirula stranded on shores around the world. But no one had ever seen the animal alive in its natural habitat. “It’s been this mystery animal,” said Rebecca Helm, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Asheville, who was one of the excited scientists tweeting about Spirula. “It’s like the pixie-size version of the giant squid.” Chong Chen, a biologist at Jamstec, said, “This may indeed be the first time a live animal has been caught on camera in its natural habitat.” Although the Spirula sighting may be a scientific first, it did not make a strong initial impression on the researchers onboard. “We’ve seen bobtail squids and dumbo octopuses where we say, ‘Wow, this is the cutest thing,’” Ms. Cornet said. “This one was weird-looking, and looking at us with its weird eye.”
