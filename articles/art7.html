So why is Congress still holding hearings on it? By Ashish Jha Dr. Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, testified at a Senate hearing last week about hydroxychloroquine. There was a super-spreader event last week in the United States Senate. It wasn’t the coronavirus, however, that was spreading, but misinformation. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing about early treatment for Covid-19. Yet instead of a robust discussion about promising emerging therapies or what Congress might do to accelerate such treatments, the conversation was all about the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. That’s right. Almost nine months into the pandemic, during a surge, with 1,500 daily deaths, senators saw fit to rehash a medical dead end. Trial after trial has found no evidence that hydroxychloroquine improves outcomes for Covid-19 patients; some studies have found that it causes more harm than good. The hearing and the theater around it are a window into the disinformation campaigns that have hobbled our national response to the crisis and undermined belief in science. The purpose of congressional hearings is to inform policy with evidence and analysis from expert witnesses. For those of us whose life’s work is the production and evaluation of data, participation is a highlight — a chance to help shape the national debate. But this hearing, at which I testified, was different. Neither Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican senator who is the chairman of the committee, nor his chosen witnesses — three doctors who have pushed hydroxychloroquine — displayed more than a passing interest in evidence. Intuition and the personal experiences of individual doctors were acclaimed as guiding principles. The history of medicine is littered with snake-oil salesmen who championed useless or harmful treatments based on personal experience. Early in the pandemic, President Trump referred to hydroxychloroquine as a “game changer,” declaring himself “a big fan.” Asked why he was so enthusiastic about it, Mr. Trump said, “I feel good about it.”
