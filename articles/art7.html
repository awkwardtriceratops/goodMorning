No surprise there. They reach for that stew every fall, it seems, and every time the national mood is unsettled, every time there’s bad news amid the good. “Long before there were antidepressants,” as Regina Schrambling wrote in 2001, after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, “there was stew.” (Try her exemplary beef stew with Dijon and Cognac.) Halloween’s tomorrow, and it’s going to be a strange and spooky one this year, amid the pandemic. Daylight Saving Time ends on Sunday, bringing darkness to our afternoons. Election Day is Tuesday, and that’s going to be a lot no matter whom you support. You’d be forgiven if you spent the weekend huddled up on the couch surfing news sites. But maybe you could join the hordes and make stew instead? Molly’s is great, as is Regina’s. So is Roy Choi’s galbijjim, and Gavin Kaysen’s pot roast and Sarah DiGregorio’s pressure cooker Guinness beef stew with horseradish cream. Not a meat eater? There’s Amanda Cohen’s charred cauliflower stew. Also David Tanis’s mushroom stew. And Martha Rose Shulman’s collard greens tagine. Baking’s restorative, too, and offers the pleasure of following a recipe to delicious completion: salted maple pie, say, or a berry apple butter pie. You could make chocolate chip cookies with honey-roasted almonds and chile, or just dip some caramel apples in advance of a screening of “Get Out.” That’s a nice weekend night. Venturing beyond the Dutch oven, I’d also like to make this cheesy baked pumpkin pasta with kale in the next couple of days. Also, vegan mapo tofu, and maybe braised chicken with rosemary, chickpeas and salted lemon. Thousands and thousands more recipes to cook right now await you on NYT Cooking.
