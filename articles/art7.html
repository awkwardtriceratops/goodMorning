A Generation of Athletes Followed.<br></h1><p id="artcont">More games were halted in basketball, baseball and hockey, and the messages from athletes reverberated beyond the sports world. By Marc Stein, Sopan Deb and Alan Blinder LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — George Hill is hardly the biggest star in professional basketball. But he was the one who took the lead when a handful of players on the Milwaukee Bucks began talking about the police shooting of Jacob Blake a few days earlier in Wisconsin. The players, led by Hill, implored their teammates not to play in their playoff game on Wednesday, believing they had a responsibility to make a statement about the how the police treat Black people. What they envisioned — a one game, on-the-fly protest — instead inspired one of the broadest political statements across sports leagues that the United States had ever seen: walkouts involving hundreds of athletes in professional men’s and women’s basketball, baseball and soccer, as well as one of the world’s biggest stars in tennis. LeBron James, basketball’s most famous athlete, said on Twitter that change “happens with action and needs to happen NOW!” President Trump, who had previously attacked the league and had publicly sparred with James, said people were “a little tired of the N.B.A.” By Thursday afternoon, the N.B.A. players had pledged to return to play, according to three people who were part of the discussions and spoke on condition of anonymity because final details of a comeback had not been worked out. “We are hopeful to resume games either Friday or Saturday,” a league spokesman, Mike Bass, said in a statement. But the players’ message was still echoing — within and well beyond the world of sports, perhaps to greater effect than ever before. More baseball, hockey and basketball games were called off on Thursday, along with football practices and other events as athletes urged greater focus on conversations about racism and police brutality. Basketball players, especially women, have been at the forefront of discussions and demonstrations about social injustice for years. That has morphed amid the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, and the shooting of Blake, a Black man who was shot in the back multiple times by the police in Kenosha, Wis., as he tried to enter his vehicle. Following their walkout, Bucks players, led by Hill and his teammate Sterling Brown, called for elected officials in Wisconsin to take concrete steps to hold the police officers accountable for how they treated Blake. “For this to occur, it’s imperative for the Wisconsin state Legislature to reconvene after months of inaction and take up meaningful measures to address issues of police accountability, brutality and criminal justice reform,” Hill said. The walkouts drew the attention of several prominent political figures. Among the first to weigh in was former President Barack Obama, who has personal relationships with several N.B.A. players. He praised the Bucks in a tweet on Wednesday “for standing up for what they believe in.” The reaction from White House was much more critical. Along with Trump’s comments, Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and one of his senior advisers, said on CNBC, “I think that the N.B.A. players are very fortunate that they have the financial position where they’re able to take a night off from work without having to have the consequences to themselves financially.” Several N.B.A. and W.N.B.A. players have increased their social justice efforts and gotten more involved in politics in recent months. Carmelo Anthony, the Portland Trail Blazers forward, Chris Paul, the All-Star Oklahoma City Thunder guard, and Dwyane Wade, the retired N.B.A. star, teamed up to form the Social Change Fund, a philanthropic effort that will aim to to invest in organizations that support people of color. James and other top athletes formed More Than a Vote to protect voting rights and conduct outreach to Black voters. Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors guard, appeared in a video at the Democratic National Convention in support of Joseph R. Biden Jr., the party’s presidential nominee. Renee Montgomery, who plays for the W.N.B.A.’s Atlanta Dream, skipped the season altogether to focus on social justice efforts. And in another extraordinary move, the entire Atlanta team and others in the league publicly endorsed an opponent of Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican from Georgia who is a co-owner of the Dream, because she criticized the Black Lives Matter movement and the efforts of W.N.B.A. players to focus their season on social activism. Earlier this month, the N.B.A.’s owners, many of them billionaires, said they would donate $300 million over 10 years — roughly $1 million per year for every team — to a fund “dedicated to creating greater economic empowerment in the Black community,” according to a news release. It was not immediately clear whether the N.B.A. players would ask for a greater commitment from the owners as a result of the walkout. Tilman Fertitta, the owner of the Houston Rockets, said on CNBC that he did not think that the stoppage was directed at the league’s owners. “I think they just needed a pause,” Fertitta said Thursday. “They’ve been playing every other day. These are our partners, OK? We’re 50-50 partners. And if we do well, they do well. And if the league doesn’t do well, none of us do well. And they realize that.” With basketball games called off on Thursday, the prior day’s insurgency led professional and college teams in other sports to hurriedly scratch their plans, too. In baseball, the Oakland Athletics elected not to compete against the Texas Rangers on Thursday, and at least four more games — Boston at Toronto, Philadelphia at Washington, Minnesota at Detroit and Baltimore at Tampa Bay — were postponed. In a statement, the Oakland players said that “social injustice and systemic racism have been part of the fabric of our lives for too long” and described their decision not to play as “the first step in our relentless pursuit for meaningful change.” Ron Rivera, the coach of the professional football team in Washington, a franchise with a troubled history on race, said the day would be reserved for “reflection instead” of football. The New York Jets, the Indianapolis Colts and the Green Bay Packers were among the teams that also canceled practices. Troy Vincent, the N.F.L.’s head of football operations and the highest ranking Black person at the league office, spoke tearfully on ESPN Radio about his fears for his three sons and his support for the baseball and basketball players who sat out games. “I’m sitting up here every day having a conversation about contact tracing and how we’re going to play ball,” Vincent said, referring to the league’s preparations for the season during the pandemic. “And I’ve got a 22-year-old and a 20-year-old and a 15-year-old that I’m trying to prevent from being hunted, and their teachable moment and I’m trusting my Lord, trusting him. I’m just — I’m proud of what the guys and the women are doing.” Boston College, Kentucky and South Florida abandoned plans for football practices on Thursday, unsurprising moves toward the end of an unusually vibrant off-season of activism by college athletes. “What happened to Jacob Blake is history repeating itself,” Max Richardson, a linebacker at Boston College, wrote on Twitter. “These countless tragedies are reoccurring. There can be no more ignorance. Changes WILL come. And our team will know/acknowledge the history of oppression.” Playoff hockey games that were scheduled for Thursday and Friday were also postponed. It was not always clear how long the various teams and players would keep their sports activities on pause. Four baseball teams that had protested on Wednesday resumed play on Thursday, and Naomi Osaka, a Black woman who has won two Grand Slam titles, said she would play in the Western & Southern Open’s semifinals on Friday. Osaka had planned to quit the tournament because there were “more important matters at hand,” but she relented after tennis officials agreed to delay matches by a day. “They offered to postpone all matches until Friday and in my mind that brings more attention to the movement,” Osaka said. By the end of Thursday, some in sports said they were already turning to political action beyond demonstrations. Mike Krzyzewski, the men’s basketball coach at Duke, told a rally of athletes that his players would register to vote later in the day. “This thing can be won, and your generation is the generation that’s going to do it,” he said without endorsing any particular candidate. “I grew up a long time ago in the ’60s. I thought it was headed in the right direction. Damn, I was wrong. I want to be right.” Marc Stein reported from Lake Buena Vista, Sopan Deb from New York and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.
