Here’s what you should know. By Marie Tae McDermott Good morning. Over the weekend, reports and images surfaced of unauthorized ballot drop boxes that were fraudulently labeled “official” in Los Angeles, Fresno and Orange Counties. On Monday, California’s secretary of state, Alex Padilla, made it clear that unofficial drop boxes are illegal and can lead to voter fraud. “Misleading voters is wrong regardless of who is doing it,” Mr. Padilla said in a conference call with reporters. Republican officials admitted to purchasing and placing the boxes near churches, gun shops and Republican Party offices in conservative areas across the state. Mr. Padilla and Attorney General Xavier Becerra sent a cease-and-desist order to the state- and county-level Republican parties, ordering them to remove the boxes immediately. More than 50 boxes had been placed over the weekend before they became public, but party officials said they bought about 100 total in an attempt to boost turnout. Hector Barajas, a spokesman for the California Republican Party, said that the party would continue to distribute the boxes, which he referred to as “our ballot harvesting program.”
