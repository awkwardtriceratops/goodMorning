Her new Netflix special showcases her in sketches that find horror in comedy. By Jason Zinoman Was Donald Trump good for comedy? The comic Lewis Black recently answered this persistent question with an understandable tone of exhaustion, saying the president is “good for comedy in the way a stroke is good for a nap.” Poking fun at President Trump is both difficult (how do you parody someone who already seems like one?) and way too easy, since any joke about “the orange man in the White House” gets cheap laughs, if not an applause break. Too many stand-ups these days pander to their base. And yet, some comics have flourished during the Trump era, none more so than Sarah Cooper, a breakout star whose online videos reinvigorated the tradition of the presidential impression. Responding to the latest events with the metabolism of cable news, she lip-syncs snippets of the president’s speeches or interviews from her apartment, in her own clothes, with no attempt to mimic his look. She didn’t try to imitate him so much as capture a buffoonish essence, zeroing in on moments where the juxtaposition between cluelessness and confidence was most stark. Her fans range from kids to grandparents, and her success has now led to a glossy Netflix production, “Everything’s Fine” (which premiered Tuesday), a celebrity-rich, intermittently funny sketch show that hangs on a narrative of apocalyptic doom. Cooper plays a chipper morning talk-show host struggling to maintain her smile as the world around her unravels. It’s history that starts as comedy and ends as horror. Directed with slow-burn dread by Natasha Lyonne, this paranoid production has the feel of a comic update of “Network,” and there’s even a nod to that classic movie, but instead of enraged citizens yelling that they are mad as hell, Cooper plays a character whose anger is repressed and who just keeps taking it until she hides underneath her desk.
