Most children will not start remote classes until that date. By Eliza Shapiro, Dana Rubinstein and Emma G. Fitzsimmons New York City is delaying the start of its school year by 10 days, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Tuesday, as part of a deal to avert a teachers’ strike and calm principals and parents anxious about the start of in-person classes. The city’s 1.1 million children will not have any in-person classes until Sept. 21. Most children will not start remote classes until that date. The delay is intended to give principals and administrators more time to prepare for the most closely-watched reopening effort in the country. School leaders, teachers, elected officials and union bosses have been raising alarms for weeks, with increasing urgency, about the system’s readiness for reopening. New York’s school district, the nation’s largest, is the only one in a major U.S. city that is planning to reopen its schools in-person this month. Mr. de Blasio has insisted that classrooms would reopen this fall, a promise that has not been made by leaders of other big cities. Mr. de Blasio had spent weeks resisting calls to delay school reopening. He had argued that the system’s mostly low-income, Black and Latino students urgently needed in-person classes, an assertion widely supported by education experts. New York has an enormous population of vulnerable public schoolchildren who have been largely failed by remote learning: The city has some 200,000 children with disabilities, and 114,000 homeless students. But the mayor’s insistence that schools would be ready to reopen as originally scheduled on Sept. 10 frustrated many teachers and principals, who said they did not believe Mr. de Blasio understood the depth of the challenges they faced on the ground. Getting personal protective gear and sufficient soap and hand sanitizer into the city’s public school buildings is only a first step. Educators raised concerns about ventilation in aging school buildings and said they did not understand how often they or their students should be tested. And beyond safety concerns, principals said they did not have enough information or support to essentially create two complementary versions of school: one in-person and one online. Throughout the summer, principals already facing budget cuts did not know how many children would actually report to school, or how many staff they would have to teach students in the building and online. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
