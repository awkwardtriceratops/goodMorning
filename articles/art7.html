France’s Schools Remain Open.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Many European nations have managed to flatten the coronavirus surge while keeping schools open, reducing academic and economic disruption. By Norimitsu Onishi, Constant Méheut and Antonella Francini PARIS — As a second lockdown appeared inevitable amid skyrocketing coronavirus infections, the scientists advising the French government in October warned that keeping students in their classrooms meant it would take longer to tame the surge. The government kept the schools open anyway, even as the country became an epicenter of the second wave of the coronavirus in Europe. French leaders decided that they would try to subdue the surge, while also trying to minimize economic and academic damage by keeping children learning where they do it best: in school. Five weeks into a second nationwide lockdown, France, like much of Europe, has proved that it is possible to bring the rate of known infections down, even with schools open. It is a lesson that has been taken up late in the United States, where Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities, have made it a priority to keep bars and restaurants open — though not necessarily for indoor service or at full capacity — even as they have closed their schools. Many European countries, including France, have made the opposite choice: keeping schools open but closing restaurants and bars. In France, 11 percent of coronavirus tests are coming back positive but students have kept going to school, while New York City shut its public schools on Nov. 19, after the positive test rate reached 3 percent. But recent studies have shown that young children, at least, are low transmitters of the virus, and at least some American officials are reconsidering their approach: Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York abruptly decided on Sunday to reopen elementary schools while keeping upper grades closed, and other districts around the country have made or announced similar moves. Allowing schools to remain open has been one of the most significant departures from Europe’s initial lockdowns last spring. “The first lockdown was horrible,” said Marine Huguenin, who was watching her two daughters play at a Paris park, which was filled with strollers and masked parents after school on a recent afternoon. During the earlier lockdown, the entire family was stuck inside, she said, with Ms. Huguenin and her husband looking after their children during the day, then catching up on work between 9:30 p.m. and 1 a.m. The numbers tell the story of France’s progress so far. In early November, the number of new cases in France in a seven-day period soared to more than 80 per 100,000 people; as of Sunday it had dropped to 17 per 100,000. “Obviously, the decline has been slower because schools are open, but we had to find a middle ground,” said Yazdan Yazdanpanah, an infectious disease specialist and a member of France’s Scientific Council, which advises the government on the pandemic. But, he added, the slower drop in infections has been offset by positive effects on education, mental health and the economy. The trade-off has been generally well-accepted in an otherwise contentious lockdown during which an increasing number of people have challenged restrictions on movement and business. In Paris, keeping schools open has shifted the mood in a city that lived through one of the world’s strictest lockdowns in the spring.
