By Lisa Lerer For much of the summer, President Trump argued that Joseph R. Biden Jr. was scared to debate him, reliant on performance-enhancing drugs and barely able to remain upright for 90 minutes because of his purportedly failing health. That was then. Now, Mr. Trump is receiving medication to treat a case of a virus he has failed to control, and he has become the candidate casting doubt on his participation in the next debate. After the Commission on Presidential Debates announced plans to hold next week’s town hall virtually, Mr. Trump threatened to skip the event entirely, plunging the two campaigns into a daylong debate over debates. The president’s central concern: the possibility of a mute button. “I’m not going to waste my time on a virtual debate,” he told Fox News. “You sit behind a computer and do a debate — it’s ridiculous, and then they cut you off whenever they want.” The White House’s approach to avoiding accountability for its record is becoming clearer than ever: to distract, interrupt and even blow up debates that might focus attention on Mr. Trump’s handling of the virus and other issues. The strategy was on vivid display Wednesday night, when Vice President Mike Pence repeatedly interrupted Senator Kamala Harris and talked over the moderator, Susan Page, ignoring rules about speaking time. While Mr. Pence’s behavior paled in comparison to the barrage of hectoring from Mr. Trump during the first presidential debate, it was a notable deviation from the norm. Mr. Pence, a soft-spoken former governor, frequently takes on the role of the polite neighbor minding his own business amid the leaf-blowing din of the Trump administration.
