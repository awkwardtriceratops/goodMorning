The devices are widely used, but the N.Y.P.D. does not give them to patrol officers. By Ali Watkins Shortly before Daniel Prude lost consciousness while the Rochester police held him down, one of the officers had pulled a white hood from his pocket and slipped it over Mr. Prude’s head. The mesh hood is a common device that the police and correction officers use, known as a “spit hood” or “spit sock.” It was intended to keep Mr. Prude, who had been spitting on the ground, from exposing them to disease. Earlier that night, Mr. Prude, who had a history of mental illness, had run out of his brother’s home naked and was behaving erratically, telling at least one person that he had the coronavirus, according to police reports. The officers went on to hold Mr. Prude down on the pavement for two minutes, his head still wrapped in the sack, as he lost consciousness and his pulse stopped. Paramedics restarted his heart, but he died a week later in a hospital. An autopsy found the cause of death was “complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint.” Mr. Prude’s death, along with the jarring body camera footage of him being subdued, has brought new scrutiny to the longstanding use of spit hoods and similar devices by law enforcement. A spit hood, or spit guard, is a loose, breathable fabric sack that can be placed over a person’s head to prevent them from biting or spitting. There are many designs, but the hoods usually are made of a porous, breathable fabric, often a mesh that allows officers to see the suspect’s face. Many hoods have an elastic band designed to stay loosely secured around a person’s neck. The devices are intended to keep an emotionally disturbed person from biting or spitting on an officer, not just to prevent the spread of diseases but also to avoid other injuries. “People quite frankly underestimate the level of danger that officers can face from individuals that are using their mouths and their teeth,” said Maria Haberfield, a professor of policing science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, in New York City. The coronavirus pandemic — and the risk that officers could be infected by a suspect’s saliva — have drawn attention to the use of spit hoods, though it is difficult to track whether use of the devices has increased in the last six months. The use of spit hoods or spit shields is widespread among medics, prison guards and the police, throughout the United States and internationally. Authorities in many European countries use the device to shield themselves from infectious diseases, and many American police departments also employ them as a restraining device. Scotland Yard announced last year that it would supply all officers with spit hoods; the Garda, Ireland’s national police force, began deploying the device more widely early this year. Most police departments in the United States have them on hand. Policies on spit masks vary among major police departments; some will not allow the devices to be used on children, or on a person who has been pepper-sprayed. Chris Petzer, the owner of Handcuff Warehouse, a Virginia-based law enforcement equipment company that supplies spit hoods, said the emergence of the coronavirus has only heightened the growing demand for the devices. Spit hoods are more often used by corrections officers, in prisons and jails, Mr. Petzer said, and many police departments do not issue them to patrol officers. The New York Police Department is one of the departments that does not give spit guards to patrol officers, a spokesman, Al Baker, said. Because of the coronavirus epidemic, however, the department has begun issuing them to emergency services officers, who are also trained as medics, on a trial basis, Mr. Baker said. Updated September 1, 2020 A medical study published in 2019 found the use of a spit hood produced “no clinically significant changes” in a person’s ability to breathe, provided he or she was healthy. “Most of the time, they are safe unless a person has an underlying condition,” Ms. Haberfield said.
