By Robin Pogrebin An independent investigation into how the Guggenheim Museum handled last year’s exhibition on the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat has concluded there is no evidence that the show’s guest curator, Chaédria LaBouvier, who is Black, “was subject to adverse treatment on the basis of her race,” the museum announced on Thursday. The museum simultaneously announced that Nancy Spector, the artistic director and chief curator, who is white, was leaving “to pursue other curatorial endeavors and to finish her doctoral dissertation.” She has spent 34 years at the Guggenheim and has been publicly criticized by Ms. LaBouvier, who did not participate in the investigation. The announcement comes at a time when many cultural institutions are defending themselves against charges of racism and have committed to reform. The Black Lives Matter Movement has raised awareness in the art world about inequity in hiring, programming and governance. The Guggenheim’s three-month investigation, conducted by the law firm Kramer Levin, was prompted by criticism from employees who sent a letter to management in June, describing “an inequitable work environment that enables racism, white supremacy, and other discriminatory practices.” In particular, the comments appended to the letter criticized how the Guggenheim handled Ms. LaBouvier, an art historian who was the first solo Black curator of an exhibition at the museum. “The museum cannot be taken seriously as a good faith actor in its commitment to affirming diversity,” the letter said, “without grappling honestly and humbly with its failure in regards to the treatment of Chaédria LaBouvier.” In the wake of the letter, Ms. Spector on July 1 went on a three-month sabbatical. The museum responded by hiring the law firm to independently investigate the allegations. It also announced it was developing a diversity program, which the museum approved in August, to create policies for reporting discrimination and implement new measures like paid internship opportunities for students from underrepresented backgrounds. It was unclear whether Ms. Spector resigned by choice or was forced out. Neither the Guggenheim nor Ms. Spector would discuss the terms of her departure. “The Guggenheim is thankful to Nancy for her nearly 35 years of service," Richard Armstrong, the museum’s director, said in a statement. “Nancy has provided leadership and strategic vision for collections, exhibitions and public programs.”
