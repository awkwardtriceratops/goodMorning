Sumter was steaming off the coast of Vietnam, a Marine onboard dropped the needle on the turntable in front of him, sending music to the loudspeakers bolted to the bulkheads in the cavernous spaces where hundreds of sailors and Marines slept and hung out. Some members of the crew were not ready for what they heard. “Sun, up down. On the corner, uptown. I turn around and hear the sound. A voice is talking about who’s gonna die next. Cause the white man’s got a God complex.” Though nobody knew it at the moment, that song was about to set off a series of events that would leave three Black Marines facing charges of mutiny and the possibility of execution or lengthy imprisonment. Others were at risk of being thrown out of the Marine Corps with discharges that would maim their job prospects in civilian America for the rest of their lives. They were caught up in events that were not only about race but also about structural racism; not just a matter of individuals and personalities but of a U.S. military establishment that treated people of color differently from white service members — starting with recruitment and induction, through combat deployments, right on through the charges and punishments that arose when conflicts boiled over. The Marine spinning records that day was Pfc. Alexander Jenkins Jr., a 19-year-old from Newport News, Va., whose outgoing personality had earned him a turn as the ship’s D.J. During tedious weeks at sea, music was one way to pass the time, but while Black Marines listened to songs by white artists with no complaints, some white service members were not so open in their tastes. Jenkins quickly found himself under verbal attack from white sergeants and officers — part of a campaign of harassment and poor treatment that included mess cooks intentionally handing him and his friends cold and inedible food, surprise uniform inspections and capricious punishments from noncommissioned officers. Eventually, it escalated to Black and white Marines physically fighting each other on a ship at sea. Jenkins kept playing the newest records and tapes he could find by Black artists, many of which reflected the antiwar and Black-liberation movements happening at home, alongside country and western albums and hits by the Beatles. “I was playing ‘What’s Going On’ by Marvin Gaye, and I was playing ‘Bring the Boys Home’ by Freda Payne,” Jenkins recalls. “But playing ‘White Man’s Got a God Complex’ by the Last Poets really set the white guys off.” Jenkins remembers being pulled into a small room on the ship and questioned by a group of higher-ranking white Marines about the Harlem-based hip-hop pioneers’ spoken-word song, which touched on poverty, prostitution, drugs, the military-industrial complex, white supremacy and the killings of Native Americans and Blacks. They accused Jenkins of playing music that would incite a riot. “If you don’t have a God complex, then this doesn’t apply to you, now does it?” Jenkins told them. “But if you do have a God complex, then you’ve got to listen,” he added. A white Marine captain jumped out of his chair so forcefully that it flipped over. “You think you’re so smart, don’t you?” the Marine screamed in Jenkins’s face. “I’m sorry, sir. I really don’t understand,” Jenkins countered. “It’s a damn record, OK? It’s got a nice beat.” Jenkins was incensed, but he decided against pushing things much further. “I didn’t want to get shot without a trial,” he recalled. Despite Jenkins’s attempt to keep tensions from escalating, relations between white and Black Marines aboard the Sumter were about to get much worse. Put into service just two years earlier, the Sumter steamed off the coast of Vietnam with more than 150 Marines from a hodgepodge of different units from the American bases on Okinawa, Japan. Among them were Black servicemen who had been pushed to become truck drivers or infantry troops because of racial bias in assessment tests. They were part of a quick-reaction force that could be put ashore anywhere along the coast to fight the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army should the need arise. Until that time, though, they waited. Even as the Marine Corps publicly announced efforts to reduce racist attacks within the ranks, harassment, mistreatment and violence against Blacks was commonplace and accepted, both in the United States (on bases like Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, where the Ku Klux Klan posted a billboard reading “This Is Klan Country” on a nearby highway) and on its outposts in Okinawa and elsewhere. The more besieged the Black Marines on the Sumter felt, the tighter they drew together for mutual support and protection. But such security was ephemeral. Jenkins and two of his close friends were about to have their young lives upended by an incident that was hardly reported and remained almost invisible to the public. The three Marines became little more than statistics in the Corps’s dismal record of race relations in the Vietnam era. [Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.] Trouble had already flared up in July outside the gates of the U.S. Navy’s base in Subic Bay, Philippines, during a port call. There, in the town of Olongapo, sailors and Marines availed themselves of every kind of vice in the de facto racially segregated entertainment district. Black Marines and sailors tended to hang out in a neighborhood called the Jungle, while their white counterparts had the run of the bars and brothels elsewhere. An investigation by the director of naval intelligence mentioned “racial incidents” between whites and Blacks during Sumter’s port visit there, where fistfights in the streets and bars were not unusual. Sailors and Marines used the port visit to bring a fresh supply of marijuana and heroin onto the ship for some diversion during long days at sea. Back on the ship, white officers harassed Black Marines for minor infractions involving their hair and uniforms. Tight quarters left little room for the men to blow off steam, and small routine squabbles soon escalated. The ship’s radio station — the loudspeaker system Jenkins played music on in the evenings — was one of the few sources of entertainment, and now even that became a point of contention. Days after Jenkins was reprimanded, larger and more intense fights among the Marines broke out. There are varying accounts of what happened and why. Black and white Marines alike recall that a series of fistfights throughout the deployment increased in frequency in the early days of September on Sumter. In interviews with The Times, a half-dozen sailors and Marines who were on the Sumter recalled these fights — some started by whites, others by Blacks. The Marines’ leadership, however, zeroed in on Jenkins, along with Pfc. Roy L. Barnwell and Lance Cpl. James S. Blackwell, as the “ringleaders” who were instigating general unrest and resistance to their orders. After Jenkins was told he couldn’t play the Last Poets, 64 of the 65 Black Marines on the ship submitted an informal complaint to the highest-ranking Marine officer on board, Capt. John B. Krueger, according to an account written a few months afterward by the defense team that Jenkins, Barnwell and Blackwell soon needed. In their note, the Black Marines told Krueger that they were being denied the right to play their own music. “Being that races are different in certain aspects, and music being one,” it read, “then the proper officials must make way as to the satisfaction of each and every race regardless of minority.” The Marines then submitted a request for a formal meeting with their battalion commander, who was located on another ship nearby. It was denied, further inflaming interactions between the men on board.
