New Yorkers Are Steeling Themselves<br></h1><p id="artcont">As the number of virus cases rises, anxious residents are taking precautions and making sure they are prepared this time. By Michael Wilson A father of three in Brooklyn is back to stockpiling medicine and rubbing alcohol. A publicist has put her plan to return to her office in Manhattan on hold indefinitely. And a mother in Central Park has again — and again — delayed taking her 15-month-old daughter back to the toddler music classes she loved. “Big groups of kids, we’re not doing any of that,” said the mother, Aneya Farrell, 34. “She hasn’t seen a lot of babies over the past six months.” As the city faces its first notable increase in coronavirus infections since a springtime surge killed more than 20,000, residents are again looking at their neighborhoods and wondering, after each rise in numbers, each passing siren: Is this a second wave? The recent increase prompted Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to order lockdowns in several parts of Brooklyn and Queens where the infection rate has risen most sharply. The restrictions mostly affected neighborhoods with large Orthodox Jewish populations. But other neighborhoods faced partial lockdowns, including the canceling of indoor dining. “It’s scary and upsetting,” Ms. Farrell said, “because we had such a good streak going.” The increases have rattled many people in those neighborhoods and beyond, reminding them of the dark days of March and April when it was impossible to meet friends, eat out at a restaurant, go to church or visit parents. Some New Yorkers see the rise in cases as a harbinger, the footfalls that announce an intruder’s arrival. “I feel like the second wave is here — that same kind of doomsday feeling,” said Anya Ferring, 40, a fashion production consultant who lives in Far Rockaway, Queens, one of the neighborhoods experiencing a partial lockdown. During the pandemic, Ms. Ferring has mostly maintained masked social distancing around her friends, with the masks gradually coming off in the summer. But recently, several of her friends have tested positive for the virus or have had to quarantine. On a recent Saturday, she sat in Herbert Von King Park in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, with a friend, Kelly McKay, 39. Both wore masks. “Summer is over, and the fun is over,” Ms. McKay said. In several interviews in the past several weeks, city residents shared deep frustrations with their fellow New Yorkers who don’t appear to be following the same rules. The solidarity forged in the springtime outbreak appears, in some neighborhoods, to have fractured in the fall. Michael Mitchell, a 49-year-old therapist from Washington Heights, said he was dismayed by what he saw on a recent subway ride. “People were not wearing masks — I asked them to put them on, and they wouldn’t,” he said. “So I feel like that sense of community living that we had is broken.” Andre Williams, 45, the father who has resumed stockpiling acetaminophen and other supplies for his family in Clinton Hill, put it bluntly: “A lot of us took our eyes off the ball.” Jennifer Burchette, a 29-year-old publicist from Bedford-Stuyvesant who changed her plans to return to her office, said too many people are acting as if the threat has passed. “It’s not over because you’re over it,” she said. In a survey of 1,000 New York City residents conducted in late September, 72 percent of the respondents said they expected a second wave of cases that will resemble the surge of April, according to the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, which released the findings on Wednesday. But beneath that fear were signs of optimism. Seventy percent of the respondents said they planned to stay in the city for the duration of its recovery. And the number of people who reported feeling anxious or depressed more than half the time in the past two weeks dropped to 18 and 19 percent, respectively. In a survey in June, 28 percent reported anxiety and 21 percent reported depression. “In the face of this pandemic, it is encouraging that so many people continue to maintain their hope, a great sign of our resilience as New Yorkers,” said Ayman El-Mohandes, the dean of the school. The recent increase in infections has led some of those New Yorkers who are staying put to make fast decisions in the face of a potential lockdown. Foremost for many were choices that involved schools. The parents of more than half of the system’s 1.1 million students have opted to keep them home at least through November. Others leaned hard the opposite way. Robert James, a single father of two children, said he planned to keep his 7-year-old son in school as long as possible. “I didn’t want my kid to have a full year out,” he said. “I thought if I didn’t put him in now, I might not get the chance, especially with a mayor with an itchy trigger to pull them out.” He added, “It’s as safe as it’s going to be right now.” If the positivity rate rises to 3 percent and the city closes the schools again, “the kid stays home,” he said. (The current seven-day citywide rate is 1.7 percent.)
