Scott If the vanity of writers is originality, the vice of critics is classification. Novelists and poets show off their bright plumage and emit their unique trills and warbles while scholars and journalists peer through the foliage, identifying the specimens and sorting them into categories. Look: a regional realist! A flock of autofictionists! Was that a postmodernist? I’ve never seen one in the wild. If I have birds (and bird metaphors) on the brain it’s because I’ve spent much of the past few months reading and rereading Joy Williams, whose books (four novels and five volumes of stories since 1973) abound with avian life. As I tracked the mutilated pelicans and the wounded heron from “Breaking and Entering,” the “pet peahen named Atilla” in “The Quick and the Dead,” the old woman whose body appears grotesquely birdlike to the heroine of “The Changeling,” and the artificial and natural flamingos that pop up everywhere, I wondered if Williams, now 76 and a practiced observer of wildlife in her own right, might be the rarest of literary birds — one who defies guidebook taxonomies altogether. It’s easy enough to say that, but Williams’s individuality isn’t just a matter of idiosyncrasy, of plots and characters willfully torqued away from the ordinary. What she practices is more like camouflage, except that instead of adapting to its environment, Williams’s imagination, by remaining true to itself, reveals new colorations in the ecology around her. You can place her books on a shelf alongside, say, Raymond Carver or Karen Russell, Lauren Groff or Harry Crews, Kate Chopin or Nathaniel Hawthorne, and your ideas about them will change as tendrils of affinity snake from Williams’s pages into theirs. This isn’t influence or coincidence, though Williams shares geographical, generational and genre markings with those and many other writers. Russell wrote the introduction to a recent edition of Williams’s 1978 novel “The Changeling” (grouping its author alongside “Ovid, Shakespeare, Morrison, God”), and you could make a case that they are, with Crews and Groff, leading exponents of the kind of contemporary literary Floridiana that focuses on the sometimes comic, sometimes grotesque, sometimes sad doings of wayward white people in the Sunshine State. Florida comes up a lot in Williams’s work (she has written a nonfiction book about Key West). It’s a landscape of vacation homes and cut-rate amusements with a complicated gravity that expels some characters, attracts others and causes still others to sink into fragrant, hazy torpor. But she’s equally at home in — she has in fact lived in — Arizona and Maine. She’s not really a Western or a New England writer, though. Or maybe she is, insofar as the flat, dry heat of the desert affects the restless young women in “The Quick and the Dead” as much as the humidity of Florida afflicts the listless young women in “State of Grace” and “Breaking and Entering,” and the deep, lonesome dark of a Maine winter shadows the mother-and-child odyssey in the short story “Escapes.” Her sense of place is acute, but her places aren’t steeped in history or tradition. People pass through or stop in them without always understanding or caring where they are. “It was one of those rugged American places,” a minor character in “The Quick and the Dead” muses, recalling his hometown in Washington State, “a remote, sad-ass, but plucky downwind town whose citizens were flawed and brave. He would never go back there, of course.” What kind of writer is Joy Williams? If you put that question to me under torture — you might! I don’t know — I would probably blurt out “a Vintage Contemporaries author.” That’s the imprint that has published most of her books, and while I know that a corporate brand isn’t necessarily a meaningful literary identity, I want to insist that, for some of us whose tastes and sensibilities were formed in the 1980s, this particular brand kind of is. In the decades since, Vintage Contemporaries paperbacks issued between, say, 1984 and 1994 — with their super-glossy covers and bright white spines, their Philip Johnsonesque colophon, the too-bright color illustrations that at once give away everything inside the book and miss the point entirely — have become collectors’ items and fetish objects. They are ugly and beautiful and distinctive in a way that can only start to convey, to those who weren’t around, how weird it was to be alive back then. The covers sometimes more than the contents, since the collection was notably eclectic, inclusive rather than programmatic in its choices. It’s preposterous to suggest that “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,”“Bright Lights, Big City,” “From Rockaway” and “Clea and Zeus Divorce” — eye-catching flagships in the vintage Vintage fleet as I remember it — were all examples of the same thing. But they could nonetheless feel that way to an obsessive young reader in the days before recommendation algorithms. And for this obsessive young reader, the author who most consistently embodied whatever that thing might have been was absolutely Joy Williams. Her covers could be provocative and enigmatic, like the Modiglianiesque woman caressing her own armpit as she reclined above a blurb from Harold Brodkey for “State of Grace,” or the woman (was it the same one?) seen from the back as she hugged herself next to a virtually identical Brodkey quote for “Escapes.” (“To put it simply,” said Brodkey, who was famous for not putting anything simply, “Joy Williams is the most gifted writer of her generation.”) But for me the epitome of Williams, Vintage contemporaneity and everything I didn’t understand about Reagan-era America was “Breaking and Entering,” her 1988 novel about a young Florida couple who squat in other people’s houses and bump up against other human flotsam. That cover is almost absurdly literal: A woman in a blue bikini peeks through brass-handled French doors. In their panes you see reflections of a beach, a palm tree and a pelican in flight. A dog crouches in front of the woman. These are Liberty and Clem, “a big white Alsatian with pale eyes,” and their inscrutable gazes — wary? teasing? hostile? bereft? — hint at the novel’s shifting, enigmatic emotional weather. That bluntly figurative illustration — it reads as a highly specific picture, stylized and slightly fantastical but in no way abstract — implies a tone and a subject matter associated with other well-known writers of the time, who rendered fragments of American life with deadpan diction and hard empirical detail. It was called minimalism or (after a special issue of the literary magazine Granta) dirty realism, rubrics that have long faded from critical discourse. Those old labels can be suggestive, though, in the way that old paperbacks are. And Liberty and her husband, Willie, display some kinship with the unmoored, numbed characters who amble through the pages of Ann Beattie and Raymond Carver. This is partly a matter of the absences that define the minimalized fictional terrain of the 1970s and ’80s. There is a general air of discontent, of alienation, but this feeling doesn’t have a social cause or a political effect. It’s just the way people are. There are richer and poorer people — fancy villas and ratty apartments, childhoods of pampered leisure and first-class schooling as well as back stories of deprivation and precarity — but class is more often a source of atmospheric detail than an explanatory principle. Economics is tangential to eros and subsumed by ecology: Six dwellings. Nine. The swimming pools were lit. The sprinklers cast their slow, soft arcs. Thousands of dollars of lighting and millions of kilowatts of electricity were used to make green plants red and blue. Thousands of gallons of water from the sulfurous, shrinking aquifer were pumped up to make thousands of bags of cypress shreddings dark against the pale trunks of palms. Inside, on a white bamboo table, were a dish of peanuts, two empty martini glasses and a ceramic dildo. It may be that explanation as such — the assumption that things in fiction happen for a reason, and that the writer’s job is to supply or at least imply that reason — is the most important absence in the Williams cosmos. Her characters, the women in particular, often occupy psychological states and exhibit behavioral patterns that might elicit a diagnosis of some kind. But it wouldn’t just be reductive to say that Liberty suffers from depression, or that Pearl and the other heavy drinkers struggle with addiction or that the countless orphans, widows and parents of lost children — nearly everybody in “The Quick and the Dead” and half of the population of the stories in the omnibus collection “The Visiting Privilege” — are processing their grief. Phrases like those are clichés, examples of the kind of banal, flattened language Williams avoids the way her characters avoid permanence — temperamentally and also programmatically. A lazy, secondhand phrase will sometimes turn up in quotation marks, but always flagged as a moral error, a sign of bad faith or bad taste, a category mistake.
