Kirby has listened to a determined refrain from fellow Kenosha residents who have endured the tumult of the past two weeks. We need to rebuild our burned businesses, they tell him. We need to get back to normal. That’s where he interjects. “Let’s not get back to anything,” he said. Kenosha erupted in outrage and division over days of tragedy, violence and destruction. Since Aug. 23, the city has been the scene of a police shooting that left a Black man, Jacob Blake,  paralyzed; emotional demonstrations and several nights of looting and fires; and the killing of two protesters in the street. Last week  it became a hotly contested presidential battleground, as President Trump visited, followed by Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic candidate. As a nightly curfew in Kenosha has been lifted and protests have quieted, the question of what comes next for this city has revealed an even wider chasm between residents. Should it follow the leads of Ferguson, Mo., and Minneapolis after their own periods of unrest, as some in Kenosha have argued, and consider diversifying its slate of mostly white elected officials, re-examine longstanding policies and pass measures aimed at reforming policing? Or should residents view the last two weeks as an awful aberration, events that some residents described as rioting largely by outside agitators? “We haven’t had a huge event like this, something where we’ve really had to have a conversation about race,” said Tim Thompkins, a former affirmative action officer for the city of Kenosha. “That’s why we’re going to have such difficulty.” The death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May sparked a handful of protests in downtown Kenosha by Black Lives Matter activists throughout the summer. But the city itself has not faced a real racial reckoning until now. That may be in part because it is a small, mostly white community. Of its 100,000 residents, 11 percent are Black, a proportion that has increased only slightly in the past 30 years. Kenosha’s struggles for the last generation have been focused on rebuilding a faltering economy after car manufacturing mostly disappeared in the late 1980s, erasing 10 percent of the city’s work force. And while most people in the city lean Democratic, voting for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump in 2016 by 17 percentage points, there is a streak of social conservatism reflected in the “Back the Blue” yard signs all over town, and a tendency to explain individual incidents as the errors of particular police officers rather than as systemic problems with policing. “Is there a bad apple in every profession? Yes, there is,” said Rocco LaMacchia, a six-term city alderman and the chairman of the committee that oversees public safety. “But you don’t defund the police department because of one person. That’s not happening in Kenosha. As long as I’m alive and an alderman, it’s not going to happen.” Mr. LaMacchia favors one change to city policing: He has suggested moving up the purchase of body-worn cameras for police to 2021 from 2022, the original plan. Anthony Kennedy, an alderman who represents the heavily Black district where Mr. Blake was shot, argues that deeper, more fundamental change is needed. “For people who say this town is fine and it’s just one bad apple, you have to understand that your view is not monolithic for the city of Kenosha,” Mr. Kennedy said. “And you have to understand that there are people in this city who are living a distinctly different experience.” Activists have called for the police officer who shot Mr. Blake to be fired; the officer is currently on administrative leave. They also want swift changes to the leadership of the police department and the county sheriff’s department, whose top officials are both white.
