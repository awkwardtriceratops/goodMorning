By Remy Tumin and Karen Cetinkaya (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. New coronavirus cases are trending upward in 39 states, pushing the U.S. curve to its highest level since August. Those states include much of the Northeast, which is starting to backslide after months of progress, the Midwest and the Mountain West, where outbreaks have strained hospitals. North Dakota and South Dakota are reporting more new cases per capita than any other states to date. Above, Oceanside, Calif. The first lady, Melania Trump, revealed some of her own suffering with the virus, and disclosed that her son, Barron Trump, had also been infected. On the other side of the Atlantic, Spain, France and the U.K. have all added more cases per capita than the U.S. over the seven days that ended on Tuesday, according to a Times database. France said it would impose a curfew in the Paris region and in eight other major cities. Separately, experts are comforted that three major Covid-19 trials were recently paused for safety considerations. And yes, you can be reinfected, but it’s extremely unlikely. 2. The future of the Affordable Care Act took center stage in the final day of questioning in Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Judge Barrett told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had no “animus” toward the law or “agenda” to strike it down, despite President Trump’s stated desire that she do so when the court hears a challenge next month. Our Supreme Court correspondent writes that the judge’s technical description appeared at points to argue in favor of leaving the A.C.A. intact. Republicans began to openly laud the ascension of a conservative, religious judge. Senator Lindsey Graham praised her as “a woman who is unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology.” 3. An estimated 5.2 million Americans cannot vote in the 2020 election because they have been convicted of felonies, according to a report by the Sentencing Project. The U.S. is an outlier in permitting the denial of voting rights to people who are former felons, a practice that most likely depresses turnout for Democrats. Above, Desmond Meade, executive director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, in Orlando last month. Other election developments: President Trump and Senator Thom Tillis are trailing Democrats in North Carolina, a critical state for the G.O.P., a Times/Siena poll found. Mr. Trump and Joe Biden couldn’t be farther apart on how to deal with climate change. Here’s a guide to major climate questions in the election. Have you filled out your census questionnaire yet? The Supreme Court’s decision on Tuesday to end the count early means that you have until 6 a.m. Eastern on Friday to fill out the form online. Paper responses must be postmarked by Thursday. 4. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he did not expect an economic relief package to be enacted before the Nov. 3 election. Stocks fell. Mr. Mnuchin and Speaker Nancy Pelosi held discussions over coronavirus relief today and agreed to speak again on Thursday, even though Democrats and Republicans remain wildly divided over the scope and size of another stimulus bill. Millions of Americans are still out of work, hundreds of thousands of small businesses are closing for good, and the country’s largest banks are prepared for a wave of loan defaults they expect in the second half of next year. But thanks to revenues from investors’ volatile trading, the banks themselves are doing just fine. 5. The white woman who called 911 on a Black man bird-watching in Central Park in May made a second call falsely claiming he tried to assault her, prosecutors said.
