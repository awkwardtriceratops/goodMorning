Then Came the Dragon Fruit.<br></h1><p id="artcont">In an area devastated by droughts and erratic rainfall, I took a chance on a bright little magenta ball of hope. By Alexander Villegas Mr. Villegas is a journalist and farmer. LIBERIA, Costa Rica — I hated the family farm as a kid. It was hot; it reeked of manure; and it’s where a tree crushed and killed my grandfather. When we visited, I spent my time playing with my Game Boy while the other kids took turns riding young bulls. So I was surprised when my dad asked me to take the farm over last year. He’d recently retired and was planning on selling part of it to pay off his house in the city. He’d live off the rest and drive up to the farm throughout the week. But the lawyer he hired stole the land. My dad lost his house and was afraid he’d lose everything else. I agreed to Dad’s request, but had no idea what to do. I’m a journalist and was spending nearly every waking hour in front of a computer running a small newspaper in the capital, San José. The farm was a few hours north, in Guanacaste, a province known for beautiful beaches and cattle farms. It’s also known for its increasingly severe droughts.
