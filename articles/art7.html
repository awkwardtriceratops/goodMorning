But after she watched George Floyd’s death in a video on her phone, Daria Allen’s world drastically changed. By Kate Conger PORTLAND, Ore. — Last summer, it seemed like everyone in Portland was turning 15. Daria Allen’s neighborhood buzzed with a steady hum of quinceañeras and parties. She joined a dance team, and signed up for extra dance classes at a local studio. As she turned 16 over the fall, she was ready to get her driver’s license, but that brought on a nagging new worry: What if she were out driving and got stopped by the police? This year’s deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, both African-Americans who were killed by the police, turned it into a constant loop of anxiety: What if the police came to her home and shot her grandmother? What if she had children and then saw one die in a traffic stop? So Ms. Allen’s summer is different this year. She has not had time for dance classes. She is instead one of the many protesters who have rallied nightly in downtown Portland, mounting one of the longest-running cries for racial justice since Mr. Floyd’s death on May 25. Next week, she will start her junior year of high school. The main thing she is worried about is how her class schedule will conflict with protests. “For me, being a young Black woman, I’m just focused on my life. That’s really why I’m out here,” she said. “I am just a Black girl trying to live.” Ms. Allen grew up in the Pacific Northwest and recently moved to her grandmother’s home on the north side of Portland, where she could have her own bedroom and the privacy from her mother and siblings that she craved. She had been one of only a few Black students at her elementary and middle schools, but her high school was more diverse — she no longer felt like she stuck out. It was in late May that she was scrolling through Instagram and saw a video of Mr. Floyd lying in the street, a white police officer’s knee digging into his neck. She watched it again. “I just remember crying,” Ms. Allen said. “Especially when he called out for his mom, that made me so sad.”
