We’re wasting it. By Devi Sridhar Dr. Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh. EDINBURGH, Scotland — This spring, when Western Europe became an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, countries imposed strict lockdowns: In France, a person needed a permit to go shopping; Spain required children to stay indoors the entire day; in Scotland and Wales, people could go outside for a walk only once a day and had to stay within a five-mile radius. Thanks to this, European countries were able to not only flatten the Covid-19 curve but to also keep levels of infection very low. But as the weeks went by, the pressure to reopen society grew. People wanted their prepandemic lives back. They wanted dynamic economies to protect their jobs; they wanted their children educated in schools; they wanted nights out at the pub and visits to their friends. And they really wanted summer vacations. Tourism and travel, it turns out, is one of Europe’s particular problems. Tourism accounts for some 600 billion euros (more than $700 billion) of the European Union’s gross domestic product. It provides nearly 12 million people with employment directly and another 15 million people with indirect employment. And the summer holiday is a veritable European institution, made only more central to many people’s lives by the advent of low-cost air travel. So this summer, with the virus tamped down to what many governments considered “acceptable” levels — the U.K. Joint Biosecurity Center, for example, has suggested that an acceptable incidence for Britain is 1,000 symptomatic new cases per day — countries started to reopen and people began to travel. Britons and Germans wanted to escape to the beaches; Spaniards and Greeks wanted to see their tourism economies kept alive. But, predictably, cases are starting to increase. Spain now has about 3,500 new coronavirus cases per day, up from fewer than 700 at the end of May. Germany saw 1,445 new infections one day this week, the highest number of daily infections in more than three months. This should be a cause for serious concern. The recent experiences of Israel and the state of Victoria in Australia show that even a handful of daily new cases can easily become hundreds and thousands. The rise in infections in Europe seems particularly linked to activities like barhopping, clubbing and partying among younger people, as well as the rush to welcome international visitors and reopen tourism and its related activities. A “super-spreading event” at a club in the Spanish city of Córdoba resulted in 91 people testing positive.
