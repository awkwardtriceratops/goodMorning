But when the pandemic hit, the A-listers hid while Gen Z’s rising stars stayed in plain sight. By Taylor Lorenz Fletcher Greene, 38, has an encyclopedic knowledge of the internet’s dramas and daily displays. He can tell you which influencers are feuding, who hosted a socially undistanced party last weekend, and where the Sway Boys ate lunch on Tuesday. This wasn’t always the case. But in recent months, as paparazzi in Los Angeles have worked tirelessly to track down the few masked A-listers in town, Mr. Greene has turned his focus to subjects in plain sight: the social media stars of Gen Z. His brand, the Hollywood Fix, has become an essential source for on-the-ground coverage of their daily outings in pandemic-era Los Angeles. While drama channels and tea accounts like @TikTokRoom share screenshots and recordings of influencers’ online behavior, the Hollywood Fix captures their offline lives. Mr. Greene’s videos have become so ubiquitous on the teen internet that they’re now a meme. Hundreds of young people on TikTok have posted Hollywood Fix parody videos, and YouTubers like Emma Chamberlain have referenced the Hollywood Fix in their videos. People often parrot Mr. Greene’s signature catch phrase — “The fans wanna know!” — in videos and replies on Twitter. “Whenever I have nothing to do, I’ll watch the Hollywood Fix,” said Alana Lintao, 16, a TikToker in New Jersey who creates parodies of Mr. Greene’s videos. In January, she spent hours consuming content on his YouTube channel. “I kind of got caught in a loop and I was binge watching all of the videos,” she said. Becoming a celebrity documentarian — not to mention an authority on Gen Z — wasn’t Mr. Greene’s plan when he moved from Dallas to Los Angeles in 2013. He had come to the city for a change of pace. At the time he was working as a music producer. Soon after his arrival, he noticed the number of famous people walking around his West Hollywood neighborhood. “I used to live down the street from Karrueche Tran, and I’d see Chris Brown,” he said. One day, he began snapping pictures of the two with his phone. He called up TMZ to see if someone there would be interested in buying them, and to his surprise an editor offered him $1,000 in exchange for a few photos.
