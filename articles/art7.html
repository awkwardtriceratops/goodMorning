Also: An uproar over fake “official” ballot boxes distributed by Republicans. By Jill Cowan Good morning. On Sunday evening near my apartment, cheers erupted from the sports bar showing the game on its patio. Fireworks exploded across the city, and in Downtown Los Angeles, crowds got rowdy. The Los Angeles Lakers had done something the team has done 16 times before: won the N.B.A. championship. Of course, it’s October. The memory of one of the last times fans spontaneously gathered outside Staples Center — to mourn the shocking death of Kobe Bryant — loomed large. And the Lakers’ victory over the Miami Heat capped a surreal, momentous season defined by the pandemic and by protest against racism and police brutality. [See a timeline of the year that changed basketball.] My colleague Marc Stein wrote more about what it all means for basketball, the Lakers and LeBron James: Amassing the best regular-season record in the Western Conference could not help the Los Angeles Lakers in the N.B.A. bubble. With games played at a neutral site at Walt Disney World — and without fans — holding the West’s No. 1 seed in the playoffs was mostly ceremonial. The Lakers lived up to billing anyway, turning to the devastating duo of LeBron James and Anthony Davis to override the loss of home-court advantage. James capped the longest and most turbulent season in N.B.A. history — one of great sorrow for his Lakers in the wake of Kobe Bryant’s tragic death in January — by averaging a near triple-double in the N.B.A. finals against the Miami Heat and restoring the Lakers to championship status. In just his second season in Los Angeles, James has his own enduring slice of purple-and-gold history now. He arrived in July 2018 after the worst five seasons in club history and, at the first attempt since forming a classic superstar tag team with Davis in July 2019, enabled the Lakers to match the Boston Celtics, their longtime rivals, for the league lead in championships with 17. This is the Lakers’ first title with Jeanie Buss, the daughter of the team’s longtime owner Jerry Buss, in charge. Rob Pelinka, the Lakers’ general manager, served as the longtime agent for his close friend Bryant, who was killed in a helicopter crash, alongside his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others, on Jan. 26. Buss and Pelinka were widely criticized before completing a trade with New Orleans to acquire Davis, in part because the trade took months to materialize and because the coach they hired, Frank Vogel, was their third choice. Yet it was difficult, even amid all those personal breakthroughs and redemption stories like the veteran center Dwight Howard, not to focus on James and what a fourth championship does for his legacy. James did not win the N.B.A.’s regular-season Most Valuable Player Award and may never do enough, for some, to nudge Michael Jordan off his perch in the sport’s eternally heated greatest-of-all-time debate. But winning a finals M.V.P. trophy in a third different uniform puts James in his own stratosphere. When he turns 36 in December, James will do so with the satisfaction of lording over the N.B.A. once again. And with the acceptance of the Lakers’ ever-demanding fans, too. Read more: Although Gov.
