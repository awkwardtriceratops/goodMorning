Lukashenko’s security forces appear to have shifted from mass repression to more targeted disappearances. By Andrew Higgins MOSCOW — Maria Kolesnikova, the last prominent protest leader in Belarus still at large, vanished on Monday and local news media outlets reported that she had been grabbed off the street by masked kidnappers in the center of the East European nation’s capital, bundled into a dark minivan and driven away at speed. The abduction of Ms. Kolesnikova, the latest in a series of disappearances apparently engineered by Belarus’s security agencies, followed large protests on Sunday in Minsk, the capital, and towns across the country. It seemed to reflect a shift in strategy from the initial frenzy of police violence against protesters to picking off opposition leaders one by one and sending them out of the country. Linas Linkevicius, the foreign minister of neighboring Lithuania, said Ms. Kolesnikova had been the victim of a “kidnapping,” deploring in a Twitter post that “Stalinist N.K.V.D. methods are being applied in 21st century Europe.” The N.K.V.D. was the precursor of the K.G.B., a name still proudly embraced by the main security agency in Belarus, a former Soviet republic that has often been described as “Europe’s last dictatorship.” At a news conference on Monday in Warsaw, the capital of neighboring Poland, exiled members of a coordination council set up last month in Minsk by opponents of President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko said that Ms. Kolesnikova, a member of the council’s presidium, had disappeared without a trace off the street in Minsk in the morning. Olga Kovalkova, a member of the council who was herself arrested two weeks ago in Minsk and then forced to leave Belarus for Poland over the weekend, said that Ms Kolesnikova had been “kidnapped in central Minsk” by “unknown people.”
