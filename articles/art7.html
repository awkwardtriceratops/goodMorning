By Richard McGregor Mr. McGregor is the author of “The Party: The Secret World of China’s Communist Rulers.” SYDNEY, Australia — President Xi Jinping has accumulated legions of powerful critics in China since he took office in early 2013. There are the once-powerful officials who have been felled by his sweeping anti-corruption campaign. There are the economists who resist his statist instincts. There are the academics who have objected to his authoritarian measures, such as his decision to abolish presidential term limits. Yet the latest meeting of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, held in late October, suggests that Mr. Xi is stronger than ever. Unlike any Chinese leader since the C.C.P. took power in 1949, he has no identifiable rivals and no likely successors. Some of Mr. Xi’s detractors have fallen silent; others have come on board with his program, reluctantly or after taking an intellectual leap. Those who dared to keep criticizing him have been punished. Mr. Xi’s ascendancy is remarkable on many counts, especially considering that at the beginning of the year the new coronavirus took hold in Wuhan, then quickly spread elsewhere in China and to the rest of the world. The outbreak would become “China’s Chernobyl,” some headlines and U.S. politicians screamed at the time, a societal and political meltdown that would expose the regime’s structural bankruptcy and fatally undermine Mr. Xi’s standing with both the party and the people. Ten months later, Mr. Xi seems to be getting his way on nearly all fronts. The C.C.P. recently held its semiregular plenum of the Central Committee, the 370-odd-member body that formally approves major decisions, such as the country’s five-year economic plans or the choice of top leaders. In years past, observers of the gathering would typically try to unearth the hidden meaning of top-level personnel moves or any signs of shifting power dynamics between long-jostling factions, such as the China Youth League or the so-called Shanghai Gang. The pundits never had much hard evidence to go on. Communist habits die hard: Delegates are locked in at the gathering’s venue for several days, and all media are excluded from the event. But for years, there were at least visible signs of jockeying and horse trading among political clans with links to past leaders and others with revolutionary pedigrees. This year, though, no one has even bothered to do much of a Youth League vs. Shanghai Gang head count. The longer Mr. Xi stays in office, the less the old factions and clans matter. His predecessor, Hu Jintao (a former leader of the Youth League), has barely been seen outside of ceremonial occasions since he handed all of his positions to Mr. Xi in late 2012. Mr. Hu’s predecessor, Jiang Zemin (the titular head of the Shanghai Gang), who maintained influence over senior appointments and the military during Mr. Hu’s tenure, is now an ailing 94, and he and his acolytes have been kept in their place by the threat of anti-corruption investigations, should any of them be tempted to push back. And now, too, Mr. Xi’s strength has only been reinforced by the coronavirus pandemic. After early cover-ups of the outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese government deployed the authoritarian tools at its disposal very effectively. Unencumbered by the messy discussions that have bogged down some democracies, China promptly closed provincial borders, stopped domestic travel, shut down businesses and confined millions of citizens to their homes — measures that were implemented firmly thanks partly to the state’s surveillance capacity. A crisis that risked looking like a systemic meltdown was soon recast as a battle of national will and patriotism — of the rally-around-the-party, more than rally-around-the-flag, kind. Ren Zhiqiang, the real-estate tycoon known as “Big Cannon” Ren, called Mr. Xi a “clown” during the early, difficult stages of the coronavirus outbreak. In the past, Mr. Ren’s excellent connections in the party had afforded him protection for his outspokenness. Not this time. He was investigated for corruption, expelled from the C.C.P. and in September sentenced to 18 years in prison. By then, Mr. Xi and the party were enjoying a major propaganda windfall. The population could readily see how the coronavirus had largely stopped spreading in China, whereas a mess was unfolding, again, in the United States and many European democracies, as new outbreaks were about to force some of those countries back into lockdown. China’s economy grew by 4.9 percent in the third quarter of 2020, and some economists project that it may soon return to pre-pandemic growth rates. The intensifying confrontation between China and the Trump administration has only played into this narrative, allowing Mr. Xi to portray various policies as necessary measures in an existential struggle against an implacable enemy dead-set on destroying China. China’s state media were effusive at the close of the recent plenum, lauding the country’s leaders for “injecting certainty into a turbulent world.” The official communiqué released after the meeting stated that China must “comprehensively strengthen training and preparedness” in the military — a notable injunction since post-plenum statements rarely mention war readiness. Mr. Xi is also doubling down on efforts to make China self-reliant in key technologies. In a speech published recently in the party magazine Qiushi, Mr. Xi called on China to forge “killer technologies” and protect itself against possible disruptions of foreign supplies.
