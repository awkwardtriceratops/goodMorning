By Remy Tumin and Jeremiah M. Bogert, Jr. (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The U.S. passed nine million coronavirus cases, with no end in sight to the surge. Twenty-one states added more cases in the seven-day period ending Wednesday than in any other seven-day stretch of the pandemic. In total, the U.S. has identified more cases than any other country and has one of the world’s highest per capita infection rates. Above, a hospital in El Paso. “We have pandemic fatigue, everybody’s sick of this, right?” said an epidemiologist in Texas. “But you know what, the virus doesn’t care.” Over the past week, a string of prominent public health experts — notably Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease specialist, and Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former F.D.A. commissioner under President Trump — have said it is time to seriously consider a national mask mandate. One bright spot: Survival rates have improved with medical advances and less crowded hospitals, studies say. 2. U.S. economic output increased at the fastest pace on record last quarter — with major caveats. Gross domestic product grew 7.4 percent in the third quarter, a 33.1 percent annual rate and the biggest gain ever, fueled in part by trillions of dollars in federal assistance to households and businesses. But the economy in the quarter was also 3.5 percent smaller than at the end of 2019, before the pandemic, meaning economic output is about two-thirds of the way back to where it was. Think of it this way, our Upshot reporter writes: The American economy was hit by a bus. It’s healing, but slowly. Stocks on Wall Street rallied, led by gains in big technology companies in a rebound from their worst decline in more than four months. 3. In the waning days of the campaign, the president has hailed the economy’s growth spurt as evidence that it has roared back to life. He is also making the case — against all evidence — that the country is “rounding the corner” in the pandemic. Mr. Trump’s determination to brush aside the crisis has become the defining choice of his bid for a second term, our politics reporter writes, and represents the core of his message throughout the campaign’s endgame. Joe Biden has sought advice across the Democratic Party’s ideological spectrum, but his core advisers on the virus, economics, foreign policy and climate change are familiar figures. Here’s who has Mr. Biden’s ear. 4. The two candidates converged on Tampa, Fla., just hours apart. Their dueling events underscore just how close their campaigns think the Florida vote could be on Tuesday — and how essential it is to their prospects. With a narrow path to re-election, Mr. Trump cannot afford to lose Florida’s 29 electoral votes. Polls show Mr. Biden with a slight advantage.
