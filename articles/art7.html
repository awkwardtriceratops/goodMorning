But Democrats worry an overreliance on the mail could be damaging to their side too. By Luke Broadwater WASHINGTON — For months, Republican strategists have grimaced as President Trump has railed against mail-in voting as “a scam” rife with “fraud,” worried that his spreading of misinformation would kneecap the party’s traditionally successful efforts in getting many of its supporters to cast ballots by mail. Five weeks before Election Day, their fears have been borne out as Democrats have built a huge lead in requests for absentee ballots in crucial swing states. But now, that same partisan divide has become a concern for Democrats too. As the surge in voting by mail amid the pandemic tests the resources of election officials across the country, widespread problems — including ballots being rejected at high rates, election boards sending them out too late, or the Postal Service failing to deliver them on time — could lead to more Democrats’ votes going uncounted as a result. The worry has prompted some Democratic-aligned political groups to shift away from encouraging mail-in voting and instead promote in-person early-voting centers where available. “I’m concerned with Donald Trump and the Republican Party’s attempt to limit votes,” said Quentin James, the founder and president of The Collective PAC, which is dedicated to electing Black lawmakers. “They’re afraid of the almost 5 million African-Americans who didn’t vote in 2016 coming out and voting.” Mr. James’s group plans to spend $7 million in large cities in battleground states — such as Milwaukee, Detroit, Philadelphia, Charlotte and Atlanta — to encourage in-person voting in Black communities, a strategy he hopes will subject fewer of those voters to the Republican legal challenges that are bound to occur with ballots sent by mail. He is particularly concerned about reports that mail-in ballots from younger Black and Hispanic voters are rejected at higher rates from older white voters. So far, Democrats have opened up a large lead in absentee-ballot requests in most of the key battleground states that release such data. In Florida, where Republicans have long prided themselves on their vote-by-mail prowess, nearly 2.3 million Democrats have requested a mail-in ballot, compared to about 1.6 million Republicans. In Pennsylvania, another hotly contested state, nearly 1.5 million Democrats have requested a mail-in ballot — nearly three times the requests from Republicans. In North Carolina, Democrats are outpacing Republicans 524,000 requests to 195,000, and in Iowa about 319,000 Democrats have requested a mail-in ballot, nearly double the Republican total. The trend has prompted hand-wringing from Republican campaigns large and small. If Republicans bet too heavily on their supporters voting in-person on Election Day, a local coronavirus outbreak or even bad weather could derail their turnout. Party strategists said they were particularly worried about their party’s vote-by-mail performance with seniors, an important voting bloc, who may be especially wary of going to the polls during a pandemic. “One rule of campaigns is to get as many of your voters to vote as early as possible,” said Glen Bolger, a top Republican pollster. “The president basically has sent the message to Republicans not to vote by mail, and the Republicans are listening.” Republican lawmakers and operatives have quietly urged Mr. Trump’s team to change his rhetoric about mail-in voting. The president won Florida in 2016 in part because of the advantage Republicans had in voting by mail. Party leaders including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, have publicly said that voters casting ballots by mail could expect their votes will be counted. “I want Republicans to vote by mail, by absentee. I want them to go to the polls,” Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, said when asked about the partisan divide in mail-in ballot requests. “We’ve got our work cut out for us.” Last week, in a message to his supporters in Florida, Mr. Trump was temporarily in sync with the party’s playbook. “Vote-by-mail ballots in my home state of FLORIDA begin going out TODAY!” he wrote on Twitter. “Make sure to request yours, fill it out & send it in. Request yours today.” But the president has more often denounced voting by mail, calling it a way to rig the election against him and arguing that mail-in ballots are inherently suspect. During his debate on Tuesday with Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, Mr. Trump once again assailed mail-in balloting, citing a handful of ballots in Pennsylvania that were inappropriately discarded to argue that Democrats were using the mail to cheat. Historically, mail-in voting has not bestowed a partisan advantage on either side. But Mr. Trump’s rhetoric have turned the practice itself into a political issue. In polls, many more Democrats than Republicans have said they planned to vote by mail this election. Beyond the presidential race, the divide could also mean trouble for endangered Republican incumbents including Senators Joni Ernst of Iowa and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, and Representative Scott Perry of Pennsylvania.
