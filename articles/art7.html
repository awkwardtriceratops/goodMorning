By David Leonhardt Want to get The Morning by email? Here’s the sign-up. Four years ago, Donald Trump rallied from a summer deficit in the polls to win the presidency. In the wake of this year’s Republican convention and the continuing chaos in some cities, many people — both his supporters and detractors — seem obsessed with the notion that he will do so again. And he may. Trump could certainly win re-election, especially because he would not need to win the national popular vote to do so. But there also seems to be a rush to declare that he has emerged from his convention in a much stronger position than he was before it. As G. Elliott Morris, who writes about polling for The Economist, tweeted over the weekend, “I see that people desperately want a post-RNC bounce news cycle.” As FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver wrote, “There is a lot of ‘the pendulum is swinging away from Biden’ speculation based on rather little actual evidence.” The pioneering psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman came up with an idea decades ago that explains the rush to declare a Trump surge: availability. The idea of availability is that people assess the likelihood of an event occurring based on how easy it is to imagine. And that often leads to errors. Since Trump won a comeback victory in the most recent presidential election, it’s very easy to imagine him doing so again. The possibility is highly available to our brains. In truth, the evidence of a recent Trump bounce is somewhere between mixed and weak. In two polls — by Morning Consult and Yahoo News/YouGov — Joe Biden’s lead over Trump has shrunk modestly (to six percentage points, in both). But an ABC News-Ipsos poll found no change, and a poll by the University of Southern California showed that Biden’s lead had grown slightly. In FiveThirtyEight’s polling average, Biden leads by 8.2 percentage points. I often rely on Nate Cohn — who writes about polling and helps design Times polls — to help make sense of confusing times, and here’s his advice: 1. Trump has a serious chance to win re-election. (Most people seem to be doing a good job of remembering this.) 2. Post-convention polling bounces usually fade. So for a post-convention bounce to be good for Trump, it would probably need to show that he was doing better than trailing Biden by six points. 3. Polling is often messy immediately after the conventions, and you’d be wise to wait until after Labor Day to come to any conclusions about whether the campaign had changed. Last night, Nate tweeted: “I think people sense that the issue environment has changed in a way that *could* benefit Trump: crime/unrest is more salient; COVID less salient. I think that’s plausible. Whether it’s true, consequential, or lasting is all speculation.” Details remained murky about the killing of a man in Portland, Ore., this weekend. The Times has put together a Q. and A. about what we know and don’t know. A pro-Trump, pro-police caravan traveled through the city on Saturday, clashing with counterprotesters at times. People shot paintball guns from trucks in the caravan, and protesters threw objects at them. The man who died, from a gunshot wound to the chest, has not been identified; he was wearing a hat with the insignia of Patriot Prayer, a local far-right group. The responses: “Do you seriously wonder, Mr. President, why this is the first time in decades that America has seen this level of violence?” Portland’s mayor, Ted Wheeler, said on Sunday. “It’s you who have created the hate and the division.” Trump responded on Twitter, calling Wheeler “weak and pathetic.” The president also praised the caravan’s members as “great patriots” and accused the protesters — without any evidence — of trying to stage a “coup attempt.” Biden said Sunday: “I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same.” Rod Rosenstein, the former deputy attorney general, curtailed the F.B.I.’s investigation into President Trump’s personal and financial relationship with Russia, The Times’s Michael Schmidt reports in a forthcoming book. Rosenstein limited the investigation, even though some career officials thought Trump’s Russia ties posed a national security threat. And Rosenstein instructed Robert Mueller, the former special counsel, to conduct an inquiry into election interference, but not into the president’s affinity for Russia. The U.S. fossil fuel industry faces an existential crisis as the planet grows warmer and renewable energy becomes more common. In response, oil companies have spent billions to pivot to producing plastics, which are made from the same chemicals. But who wants all that plastic? Documents obtained by The Times show that the industry is hoping to send much of it to Kenya — and to weaken the country’s environmental laws in the process.

Large-scale protests against President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus, the country’s longtime authoritarian leader, entered their fourth week. “People have gotten tired of everything and stopped being afraid,” one demonstrator said. The U.S. has passed six million confirmed coronavirus cases. (Here’s a map with the latest figures nationwide.) In New York, the absence of widely available rapid virus tests has led affluent New Yorkers to turn to services that can yield results in as little as 24 hours. Free standard tests can take days to return results. The Times’s Rukmini Callimachi has reported the largely untold story of what happened the night police killed Breonna Taylor in a botched drug raid. In his latest media column, The Times’s Ben Smith examines the long shadow of a 1996 magazine story on race by the prominent journalist Andrew Sullivan.
