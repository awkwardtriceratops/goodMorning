By Elisabeth Egan For the first few weeks of “school,” my teenagers had nothing to say about remote learning. They came downstairs for breakfast, then trudged back to their bedrooms for homeroom. My inquiries yielded two responses: “It’s fine,” and “Can you please not talk to the cats in that voice while I’m in school?” I knew this year’s distance education was more rigorous than last spring’s free-for-all, but otherwise I was in the dark until we had another family over for a socially distanced dinner on our porch. As my husband distributed ice-cream sandwiches (unsung heroes of Covid socializing), my friends’ son told us about his virtual carpentry class. The course is being taught by a substitute “until the real teacher gets certified,” and the first lesson started with a slide that said “Welcome to Crapentry.” Suddenly, our porch erupted with competing stories: about students who play video games during class, report to pre-calculus from the line at the Dunkin’ Donuts drive-through, never turn their camera on or don’t show up at all; about parents and pets intruding at inopportune moments; about virtual fire drills, lockdown drills and gym class; and teachers shushing their spouses and children. I’d already seen a screenshot of my daughter’s pregnant teacher with her toddler on her lap — a portrait of the new work-life pileup. The adults tried to sound a positive note (“Everyone is doing their best!”), but our voices were drowned out by the joyous frenzy of four teenagers competing to shock their audience. I was glad I’d warned my neighbors that we were expecting a raucous crowd. (Transparency and selective hearing are pillars of porch etiquette, as they are in the raising of adolescents.) My husband and I have three kids in three different schools. Our suburban New Jersey district is fully remote for now, so our eighth grader and 11th grader spend roughly six hours a day watching synchronous classes on laptops. They wander, bleary-eyed, into the kitchen at odd times — for lunch at 10:10 a.m. or for a three-minute break between periods. When they’re not in school they’re eating Cheez-Its, staring at phones propped up against the fruit bowl. My son has a permanent bend in his hair from noise-canceling headphones. Occasionally, from my improvised office, I hear one of my kids answering or asking a question, but mostly what I hear is unnerving silence. There is no leave-taking or homecoming, no rhythmic pulse of routine, just the soft throb of a household perpetually in limbo. My son and younger daughter are here but not here; being taught but not necessarily learning, seeing people but not actually interacting with humanity. And they’re the lucky ones — with desks, Wi-Fi and a fridge stocked with food. They know this, and my husband and I know how lucky we are that they can work independently. Our older daughter is a sophomore at a small New England college, where she takes three out of four classes from her dorm room and eats most meals outside. She was an orientation leader on Zoom. She mentors seniors at a local high school and volunteers for a congresswoman on Zoom. She goes to professors’ office hours on Zoom. She wasn’t allowed to leave campus for the first six weeks she was at school. Her school has tried to help students feel less isolated — they’ve hosted food trucks, outdoor movie nights, puppies on the quad — but the fact remains: Residential and academic life are fundamentally altered for the near future. Last week my daughter had a dental emergency and the local doctor who agreed to see her said, “I can’t believe this is your college experience.” When she repeated this to me on the phone, she started to cry. I cried too, silently, as I walked our dog past the corner where she used to wait for the bus to middle school. I know how hard my daughter worked to get to this college; I remember how proud she was as she gave us a tour during our first parents weekend. The programming for this year’s Fall Family Weekend was online, including live virtual stargazing and a slide show featuring masked students studying in the library at opposite ends of a table. Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad that my kids’ schools have decided to err on the side of caution, science and the public good. I don’t want them inside crowded, unventilated buildings right now. I’m grateful for the informative, optimistic missives I receive from hard-working principals and deans. I wouldn’t want to be the person organizing textbook distribution and virtual back-to-school night any more than I would want to be Dr. Fauci. But when I wake up in the middle of the night, I wonder: Is this really the best we can offer our children? A year ago they were forming genuine relationships with teachers, tossing an arm around a friend’s shoulder. Now they’re isolated and glued to screens. Imagine yourself at 13, completing a group project by video chat with kids you don’t know; at 16, learning physics alone in your bedroom; at 19, muting yourself in class. I understand why remote school is necessary. We all have to do our part, but I don’t want to get too comfortable with what I think of as the “new silence.” It’s not sustainable or healthy, especially for teenagers whose curriculum should include independence and freedom alongside physics and Spanish. At my elementary school, there was a substitute teacher who made kids sit in the trash can when they misbehaved. I landed there once, and it was exciting at first. The putty-colored bin offered a change of scenery, a break from my usual role as a diligent student. But when my classmates’ attention drifted back to decimals, I started to panic. I knew I didn’t belong in the trash; I knew I was just being stashed there while the teacher regained control of the classroom. Right now, our children and young adults know they aren’t where they’re supposed to be. They’re going along with the joke while well aware that the people in charge — really in charge — are out to lunch. And I’m not talking about teachers, like the one who hung a Malala poster in her kitchen to make it look like a classroom; or my friend who teaches 37 kindergartners on Zoom; or the language arts teacher who had her baby earlier than expected and is now teaching “The House on Mango Street” with her camera turned off until the district locates a sub. For 15 years, I’ve marked days and seasons by the rhythms of the elementary school across the street from our house. When the Chartwells food delivery truck pulls into the parking lot, I know my alarm is about to start beeping. When handprint turkeys appear in the windows, it’s time to call dibs on the easiest dish for our Thanksgiving feast (corn casserole). Now the parking lot is empty and the windows are dark. I miss the sounds of little kids and bells. I also miss looking out my bedroom window and watching my kids leave for the day: younger daughter first, her posture telegraphing busyness and poise; then my son, loping in the opposite direction of school so he can meet up with a friend and walk together. I miss their backpacks, their lunch bags and the jumble of gym clothes and binders in the front hallway. I’ll never take these things for granted again — the hustle of young people going places, the drone of the Pledge of Allegiance drifting on a breeze, my front row seat on the beautiful mess of normalcy. I’ve learned my lesson. Elisabeth Egan is an editor at the Book Review and the author of “A Window Opens.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
