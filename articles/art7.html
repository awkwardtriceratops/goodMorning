A crowd began to make its way toward his stretch of Tobay Beach, on Long Island, and within minutes, an unmistakable gray dorsal fin appeared just a few feet from shore. “It’s a little one,” he said, running toward the water to haul the thrashing shark into the shallows. It was a sandbar shark (also known as a brown shark), about five feet long. Mr. Stefanou quickly withdrew the hook from its jaw. A friend stretched out a measuring tape while Mr. Stefanou, a lean and athletic 24-year-old, straddled the shark and plunged a sharp metal tag into its back muscle, near the dorsal fin. More than a dozen onlookers snapped photos. “Tag No. 13, male, 59 inches,” he announced before guiding the animal back into the waves and watching it swim off. Like that, it was over. This was the 71st shark he had caught on Long Island this summer. Catching sharks off the New York coast is nothing new. For generations, recreational surf fishermen, some of them local legends with names like Kayak Joe and Stingray Steve, have been hooking sandbar sharks or duskies or sand tigers — usually unintentionally, as bycatch to bluefish and striped bass. But with warming seas and abundant prey, sharks are passing closer and closer to the South Shore each summer. And for a younger crop of Long Island surf-casters looking for impressive photos to post on social media, the thrill of landing an apex predator is irresistible. At times, it can be a brutal and bloody spectacle. The sharks often bleed from the hooks, and the fishermen sometimes bleed from the sharks’ coarse, armor-like skin. It usually takes more than one person to land a shark — at least one handling the rod and reel and another wrangling the animal. The prize is usually a very impressive selfie before the shark is released — or something darker. One picture shared in a private Facebook group this summer showed a sand tiger shark discarded on a Long Island beach with its head cut off. “The shark angling community has a higher percentage of people that have this macho-man ‘I’m going to conquer giant beasts’ attitude,” said David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist and shark expert at Arizona State University. One particular set of photos from July caused a stir: In them, a college student from suburban Manhasset, N.Y., posed for a series of pictures, flexing and reclining alongside a large shark he had caught and later released. In one, he pulled its nose up to show its teeth. “I was not a fan of what that guy did,” Mr. Stefanou said. Mr. Stefanou draws a sharp distinction between fishermen like “that guy” and himself. Even though he promotes his shark exploits on social media under the handle LI Sharkman, on the beach he expresses concern for the endangered species he catches and has spent several years learning how to handle the animals safely, he said. He also participates in a volunteer shark-tagging program managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a citizen-science effort that has produced useful data on shark migrations across oceans and up and down the coast. But the nature of land-based shark fishing, as opposed to fishing from a boat, brings a high probability that the shark will be harmed at some point between its initial hooking and ultimate release. “It’s really, really bad for a lot of reasons,” said Greg Metzger, field coordinator for the shark research program at the South Fork Natural History Museum on Long Island. “One of the misconceptions is that they’re helping science, because they’re collecting data and tagging the sharks. The problem is the handling of the shark,” he said. “And that’s where the real issue is.” Just because a shark swims away doesn’t mean it will survive for very long afterward, according to shark experts. Stress and exhaustion from the fight on the line — and abrasions from being dragged up the sand — can leave lasting damage. In almost no case, Dr. Shiffman said, should there be time to pose for photographs. “Doing it right, leaving the shark in the water so that its gills are partially submerged, you don’t get as cool a picture,” he said. “But you’re less likely to kill the shark.” Mr. Stefanou films everything — everything — to post on social media. He’s part fisherman, part showman, and his nearly 13,000 followers on Instagram are well acquainted with his shark-catching process: Hook an oily baitfish through the mouth and out through the top of the head. Fasten the line with the bait to a pressure-release rig dangling from a sturdy white drone. “Goin’ out!” he yelled, and the drone raced away from sunbathers sprawled on Tobay Beach, far from the children boogie-boarding in the waves. Then, a half-mile out, when it was over deep enough water, he barked, “Kill it!” and his girlfriend, Savannah Comodo, locked the reel with a flick of the hand. The baited hook dropped into the sea with a distant splash amid the whitecaps and the gulls.
