By Corina Knoll Even as the coronavirus is ravaging the country and the world, a new reality is emerging in New York City. Nowhere is that more evident than on a stretch of 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens, that is now a lively symbol of renewal in a neighborhood where the virus infected one in 22 people and claimed 260 lives. Residents began trickling to the partially closed-off street soon after the deadliest days had passed. Strollers and wheelchairs appeared.
