Delayed the First Day of School<br></h1><p id="artcont">NEW YORK TODAY By Troy Closson [Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Wednesday. Weather: A wet start to the day, with patchy fog, though skies might clear some in the afternoon. High around 80. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Monday (Labor Day). Read about the amended regulations here. Over the past few weeks, teachers and principals have rushed to prepare for the return of 1.1 million children to public schools across New York City. Now they have a little more time to do so. On Tuesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that in-person  classes would start on Sept. 21 — 10 days later than initially planned. The shift came as pressure intensified on the mayor to delay the school year, as many educators said classrooms would not be ready to reopen next week. Still, New York is on track to be the only major city in the country to bring students into physical classrooms this fall.

Once the semester starts, most families that have opted for in-person learning will send their children to school one to three days per week to allow for social distancing. Starting in October, the city will also require random monthly coronavirus testing in all schools, with results that will be ready within 48 hours, the mayor said. Mr. de Blasio has said he will not reopen schools — or will close them — if the city’s test positivity rate ticks above 3 percent. For weeks, it has hovered around 1 percent. Many teachers, raising alarm about ventilation in classrooms and testing for staff members and students, had asked for the first day of school to be moved back. Some principals also supported a delay, saying that families’ wide-ranging safety concerns about in-person learning might not be addressed in time. Mr. de Blasio had insisted that schools would be ready to reopen on Sept. 10. The pressure to change those plans mounted this week, when the city’s powerful teachers’ union was poised to authorize an illegal strike for its 75,000 members. The delay came as districts across the country were watching New York City’s reopening effort. Every other big-city mayor has opted to start the school year fully remote. Research on reopenings in other countries with similar virus transmission rates suggests that New York City’s plan could work if case numbers remain low. If successful, the effort could help stabilize the city’s sputtering economy, as many employers believe that school reopenings will play a big role in whether people return to work. [A parent’s toughest call: In-person schooling or not?] Some parent groups had joined calls for Mr. de Blasio to postpone the reopening by at least a week, and while Tuesday’s decision provided that, the news also left many working families little time to rearrange their schedules. Still, the tone shifted among some of the loudest critics of the mayor’s initial plan. Michael Mulgrew, the leader of the teachers’ union, had previously suggested that reopening schools without a delay would cause “one of the biggest debacles in history.” After the mayor’s announcement, he said, “We now can say that the New York City public schools system has the most aggressive policies and safeguards of any school system in America.” After 5 Months, N.Y.C.
