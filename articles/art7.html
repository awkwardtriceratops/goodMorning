By Benjamin Mueller LONDON — A peer in the House of Lords, Britain’s unelected second chamber of Parliament, drew heavy criticism from lawmakers on Monday for referring on Twitter to Kamala Harris, the United States vice president-elect, simply as “the Indian.” The peer, Lord Kilclooney, a former elected member of Parliament from Northern Ireland, said on Twitter on Monday: “What happens if Biden moves on and the Indian becomes President. Who then becomes Vice President?” Ms. Harris, the daughter of an Indian-American mother and a Jamaican-American father, is the first woman and first woman of color to be elected vice president of the United States. Lord Kilclooney tried to defend his post by saying that he had not known Ms. Harris’s name when he wrote it, the BBC reported, but British lawmakers condemned the comment as transparently racist. “This sort of racism would be unacceptable from anyone, but from a member of the House of Lords it beggars belief,” said Wes Streeting, a Labour lawmaker. “Action must be taken.” Lord Fowler, who as Lord Speaker of the House of Lords presides over the chamber, demanded that Lord Kilclooney apologize.
