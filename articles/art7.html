By Chuck Rocha Mr. Rocha is the author of the book “Tío Bernie: The Inside Story of How Bernie Sanders Brought Latinos Into the Political Revolution.” In less than four years, the Trump administration has done great damage to the Latino community. And yet, though Donald Trump is widely disliked by Latino voters, he won 28 percent of the Latino vote in 2016, and he is still the choice of nearly 20 percent — enough support to make a difference in a close election. You’d think that Latino voters would rally behind Joe Biden, but he has struggled to connect with them. By some estimates, nearly 60 percent of eligible Latino voters in battleground states, who tend to view Mr. Trump unfavorably, will sit out the 2020 election. Rallying these mostly young voters will be vital to capturing the White House. As a senior adviser for Senator Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign, I led the historic $15 million Latino outreach program that secured victories in Nevada and California, and helped us compete hard everywhere Latinos could hear our message. To many, Senator Sanders, an older, white man from Vermont, can seem like an unlikely hero for the Latino community. But, as the son of an immigrant, Tío Bernie was relatable to these voters. He was the first Democratic presidential candidate to establish a presence in the Latino community and engage with its members. It’s not an impossible feat to repeat; Mr. Biden can take a page out of our playbook. Mr. Biden has begun to ramp up investment in communications to Latinos, but he has to go further. That includes expanding the universe of Latino voters he’s talking to and engaging with them across different platforms. The Sanders 2020 campaign worked to reach all the Latinos that were eligible to vote in Nevada ahead of the caucus — including the over 100,000 newly registered as well as those with no history of voting. We integrated Latino organizers into our staff and reached out to Latino voters early and often. We visited them at their homes and work sites. We connected with them via phone, bilingual radio ads and mailers. We organized community-based events like soccer tournaments where we’d register voters and host caucus trainings. Our strategy worked — Senator Sanders won 73 percent of Nevada’s Latino vote. He also won big in California and Colorado.
