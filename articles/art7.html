By Richard Sandomir Ray Cave, who as the managing editor of Time magazine for eight years oversaw changes to its stodgy look and encouraged the publication of single-subject issues like “Children of War,” died on Monday at his home in Boothbay, Me. He was 91. His daughter, C.C. Cave, confirmed the death. Mr. Cave became Time's top editor in the fall of 1977, when the magazine was still a swaggering journalistic force, unimpeded by competition from the internet. Time was the leading newsweekly when weekly magazines were still flourishing. Its pages were flush with ads. “The magazine’s goal,” Mr. Cave told Adweek in 1983 when it named him “the hottest editor” in its annual magazine report, “is to inform the public, to help our society debate more issues, and on occasion to help shape that debate.” Under Mr. Cave, there were more lifestyle cover articles on subjects like cats, ice cream and cholesterol; new sections like American Scene, Computers, Video and Food; and, in 1982, the anointing of the Machine of the Year (the personal computer), a departure from the traditional Man or Woman of the Year (now Person of the Year) issue. The single-subject issues published under Mr. Cave included ones about Japan, prisons and “Children of War,” a 25,000-word article written in 1982 by Roger Rosenblatt, a magazine essayist. Mr. Rosenblatt said that Mr. Cave approved his idea — to depict the lives of children in five war zones around the world — without hesitation. In an interview, Mr. Rosenblatt recalled fearing that a passage he had written might imperil the life of a 15-year-old Vietnamese boy, one of many refugees who fled their homeland and were known as boat people, who had accused a boat captain of murder. Hours before the Asian edition was to be printed, he called Mr. Cave. “I told Ray I had screwed up,” Mr. Rosenblatt said. “I asked him, ‘Can I rewrite it in a way that fudges it?’ And he said, ‘Go ahead.’ “It was a two-line fix that cost the magazine $65,000. He didn’t think about it. I don’t know how many people would do that.” An intensely competitive executive, Mr. Cave kept up Time’s rivalry with Newsweek, the No. 2 newsweekly. In early 1978, he learned that Newsweek was going to publish excerpts in successive issues from the memoirs of H.R. Haldeman, President Richard M. Nixon’s disgraced chief of staff, who had served 18 months in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal. To blunt Newsweek’s scoop, Mr. Cave countered with a cover article about Muhammad Ali (who had recently lost his heavyweight title), followed by one the next week about the supermodel Cheryl Tiegs, which became one of Time’s best-selling issues to date. In 1985, Time won the National Magazine Award for general excellence. Jim Kelly, a staff writer under Mr. Cave who became Time’s managing editor in 2001, recalled Mr. Cave as so stubborn on small matters, like headlines, that it was sometimes not worth bothering him about larger issues. “I learned how important it was for a Time editor to dig in his heels,” Mr. Kelly wrote in an email, “though I never made as big a dent in the ground as he did.” Ray Charles Cave was born Ray Roberts on May 27, 1929, in Tacoma, Wash. His father, also named Ray, was an assistant district attorney in Tacoma who died in a car accident in 1933. His mother, Agnes (Hansen) Roberts, later married John Cave, a career military officer; he adopted Ray, who took his stepfather’s surname. Ray’s mother had been a bookkeeper and model at a local newspaper before her first marriage, and in the 1950s she edited textbooks. After graduating from St. John’s College in Annapolis, Md., in 1949, Mr. Cave began his journalism career as a reporter for The Southern Maryland Times. After eight years as a reporter and editor at The Baltimore Evening Sun — a period broken up by his service in Army counterintelligence in Japan and Korea from 1952 to 1954 — he joined Sports Illustrated in 1959. Time and Sports Illustrated were then both owned by Time Inc. He was a reporter for a few years — one of his articles, in 1961, was about a college basketball point-shaving scandal — but he preferred editing. He edited a seminal series by Jack Olsen about Black athletes in 1968 and a previously unpublished nonfiction manuscript about a Kenyan safari by Ernest Hemingway, which ran in three issues in 1971. “I don’t think you can overstate how important Ray Cave was in the evolution of Sports Illustrated becoming what it was by the early 1970s — one of the best-written, best-edited magazines in America,” Michael MacCambridge, the author of “The Franchise: A History of Sports Illustrated Magazine” (1997), said in an interview. By 1974, Mr. Cave had become a trusted deputy of its longtime managing editor, Andre Laguerre. But after Mr. Laguerre retired, it was Roy Terrell who succeeded him and not Mr. Cave. “SI gets a new editor,” Mr. Cave wrote to his children in a career reminiscence several years ago. “Miffed. Should have been me.” He joined Time as an assistant managing editor in 1976 and, a year later, was the surprise selection as managing editor, succeeding Henry A. Grunwald. Jason McManus, another editor at Time, had been expected to get the job. “This time the other guy was miffed,” Mr. Cave wrote. Mr. Cave had strong feelings about how Time should look. As an editor at Sports Illustrated, he had mastered production techniques that filled the pages with color photography on tight deadlines. He brought the same skills to improving the photography at Time.
