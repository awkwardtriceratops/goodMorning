One expert said: “It’s just par for the course this year.” MARKETS ON FRIDAY S&P 500 3,348.42 0.96 Dow 27,682.81 0.48 Nasdaq 11,075.02 2.22 S&P 500 By Matt Phillips and Eshe Nelson There’s a pandemic, an economic recovery that’s losing steam, stalled stimulus talks in Congress and a deeply contentious election that has raised the specter of a constitutional crisis. As if that were not enough to make investors anxious, President Trump provided another reason to worry in the wee hours of Friday. Mr. Trump’s late-night announcement on Twitter that he had tested positive for the coronavirus was the latest in a long list of frustrating variables for investors eager for signs of stability. Perhaps that’s why the disclosure of Mr. Trump’s illness had a more muted effect on the market than some presidential health scares of the past. “It’s less of an event than you might think because it hasn’t come out of the clear blue sky, it’s just come in the midst of other confusion,” said Charles Geisst, a market historian and emeritus professor of finance at Manhattan College. “This sort of stuff is just not unexpected anymore. It’s just par for the course this year.” Even as the pandemic made its way into the Oval Office, the S&P 500 closed down just 1 percent — a rather ordinary day, considering the Labor Department reported that employers brought back nearly 200,000 fewer jobs in September than economists had expected. The slide in shares was nowhere near the punch of the September 1955 news that President Dwight D. Eisenhower had a heart attack, a bulletin that sent the S&P 500 down 6.6 percent in a day. And when President Ronald Reagan was shot on March 30, 1981, the news was enough to halt stock trading, which helped limit losses to just 0.3 percent. (When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, the sell-off was 2.8 percent in an abbreviated session.) “After an initial reaction, the news is only likely to have a lasting market impact if it’s seen as influencing the election outcome or public health,” Paul Donovan, the chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to clients.
