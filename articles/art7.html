By Rachel L. Harris and Lisa Tarchak Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants. Can you sum up the past six months in six words? In a recent Op-Ed, Larry Smith, the creator of the Six Word Memoirs project, observes that times of extremes — “our toughest and most joyous moments” — are often ideal for his brand of succinct storytelling. His collection of pandemic-inspired memoirs, gathered from writers across the country, inspired us to challenge our readers to write theirs too. The result has been thousands of six-word stories, submitted from people all over the world via Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Letters to the Editor and the comments on Mr. Smith’s essay, including one particularly poignant contribution from the author Min Jin Lee: “How will my broken heart mend?” A selection of some of our other favorites follows. And may we offer up: Thank you, readers. Your words resonate. Zooming through life. Getting nowhere fast.
