By Raphael Minder SEVILLE, Spain — He leaked files that led to the prosecution of one of the biggest labor corruption scandals in Spain’s history. But instead of being lauded for whistle-blowing, he was charged with revealing workplace secrets and sentenced to two years in prison. The leaker, Roberto Macías, filed an appeal this month in a case that highlights the weak protections given to whistle-blowers in many of the member states of the European Union — and the bloc’s efforts to strengthen them. More than half of European nations, including Spain, offer little to no national protection for whistle-blowers, undermining efforts to fight corruption. But an E.U. law passed in 2019 requires organizations of more than 50 employees to set up internal channels for people to report wrongdoing, and then to act upon such information within three months of receiving it. Enforcement of it could help the bloc recoup billions of dollars siphoned off by corruption. Weak or nonexistent whistle-blower laws waste €5.8 to €9.6 billion each year in public procurement spending alone, according to a 2017 study by the European Commission. Mr. Macías is one of the first people to test Europe’s new commitment to require member states to protect whistle-blowers. In his appeal, he is arguing that the law obligates Spain to safeguard him rather than punish him. Member states have until December 2021 to adopt the new law, but all E.U. citizens can already sue under it. “This case should allow us to see how Europe’s political commitment to fighting corruption translates into practice in a country like Spain,” said Fruitós Richarte i Travesset, a former Spanish judge who is now a law professor at the Rovira i Virgili University. Mr. Richarte i Travesset added that Spain “needs to change not only its legislation but also its mentality, because every advanced society should encourage citizens to denounce fraud.” Spain’s lawmakers have been debating how to strengthen the country’s anti-corruption laws since 2016, but have been unable to agree on how to do so. The most recent proposal — by the Ciudadanos party — was voted down by Parliament in June. Left-wing parties argued that the law, which targeted public corruption, did not go far enough in addressing corporate and individual fraud.
