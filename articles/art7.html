As amenities sit unused in the pandemic, airports reconsider their design. The latest: Uber and Lyft ponder franchise-like model. Markets wavered in Europe as traders took stock of the latest escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China. Shares in Europe started lower but then edged into positive territory, with the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 up 0.2 percent in late morning trading. Asian markets ended their day decidedly mixed, with stocks in China rising while indexes in Japan and South Korea fell. Futures on Wall Street were predicting a slightly higher open. The yield on a 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell, while Brent crude gained about 0.3 percent, to about $45.50 a barrel, and West Texas Intermediate was nearly flat, at $42.90 a barrel. Gold was up more than 1 percent, at $2,008 an ounce. On Monday the Trump administration said it would restrict the ability of the Chinese tech giant Huawei to buy a wider array of chips made or designed with American equipment and software. The rule marks a tightening of rules first announced in May, applying them to more semiconductors, covering any chips made abroad with American equipment. The United States has taken several steps to crack down on China’s technology sector; this month, it moved to curb Americans’ dealings with TikTok, the viral video app owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, and WeChat, a popular Chinese messaging service. In a reminder of the cost of the deep global recession, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest with more than $1 trillion in assets, reported that it lost more than $21 billion in the first half of the year as stocks and real estate holdings tumbled in value. The decline followed profits of $180 billion last year. The fund’s deputy chief executive, speaking at a news conference, said the coronavirus’s spread continued to pose a risk to financial markets. “The main thing is the pandemic. It is still a global pandemic. It does not seem to be under control in any shape or form,” said the executive, Trond Grande, Reuters reported. — Kevin Granville Marks & Spencer, the British department store and food retailer, announced plans on Tuesday to cut 7,000 jobs in the next three months, or nearly 10 percent of its work force. The staff reductions will be in stores, its central office and across regional management. The pandemic has dealt a deep blow to many of Britain’s most well-known retail brands, including Boots, John Lewis and Debenhams, which have also announced thousands of layoffs and store closures in recent weeks. Just four weeks ago, M & S said it expected to cut 950 jobs. The acceleration and expansion of its restructuring plans comes as many retail areas have struggled to attract shoppers even as social-distancing measures have eased in Britain. According to Springboard data on retail activity, foot traffic on high streets and shopping centers is still down by more than a third compared to last year. Central London and other regional cities also have far fewer shoppers than market towns or suburban locations. In a trading update on Tuesday, the Marks and Spencer Group said food sales over the last three-month period were up 2.5 percent compared with the same period last year, while clothing and home sales were down 38.5 percent. Overall revenue for the whole company was still lower than last year, even though online sales had risen by more than 40 percent. Despite being an iconic British retailer, M & S has been struggling for years. In 2018, the company said it planned to close 100 stores by 2022. It has spent the past few years moving away from clothing and home goods and promoting its food business, while also trying to get more of its products online. The company’s share price has dropped 78 percent in the past five years.
