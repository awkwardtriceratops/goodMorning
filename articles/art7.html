By Elizabeth Bruenig Ms. Bruenig is an Opinion writer. I have said goodbye to Bernie Sanders before. There was the parting pageantry of the 2016 Democratic Convention where Mr. Sanders conceded the nomination to Hillary Clinton, closing out a primary season so tight it had given even the most pessimistic of leftists a thrill of hope. As he called for unity against Donald Trump in his farewell, the news network’s camera found a crying 22-year-old Bernie delegate in a Robin Hood hat, and the internet tore him apart. Laugh it up, I thought; there will be a next time. When next time came, the hope died in the spring and Joe Biden trounced him. First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you lose. After Mr. Sanders suspended his 2020 campaign, there was no next time to dream about. Mr. Sanders is nearly 80 years old now, and after his heart attack on the campaign trail in 2019, he has no plans to run again. Whoever comes next, it’s not going to be Bernie. Both of us knew that as we spoke on the phone last week, me holed up in insufferable midsummer Washington, D.C., and him enjoying the free New England air. “When I’m in Washington, I don’t go outside,” Mr. Sanders told me, laughing, “and when I’m in Vermont, I don’t go inside. So there you go.” He sounded genuinely upbeat. I wasn’t. My first question made that clear: Is it all over? “No!” he groaned, at typical volume, “I sound like my great-grandmother here. No. Don’t have that attitude.” When leftists express despair about Mr. Sanders’s loss, we are often condescendingly assured that we won the war of ideas, a consolation prize after losing the war for power. Mr. Sanders was supposed to have won the war of ideas before, back in 2016, and two years later, a slew of Sanders-backed candidates lost their midterm primaries. If gains made in the realm of ideas don’t translate into democratic power, what difference do they make? Wall Street rallied last week after Mr. Biden announced he would run with Senator Kamala Harris, signaling to markets that they need not worry about dramatic change under a Biden-Harris administration. Seeing as Medicare for All, Mr. Sanders’ flagship policy and the main focus of his young movement, did not even make it into the Democratic platform this year, that reasoning is probably sound. “Look, how could it make it when you have a candidate who is strongly opposed to it?” Mr. Sanders countered when I brought up the platform’s omission of one of his key programs. Does that make him nervous? “Of course it makes me nervous,” he said, but “I have a little bit of experience in this. And here’s the thing: It takes a two-pronged approach.” The first prong, Mr. Sanders explained, is to focus on electing Mr. Biden — because the alternative is Mr. Trump, whose regime could, in Mr. Sanders’ view, endanger the progressive cause in ways far more damaging than one led by moderate Democrats. “This is a guy who believes in voter suppression,” he said of Mr. Trump. “We are fighting for American democracy — for whether we have free elections in this country, or whether you will have an antidemocratic pathological liar running this country. On this issue, there can be not one doubt.” Mr. Sanders’ movement relies on the idea that transformative change is possible using the normal levers of American governance — which is a point of contention among leftists. But it would be impossible to accomplish without a functional democracy. Whatever Mr. Biden may be up to, in Mr. Sanders’s view, he’s at least in favor of that much. Which isn’t to say he’s content with the moderate, business-friendly politics Mr. Biden favors. And that’s where the second prong comes in.
