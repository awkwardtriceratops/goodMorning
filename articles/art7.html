By Emma G. Fitzsimmons Coronavirus testing in New York City has been plagued with problems since the early days of the pandemic. First, limited supplies meant most New Yorkers couldn’t get tested. Once capacity increased, many people experienced long delays in getting results as national labs couldn’t meet the increased demand while the virus spread across the country. But with schools in the city set to reopen for some students this month, reliable and quick testing will be key to keeping students, parents and teachers safe. Now, the city is offering several options for families to get results within 48 hours. Where you get tested can make a huge difference. Health officials recommend visiting one of the city’s priority testing sites or one of the new rapid testing clinics.
