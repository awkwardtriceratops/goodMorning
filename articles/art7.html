In a letter to readers, Aminda Marqués González, the executive editor and publisher of The Miami Herald and El Nuevo Herald, and Nancy San Martín, El Nuevo Herald’s managing editor, said that they had “notified Libre that we are ending our relationship and will never publish, print or distribute its content again.” In a column last week, headlined “Judíos americanos y judíos israelíes,” the author, Roberto Luque-Escalona, chastised American Jews who support Black Lives Matter and antifa by comparing those movements to the Nazi-led Germans who instigated a fatal pogrom against German Jews in 1938. “What kind of people are these Jews?” Mr. Luque-Escalona wrote of American Jewish supporters of Black Lives Matter and antifa. “They are always talking about the Holocaust, but have they now forgotten Kristallnacht, when Nazi thugs razed Jewish businesses throughout Germany? The same is being done by B.L.M. and Antifa, only the Nazis did not rob; they only destroyed.” In fact, during and after the night of Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass, in November 1938, many Jewish-owned businesses in Germany were looted as well as destroyed, and Jews were forced to pay for the damage, according to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum and research center in Israel. “We are deeply sorry that inflammatory, racist and anti-Semitic commentary reached our el Nuevo Herald subscribers through Libre, a Spanish-language publication that paid our company to have the product printed and inserted into our print edition as a weekly supplement,” Ms. Marqués González and Ms. Martín wrote in their apology. Libre, whose English-language motto is “For a Free World and a Better Community,” was founded in 1966 in Miami, according to its website. It did not return a request for comment Wednesday. Libre’s publisher is Demetrio Perez Jr., a former member of the Miami-Dade school board. In 2001, The Sun Sentinel reported that he had been sentenced to six months house arrest and given 18 months probation after he was indicted on charges that he defrauded the federal housing program. A personal website for Mr. Perez Jr. identifies him as a Cuban-American educator and activist based in Miami.
