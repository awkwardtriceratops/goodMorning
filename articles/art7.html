Even I Was Shocked by This Cronyism.<br></h1><p id="artcont">A privately owned entity created by the Export-Import Bank allows its customers to also be its owners. By Veronique de Rugy Ms. de Rugy is a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Right under the nose of a president who promised to drain the swamp, one of the government’s shadiest handouts to large banks and big companies looks like it will be renewed for another 25 years. It will not get adequate oversight and congressional review. All it will take is the approval of two out of three U.S. Export-Import Bank directors, who are political appointees. That entity is called the Private Export Funding Corporation, or PEFCO. I study corporate welfare, and even I was surprised to discover a government entity with such unchecked cronyism and self-dealing. How did it fly under the radar? Despite increasing taxpayers’ exposure to bank debt, it hasn’t received a public review since it made its first loan in 1971. At the urging of banking lobbyists, the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Uncle Sam’s credit agency that provides financing to encourage American exports) created PEFCO, a private entity owned by over two dozen banks and a handful of big corporations. It has operated under consecutive 25-year mandates with an exclusive arrangement, under special terms, to acquire Export-Import Bank loans from commercial lenders; because these loans are fully backed by taxpayers, they impart no risk for the banks that issue them. PEFCO’s current authorization expires at the end of December, but the chair of the board of the Export-Import Bank apparently believes there is a rush and wants a vote next week. It should not be renewed — and in the meantime, its cozy dealings with big banks and corporations deserve far greater scrutiny. Consider this hypothetical: Boeing wants to sell airplanes to China Air. Boeing asks the Export-Import Bank to guarantee a loan to China Air so it can purchase the aircraft. JPMorgan Chase originates what becomes a loan from the Export-Import Bank — guaranteed by taxpayers — for China Air. (The bank earns interest at no risk because, even if the borrower defaults, taxpayers will cover it.) Then JP Morgan Chase turns around and sells the loan to PEFCO, which buys the loan using debt raised from investors that is separately guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank (again, American taxpayers). JPMorgan Chase is also a major shareholder of PEFCO, and PEFCO can pay its shareholders dividends. So JPMorgan Chase makes money off these transactions while sustaining zero risk. And the PEFCO business “model” protects its shareholders from any possible loss because all risk from the original Export-Import Bank loan and the new debt issued by PEFCO falls on to taxpayers. Is this arrangement worse than the hundreds of other government-guaranteed loan programs already on the books? Qualitatively, it is. The Export-Import Bank has been criticized for its cronyism, but PEFCO adds insult to injury because most of its shareholders are also its customers (like JPMorgan in our hypothetical above).
