By Ruth Graham, Elizabeth Dias and Frances Robles The leadership of Jerry Falwell Jr., one of the most prominent evangelical supporters of President Trump, appeared to be nearing an end at Liberty University after a report emerged on Monday of sexual indiscretions involving Mr. Falwell, his wife and a pool attendant. Top officials at Liberty, which Mr. Falwell helped build into a hugely influential, $1.6 billion center of evangelical power, were seeking to finalize the terms of Mr. Falwell’s departure as the university’s president and chancellor. The situation was confusing on Monday night, with a school spokesman telling news organizations that Mr. Falwell had resigned, Mr. Falwell denying those reports, and an official with knowledge of the behind-the-scenes drama asserting that the terms were still being negotiated. “Falwell has not yet resigned but he’s in negotiations with the school over his future,” said a person who was in touch with key players in the negotiations on Monday but was not authorized to speak on the record. On Monday evening Mr. Falwell told Virginia Business, a local monthly magazine, that reports of his resignation were “completely false” and that he did not plan to step down. It was clear that Mr. Falwell’s support had eroded. Late on Monday evening, the university released a statement saying that Mr. Falwell had initially agreed to resign before reversing course. His actions came after the board’s executive committee met on Monday morning.
