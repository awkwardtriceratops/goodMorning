LeMahieu and Giancarlo Stanton are all on the injured list. Even in a shortened season, the Yankees aren’t rushing to bring them back. By James Wagner Stop us if you’ve heard this before: The Yankees have one of the best records in Major League Baseball despite missing several star players to injury. No, this is not 2019, when the Yankees endured a nightmarish run of setbacks and sent a major-league record 30 players to the injured list. But this season has certainly felt eerily similar in the Bronx. In the span of eight days, the Yankees placed three of their best players — outfielders Giancarlo Stanton (left hamstring strain) and Aaron Judge (right calf strain), and infielder D.J. LeMahieu — on the 10-day injured list. LeMahieu, who was hitting an American League-leading .411, was the latest casualty, exiting Saturday’s game against the Boston Red Sox with a left thumb sprain. Losing three All-Star-caliber players at once is painful enough during a traditional 162-game regular season. But in this pandemic-shortened 60-game campaign, a minimum stint on the 10-day injured list is the equivalent of missing 27 days in a normal year. “Any time off is not good,” Judge said on Sunday. “That’s why I was begging for just a couple days, not really 10 days.”
