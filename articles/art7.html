By David Leonhardt Want to get The Morning by email? Here’s the sign-up. President Trump breaks so many of the normal rules of politics that it can sometimes be hard to know when his tweets and comments are truly newsworthy. Even by his standards, though, the past several days have stood out. Consider: Trump said on Monday that a plane “almost completely loaded with thugs” wearing “dark uniforms” had been headed to the Republican National Convention to do “big damage.” The claim is similar to a baseless conspiracy theory that spread online over the summer, well before the convention. He has declined to condemn the killings of two protesters in Kenosha, Wis. He instead defended the 17-year-old charged in the shootings — a Trump supporter named Kyle Rittenhouse — saying he was acting in self-defense. Trump also promoted a Twitter post that called Rittenhouse “a good example of why I decided to vote for Trump.” He defended violence committed by his supporters in Portland, Ore., who fired paintballs and pepper spray at Black Lives Matter protesters. He compared the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha to missing “a three-foot putt” in a golf tournament. He claimed that “people that you’ve never heard of” and “people that are in the dark shadows” are controlling Joe Biden. He claimed Democrats were trying to “destroy” suburbs with “low-income housing, and with that comes a lot of other problems, including crime.” He added that Cory Booker — one of the highest-profile Black Democrats — would be “in charge of it.” He predicted that the stock market would crash if Biden won. He said that Biden, at the Democratic National Convention, “didn’t even discuss law enforcement, the police. Those words weren’t mentioned.” In fact, Biden held a discussion at the convention on policing, with a police chief. Trump claimed that he “took control of” the situation in Kenosha by sending in the National Guard. In fact, Wisconsin’s governor, not the president, sent the National Guard. He retweeted messages asserting that the pandemic’s death toll was overstated. Evidence indicates the opposite is true. He said that protests against police brutality were actually a secret “coup attempt” by anarchists “trying to take down the President.” Biden has taken a very different approach to the unrest in Kenosha, Portland and elsewhere. He has told no apparent untruths, and he has criticized violence from both the political left and right — even though many liberals, whose votes Biden needs, are uncomfortable with any criticism of people on their side of the debate. G.O.P. reaction. The Times tried to reach about a dozen leading congressional Republicans and ask for their reaction to Trump’s claims. “None cared to comment,” Mark Leibovich writes. Senator Mitt Romney offered one of the few public responses, calling the president’s comments “simply jaw-dropping.” Russia adds to the misinformation. A group backed by the Kremlin is again trying to meddle in the U.S. presidential election and push voters toward Trump, Facebook and Twitter said yesterday. President Trump traveled to Kenosha, Wis., yesterday to offer support for law enforcement and to tour shops damaged by rioting. During the visit, Trump did not mention the name of Jacob Blake, an unarmed Black man shot by the police last week, nor did the president speak with his family. On the corner where Blake was shot, family members and activists held a festival to promote community healing. “We know why Trump is here in Kenosha today,” Tanya McLean, an organizer, told hundreds of people who gathered. “He is here to sow chaos and fear. We reject these attempts to divide us.” New York City, which has the largest school system in the U.S., pushed the first day of in-person school by 10 days, to Sept. 21, to give teachers and administrators more time to prepare. Among New York’s safety protocols: Most kids will go to school between one and three days a week; everyone will wear masks all day; and windows will remain open, even on cold and rainy days.

In other virus developments: The Trump administration announced an order yesterday to bar evictions for most renters for the rest of the year. The U.S. will not join a global effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine and equitably distribute doses across nations, The Washington Post reports. Part of the reason: The World Health Organization, which the Trump administration has criticized, is involved in the plan. Incumbents won both high-profile Democratic primaries in Massachusetts yesterday. Senator Ed Markey defeated Joseph P. Kennedy III by about 10 percentage points. It was the first loss by a Kennedy in a statewide race in Massachusetts. And Representative Richard Neal beat Alex Morse, the 31-year-old mayor of Holyoke with backing from progressives. The race received national attention after a sex-scandal smear campaign against Morse was exposed.
