Novak Djokovic Is in His Way.<br></h1><p id="artcont">If Nadal defeats Djokovic on Sunday for his 13th championship at Roland Garros, he will match Roger Federer’s 20 singles titles in Grand Slam tournaments. By Christopher Clarey It should come as no surprise that Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic will meet in another French Open final. Djokovic is No. 1 and has not lost a completed match in this disjointed 2020 tennis season. Nadal is No. 2 and the greatest clay-court player in the game’s long history. Nadal will be aiming for his 13th French Open title, Djokovic for his second. Both advanced on Friday with victories over seeded opponents who had reason to hope for better. Nadal won, 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (0), against Diego Schwartzman, who upset him on clay in the Italian Open last month. Djokovic won, 6-3, 6-2, 5-7, 4-6, 6-1, against Stefanos Tsitsipas, who had beaten him twice in five previous matches and who pushed him to the limit this time. But Sunday’s showdown — the 56th match in the rich rivalry between Nadal and Djokovic, and their third meeting in the French Open final — will be about more than winning this unique October edition of Roland Garros. It will be about the historical pecking order. If Nadal prevails, he will equal Roger Federer’s men’s record of 20 Grand Slam singles titles. If Djokovic prevails, he will narrow the gap with his longtime rivals. The title would be his 18th and would make him the first of the so-called Big Three to win each of the four majors twice. Numbers, so many numbers. It is part of their legacy, and at times, their burden. Djokovic has the overall edge against Nadal, with a 29-26 advantage, but Nadal leads by 17-7 on clay and by 6-1 at Roland Garros. Djokovic is one of only two men to have defeated Nadal in this tournament. Robin Soderling beat Nadal in the fourth round in 2009, and Djokovic beat him in the quarterfinals in 2015, a rare downbeat year in Nadal’s career. Nadal is bracing himself for Sunday’s final against Djokovic. “He is one of the toughest opponents possible, but I am here to keep trying my best,” he said. “I know I have to make a step forward. I think I did one today, but for Sunday, it’s not enough. I need to make another one.” Djokovic has certainly had the harder road to the final. While Nadal has not dropped a set in six matches, Djokovic has dropped three in his last two — going four sets with Pablo Carreño Busta in the quarterfinals and five with Tsitsipas, the swashbuckling 22-year-old Greek. Djokovic was in control of the match until he served for a straight-set victory at 5-4 in the third set and, on match point, missed a backhand just wide going for a winner. Tsitsipas rallied to win the next three games and the set. Tsitsipas defeated Federer to reach his first Grand Slam semifinal at the 2019 Australian Open and also won last year’s ATP Finals, often considered the fifth most prestigious event in men’s tennis, after the majors. But he has struggled to close matches of late, blowing six match points against Borna Coric in a third-round loss at the U.S. Open. Though he came close on Friday, he could not cross the finish line ahead of Djokovic, an elastic Serbian who at age 33 was the fresher player. “My body was not ready,” Tsitsipas said wearily. Djokovic closed out the victory with a string of return winners and more of the drop shots that were so effective throughout the match. “He has reached almost perfection, Novak, in his game style, the way he plays, which is unbelievable to see, honestly,” Tsitsipas said. “That inspires me a lot to go out and work and try to reach that perfectionism, that ability to have everything on the court.” Against Schwartzman, Nadal imposed his skill and his will, and he had made clear adjustments since their match at the Italian Open that went the other way. “The experience of Rome helped me in some way because I was able to take a look at the match,” Nadal said after Friday’s semifinal, which lasted three hours and nine minutes. “To analyze the things that worked well and things that, of course, didn’t work.” He added, “We tried to go on court with a plan, with the right determination.” Nadal, if he prevails in the final, will have won 100 matches at the French Open. But for once, the focus will not be on Nadal’s running total at Roland Garros. It will be on his pursuit of Federer’s Grand Slam singles record. Federer, 39, has not played since February because of two knee surgeries, and he does not plan to return to competition until 2021. Federer won his 20th major title at the 2018 Australian Open, but Nadal has steadily narrowed the gap since then — winning the French Open twice more and the United States Open in 2019 to bring his total to 19. Nadal, true to character, has downplayed the chase. “I am happy with who I am,” he said, tapping his chest with an index finger, in an interview with The New York Times earlier this year. “I was very happy with 16, very happy with 17, very happy with 18, very happy with 19, and if one day I get to 20, I will be very happy, too. But my level of happiness is not going to change because of this. Do I make myself clear?” When pressed, he has acknowledged that he is not immune to the lure of the history books. But he has always been more interested in looking forward to the next point, the next match, the next challenge than looking back at all the castles he has built on the clay and elsewhere. It is his not-so-secret weapon — that deep focus on process over destination. “It’s important to go through all the process,” he said Friday. “You have to suffer. You can’t pretend to be in a final of Roland Garros without suffering.” Though he was the reigning champion at the U.S. Open, he decided not to play in New York this year and remained at home in Majorca, Spain, where he trained on clay at his eponymous academy. He believed that the trip to the United States might wear him down for the abbreviated clay-court season, with the French Open starting just two weeks after the men’s U.S. Open final. So far, so smart, but he is on new ground here. He has never won the French Open without winning a clay-court tournament in the lead-up, and no one has ever won a French Open in October. His forehand is not bouncing as high in the cool conditions. His serve is not traveling as quickly: It is down, on average, four miles per hour from 2019. Despite all of the above, Nadal, 34, has yet to drop a set in the tournament. After fighting through a 14-minute opening game on Friday to hold serve against Schwartzman, he worked his way through the grinding first set, full of double-digit rallies and all-court hustle. He adjusted after losing to Schwartzman in Rome, moving in closer on first-serve returns and much closer on second-serve returns. That paid off Friday with six breaks, and though Schwartzman tried drop shots, they were not as consistently successful. The match tightened in the third set, however, as Nadal failed twice to hold serve after going up a break. At 5-5, he held serve after saving three break points, saving the last of those by serving and volleying for the first time in the match. Greatness is in the details, and Nadal is, contrary to popular image, a great tactician as well as a great athlete, ball striker and competitor. He went on to win the third-set tiebreaker, too, and is now just one victory away from ruling again at Roland Garros. It has been a reign no like other. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
