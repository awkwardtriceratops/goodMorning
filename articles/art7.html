Perhaps most notably, 64 percent of respondents said they had already voted. By Trip Gabriel and Isabella Grull√≥n Paz Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by three points in North Carolina, a battleground state that Mr. Trump won in 2016. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of 1,034 likely voters in North Carolina from Oct. 23 to Oct. 27. Joseph R. Biden Jr. holds a small but durable lead over President Trump in North Carolina, where fully 64 percent of likely voters say they have already cast their ballots, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll released on Thursday. In a crucial race for control of the Senate, Cal Cunningham, the Democrat, also maintained an edge over Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican, despite a late-breaking scandal over romantic texts Mr. Cunningham sent to a woman who is not his wife. Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump by 48 percent to 45 percent in the survey, which was conducted after the final presidential debate last week, from Friday to Tuesday. Nearly seven in 10 voters said they had watched the debate. At that event, Mr. Trump tried to present a more civil side to woo back Republicans put off by his spree of interruptions in his first encounter with Mr. Biden. North Carolinians were divided over the results: Thirty-six percent said Mr. Trump had won the debate, 35 percent thought Mr. Biden had, and 29 percent had no opinion. In the Senate matchup, Mr. Cunningham held a lead of three percentage points over Mr. Tillis, 46 to 43 percent.
