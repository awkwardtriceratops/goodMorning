By Charles M. Blow Opinion Columnist I have been to several presidential nominating conventions. My first was Bill Clinton’s in Madison Square Garden in 1992. The convening itself — the drawing together of the party’s faithful, the die-hards, the sizzle of their excitement — created the spectacle and the specialness. A part-political tent revival, part-cult congregational, lavish party. For that reason, it was hard to conceive of a virtual convention, dictated by social distancing as a deadly virus still rages. Indeed, as the Democratic National Convention opened Monday night, I feared that, despite all their efforts, the convention would fail to succeed. I was wrong. There was a particular charge and effectiveness of seeing people in situ, surrounded by their books, in their kitchens, on their lawn, in some place that is meaningful to them or the people they represent. The lack of a live audience also stripped away a bit of the performative nature of speeches and presentations; no pausing for applause, no way to know for certain if a line was landing. You simply had to deliver your speech. But yet another benefit was that because there was no roar of the crowd, everyone could be clearly heard; because there was no crowd, cameras stayed fixed on the speaker instead of panning to the audience. Some of the features of this convention should actually be preserved and repeated, even after we can meet again in large gatherings. But the Democrats’ message and their inclusiveness, not the format, have been the real stars of the convention. They have served to remind America of the beauty of its diversity and to encourage the continued quest for universal equality. This has not by any means been without hiccups. As Julián Castro, former Democratic presidential candidate and former secretary of housing and urban development, told NPR: “You know, last week I saw the schedule. And out of the 35 prime-time speakers, only three of them were Latino. There were no Native Americans, no Muslim Americans. And I said that that was — I didn’t think that completely reflected this beautiful, diverse coalition, this big tent that Democrats have put together over these last few years. However, over the weekend, they did make some good announcements of additional speakers, including Latinas and Latinos and Native American and Muslim-American speakers. So that’s a positive. And more important than, you know, the words is the actions.” Furthermore, some progressives have not been satisfied with their wing of the party’s level of representation at the convention, and many were not happy when Joe Biden said on the opening night of the convention that “most cops are good, but the fact is, the bad ones need to be identified and prosecuted.” Police defenders often offer up the “bad apples” theory on police misconduct, which implicitly suggests that our current system of policing is fine and functioning, and simply in need of a weeding. Many progressives take the opposite view: That the system of the police itself is corrupt, defiled, misdirected and bloated and must be dealt with as such. Still, all in all, the Democrats’ effort is succeeding and is a welcome note of positivity ahead of what surely will be a Republican convention filled with fear-mongering and divisiveness.
