Dangerously Close to Second Wave, Mayor Says, as New Rules Loom<br></h1><p id="artcont">The spike in virus cases threatens the city’s recovery and could mean “a lot more restrictions,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said. TRANSCRIPT Unfortunately we’re also dealing with an immense challenge this morning because we see the presence of the coronavirus in the city and it’s trying to reassert itself. And we have to do everything in our power while we’re waiting for that help from the federal government to finally come, we need to do everything in our power to stop the coronavirus from reasserting in New York City. We have to stop a second wave from happening here. It is getting dangerously close. I’ve been telling you for weeks that we had the ability to stop a second wave. And for weeks, actually, our numbers were higher than we wanted, but they had leveled off. Now, unfortunately, we’re seeing a real growth in the positivity rate in the city. And that is dangerous. So we have one last chance to stop a second wave. It’s as simple as this. This is my message to all New Yorkers today: We can stop a second wave if we act immediately. But we have one last chance. So the more that people wear masks, practice social distancing, all those basics, the more we’re able to fight back that second wave. So I can’t give you a timeline. It will actually depend on how people respond to your reporting and everything else we put out there. If they take decisive action, it can make a huge difference. But it is important, I think, to lay out the danger in terms of new restrictions because I think it will make it very visual, very real to people what we’re up against. God forbid this continued and we had a full-blown second wave, it means a lot more restrictions. It means, unfortunately, it could mean even having to shut down parts of our economy again, which would be horrible for this city, horrible for the livelihoods of people. By Joseph Goldstein and Dana Rubinstein As coronavirus cases surged to record highs across the country, New York City had hoped to keep the outbreak at bay and press ahead with its slow but steady recovery from the dark days of spring. But now, the forecast is turning more alarming. The number of new infections is swiftly rising, with more than 1,000 cases identified in the city for five days in a row, a level that last occurred in May, according to the state’s Department of Health. Just a month ago, daily cases were typically in the 500 to 700 range. Hospitalizations and death rates are a small fraction of what they were at the height of the outbreak in the spring, and case count comparisons can be tricky, given that much more testing is occurring now. The test positivity rate in New York City is still well below that in neighboring states. But as cases continue to surge in New Jersey, Connecticut and upstate New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday that the city was dealing with an “immense” challenge. “We have to stop a second wave from happening here,” Mr. de Blasio said during a news conference. “It is getting dangerously close.” The city’s contact-tracing program has disclosed few details about which trends and patterns are contributing to transmission. But one city health official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to share details from internal discussions, said some clusters had been traced to workplaces, including construction sites and offices. City health officials and Mr. de Blasio’s aides have been discussing whether new citywide restrictions should be imposed, including a broader shutdown of nonessential businesses, if the seven-day average rate of positive test results climbs, and stays, above 3 percent. The seven-day average was 2.26 percent, according to the city’s health department. The mayor said that further lockdowns were possible should New York City not regain control of the virus. “God forbid this continued and we had a full-blown second wave,” he said. “It means a lot more restrictions. Unfortunately, it could mean even having to shut down parts of our economy again.” It could also mean having to close schools, he said. “There’s one last chance to stop that, and we need everyone to participate,” Mr. de Blasio said. The mayor said he is watching three indicators to determine if the city is dealing with a “full-blown second wave”: the overall number of cases in New York City; the positivity rate, which should not breach 3 percent “on a sustained basis”; and the number of hospitalizations, which he doesn’t want to exceed 200 a day. Staten Island has recently emerged as a particular area of concern, with the positivity rate in the neighborhood of Tottenville exceeding 6 percent. Several other neighborhoods have rates surpassing 3 percent. There are some signs that Mr. de Blasio may be reluctant to impose new restrictions, which would require the acquiescence of the governor. The mayor has previously said that he favored halting indoor dining if the seven-day positivity rate reached 2 percent — a threshold that has already been crossed without his taking any action. On Monday, the mayor would only say that it was time to re-evaluate the wisdom of allowing limited indoor dining. The city health official said mayoral aides and health department officials were discussing whether the mayor should begin urging New Yorkers to cut back on visiting friends or resume working from home if they can — a recommendation that would hinder the return of workers to Midtown Manhattan office buildings, which are showing a few tentative signs of life. In a news conference on Monday, Mr. Cuomo said that state officials are monitoring the numbers but are not taking any immediate action. “This is going to be the constant for the foreseeable future,” the governor said. “Every couple of days we’ll say, ‘This place became a microcluster, this place is no longer a microcluster.’ ”
