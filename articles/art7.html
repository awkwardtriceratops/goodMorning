Deep-Fried Oreos Are Not.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Food vendors and their devoted fans are going to great lengths, from drive-throughs to phone apps, to keep the corn dogs and chickens-on-a-stick flowing. By Marissa Conrad Last October, to kick off her 20th year as a vendor at the North Carolina State Fair, Felicia Turrentine-Daniel unveiled the Chickenator: a cinnamon roll sliced like a hamburger bun to hold a deep-fried chicken breast, bacon, pepper Jack cheese and a drizzle of honeyed Sriracha. “We make sure that we bring in something new and big every year,” said Ms. Turrentine-Daniel, who runs the booth Chef’s D’Lites. She met her husband, Jason Daniel, while they both worked in a grocery store, “and we would literally walk up and down the aisles and find different things to put in the fryer, to see what came out.” On July 29, when North Carolina’s became the 35th state fair to be canceled or severely curtailed, her friends, family and regular customers called and emailed: Was she OK? And oh, by the way, was there any chance they could still order a deep-fried Cuban roll, or those fried banana pudding bites? On the Facebook page for Chef’s D’Lites, Ms. Turrentine-Daniel, 42, now accepts direct-message orders for dishes she can fry, freeze and ship, including the Cuban rolls and her deep-fried macaroni and cheese, with instructions on how to finish the dish in the oven, microwave or deep fryer. Chickenators don’t ship well, but she has delivered them fresh to customers who live within a 30-minute drive of her home in Greensboro. “Just meet me halfway, and we’ll work it out,” she said. Across the country, concessionaires are going to great lengths, from organizing drive-throughs to buying delivery trucks, to keep the fair-food pipeline intact as state fairs continue to be called off — so far, in 36 states and the District of Columbia — many for the first time since World War II. And fair regulars, the people who can tell you definitively which of eight near-identical cheese curd trailers is the best, or who keep annually updated checklists of foods on a stick, are coming out to support their favorite vendors. Lori Lexvold has attended the Minnesota State Fair, in a Twin Cities suburb, every summer for 53 of her 58 years. When it was called off in late May, “I thought, what in the world is going to happen to all these vendors?” she said. “This is their livelihood.” She heard that some were setting up where they could find space: church lawns, mall parking lots, outside a Harley-Davidson dealership. “I got on Facebook one morning and I created a group,” said Ms. Lexvold, who lives in Forest Lake, about a half-hour drive from the fairgrounds. “I invited about 100 of my friends. I just said, ‘Hey, if you see any food stands around, post it to this page, so we can all go.’” The group, Fair Food Finder, now has nearly 179,000 members, a Google map of 139 Minnesota vendors and a phone app created by an enthusiastic fan. “It was crazy,” Ms. Lexvold said of a time this summer when she was getting 10,000 requests a day from strangers wanting to join, and phone calls from vendors asking how to post on the page. “I thought, how in the dickens are you finding my phone number?” Ms. Lexvold found her fair-food fix at the Anoka County Fairgrounds outside Minneapolis, where three vendors had parked. They were in the big, traditional state-fair trailers, Ms. Lexvold said, with Hollywood bulbs and colorful flags, selling not just fries, but also ice cream, cheese curds and mini-doughnuts, fresh from the fryer. “People pulled chairs out of the back of their cars, and sat there and had a little picnic,” she said. “I thought, this is what it’s all about.” (State Fair To Go, a new business based in Minnetonka, Minn., ships boxes of Minnesota State Fair food within the continental United States. Each box costs $59.95 — with free shipping within the state — and contains six fair staples, including Elliott’s Up North corn dogs, Rosie’s French fries and Sweet Martha’s cookies. This week, the company began selling a $64.95 box of foods from the State Fair of Texas.) Stephanie Shimp couldn’t exactly tow around the Blue Barn, a fixture of the Minnesota State Fair — it’s a full-size barn that stands on the grounds year-round. In June, she took out a loan to buy and revamp a decommissioned grocery delivery truck. She held her first event, in a brewery parking lot, just one day after taking possession of the truck, and sold out of food in four hours. “It was kind of chaos,” said Ms. Shimp, 49. The Little Blue Food Truck now travels Minnesota selling the Blue Barn’s greatest hits. To make Nashville-style hot chicken on a stick, Ms. Shimp brines tenders in buttermilk spiced with cayenne, paprika and cumin, rolls the meat in cornflakes and deep-fries it, then serves it with pickles and a slice of white bread. Chicken in a waffle cone is Instagram catnip: a quilted cone layered with tenders and sausage gravy, sprinkled with chopped parsley and stabbed with a fork.
