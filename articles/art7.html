By Scott Cacciola Johnny Watson keeps an eye on the scoreboard clock whenever the Miami Heat are the home team — on paper, at least. Nothing is normal inside the N.B.A.’s bubble at Walt Disney World near Orlando, Fla., but the Heat can count on Watson for one familiarity: the sound of Michael Baiamonte, the team’s longtime public-address announcer, shouting, “Dos! Minutos!” whenever two minutes remain in a quarter. Watson cues up the audio recording of Baiamonte in his role as the primary game presentation director at AdventHealth Arena, one of the two gyms that the N.B.A. will use for its playoff games starting Monday. “Everything about this experience is surreal,” Watson, 41, said in a telephone interview. “But the players and coaches seem to appreciate all the little touches at the venue.” The 16 teams competing in the N.B.A. playoffs spent the season jockeying for position in standings that determine who has home-court advantage. But the N.B.A. bubble is a mostly depersonalized environment for athletic competition. If it were any more neutral, it would be in reverse. Even the Orlando Magic, who could Uber home, have been living out of suitcases ahead of their first-round series against the Milwaukee Bucks. That matchup, like all the rest, will be staged without fans, aside from the virtual ones that populate the wraparound video boards inside the arenas. But in striving to manufacture a home-court edge where none exists, the league — using people like Watson — has assembled a database of music, audio cues and graphics that teams would ordinarily be using in their own arenas. The idea, Watson said, is to create a sense of home, away from home. “As we get deeper into the playoffs, there will be more dramatic effects,” Watson said. “I think the spectacle will grow.” Even now, there are moments that transport teams like the Bucks back to their home arenas. From his spot at the plexiglass scorer’s table, Watson relays cues to his crew — he works with a public-address announcer, a music coordinator and a screens producer — to play the Notorious B.I.G.’s eponymous classic when Giannis Antetokounmpo soars for a dunk or to flash Khris Middleton’s name in flames on the arena’s big screens when he drills a 3-pointer.
