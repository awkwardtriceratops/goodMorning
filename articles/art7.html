Families and survivors who testified  this past week said his callous anti-Semitism was still hard to process. By Aurelien Breeden PARIS — It was a Friday afternoon, time for last-minute Shabbat shopping, and the Hyper Cacher — a kosher supermarket on the eastern edge of Paris — was busy. Yohan Cohen, 20, an employee, was working in the aisles. Philippe Braham, 45, was running errands from a list made by his wife. Yoav Hattab, 21, was looking for a bottle of wine. And François-Michel Saada, 63, was about to drop in for some bread. Hours later, on Jan. 9, 2015, all four were dead. They were killed by Amedy Coulibaly, a heavily armed Islamist extremist who took 17 other people hostage in the supermarket and claimed he had carried out the attack in the name of the Islamic State. “You are the two things I hate the most in the world,” Mr. Coulibaly told the hostages after bursting in, according to witnesses. “You are Jewish and French.” More than five years later, at a courthouse in northern Paris last week, survivors and families of the victims offered heart-wrenching testimony about the attack, which hit France just days after two brothers who had coordinated with Mr. Coulibaly massacred cartoonists and journalists at the offices of the satirical weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo. On Friday, two people were stabbed by a man with a knife near Charlie Hebdo’s former building. While the government has not stated publicly what motivated the suspect, an 18-year-old Pakistani, a French judicial official said Saturday that the man had blamed Charlie Hebdo and its publication of cartoons mocking the Prophet Muhammad. Tensions have resurfaced lately, with more than a dozen people on trial in the 2015 violence, many facing charges of aiding Mr. Coulibaly, who was killed after security forces stormed the grocery. Much like the survivors of the 2015 rampage at Charlie Hebdo, which the trial focused on earlier this month, the witnesses this past week told a breathless courtroom about their memories of the terrifying assault and how it left their personal lives in tatters. But Charlie Hebdo was targeted specifically over its printing of the satirical cartoons, and its staff members were wearily accustomed to menacing threats. Last week’s witnesses were grappling with a very different question: Why us? “Why the gratuitous malice?” Eric Cohen, Mr. Cohen’s father, asked the court. “Why this hatred of the Jew? I will never understand it.”
