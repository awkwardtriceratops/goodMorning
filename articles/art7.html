Rural America Faces New Worries With Postal Crisis<br></h1><p id="artcont">Rhiannon Hampson, right, fed chickens on her farm in Thomaston, Maine, on Thursday. Farmers and other rural residents say they are particularly vulnerable to the crisis roiling the postal system.Credit...Tristan Spinski for The New York Times Supported by By Jack Healy Rhiannon Hampson thought she would hear a cacophony of cheeping when she went to her post office in coastal Maine to fetch a delivery of newly hatched chicks. But the cardboard boxes addressed to her poultry farm were silent. “We could hear a few, very faint peeps,” Ms. Hampson said. “Out of 500, there were maybe 25 alive. They were staggering. It was terrible.” This is what happens when the mail suddenly becomes unreliable in rural towns and stretches of countryside where there are scant FedEx or UPS deliveries, and where people rely on the post office as an irreplaceable hub of commerce and connection. Now, with delays raising fears that the United States Postal Service is being hobbled by a combination of financial problems, politicization and pandemic, farmers and other rural residents say they are particularly vulnerable to the crisis roiling the postal system. And while President Trump’s own words have raised alarms that the problems are part of an effort to keep Democrats from voting by mail, many of those being hurt the most live in rural areas that overwhelmingly support the president. “This is an attack on a tried-and-true service that rural America depends on,” said Chris Gibbs, a farmer in western Ohio who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, but this year started an advocacy group arguing that the president has failed rural America. “It pulls one more piece of stability, predictability and reliability from rural America. People don’t like that.” Across the country, rural residents already have been affected in several ways. Checks and plant shipments are delayed, and tracking them down can take hours in rural towns without quick, reliable internet. Replacement parts for farm machines are late in coming. Prescription refills are taking a week or more to reach mailboxes, a particular threat because rural communities are older than most of America. On Native American reservations, among the country’s most remote places, families are driving five hours to get medicine and worry about being disenfranchised in November. Then there are the chicks. For decades, postal carriers have delivered day-old chicks, ducklings and all manner of plants and animals to small farmers and families with backyard hen houses. Industrial-scale farms have enough money to truck around their own animals or operate sprawling hatcheries. For everyone else, the mail is how the chickens come home to roost. Some chicks are getting lost in postal warehouses or spending days on trucks, farmers said. Others are getting smothered or crushed in the deluge of boxes created by America’s coronavirus-induced online ordering. One hatchery in Pennsylvania lost 3,000 chicks in a recent shipment. “We just don’t have any other options,” Ms. Hampson said. “There’s nothing sadder than seeing a box of tiny little fuzzy peeps and all of them are D.O.A.” Farmers said they were so afraid of losing more chicks in transit that they were driving hundreds of miles to pick up shipments from hatcheries. Ms. Hampson’s parents and in-laws Pony Expressed their way across Pennsylvania and New England to bring 15 boxes of just-hatched turkey poults to their farm. Other farms are telling customers not to expect products to come quickly. In Beech Island, S.C., Jenks Farmer, who ships two-pound lily bulbs across the country, has been getting bombarded with calls from anxious customers whose flowers had not arrived. He shipped one bulb to a customer in North Carolina, and a week later, the package was still stuck in Shreveport, La.
