Senate, Pressuring Cuomo<br></h1><p id="artcont">Democrats in New York bucked the national trend on down-ballot races, and could pursue progressive initiatives without fear of a veto. By Jesse McKinley ALBANY, N.Y. — Democrats lost seats in the House of Representatives. Dreams of Democratic pickups in the Senate were dashed in Maine, South Carolina and Iowa. And efforts to flip statehouses to Democratic control fell short across the map. But in New York, Democrats in Albany’s upper chamber have seemingly bucked that trend: The Senate majority leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, declared earlier this week that her conference had gained at least two seats, which would give Democrats 42 of the chamber’s 63 seats, enough for a supermajority. If the Democrats maintain their edge, it would change a postelection Day narrative: As Republicans built significant leads during in-person voting, some Democrats, including state party leaders, suggested that their core message had strayed too far to the left. But Democratic candidates won huge majorities of absentee ballots, mirroring the dynamic seen in several swing states in the presidential election. “We know that on election night, many people wrote us off, they said it was a big red wave, and they were already predicting our shrinking majority,” Ms. Stewart-Cousins said, speaking in the State Capitol. “The red wave turned out to be really more of a red mirage.” Some of the closest races have not been called by The Associated Press, even in contests where candidates have conceded, such as a high-profile race in the Hudson Valley involving Rob Astorino, a Republican who ran for governor in 2014. Mr. Astorino conceded on Tuesday to the Democratic incumbent, Senator Peter Harckham. If the Democratic victories hold, it would be a striking vindication for the Senate Democrats’ chief political strategist, Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, whose slate of candidates will have outperformed New York’s Democratic candidates in the House, where the party lost at least one seat, and is in danger of losing a second. More important, the Democrats’ wins may weaken Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s significant sway over the state’s budget and over major legislative initiatives. They may also enable the Legislature, already one of the nation’s most liberal, to pursue a range of new progressive-minded measures, including higher taxes on the wealthy without fear of a veto from the governor. Ms. Stewart-Cousins said that she believed that voters were won over by her party’s legislative accomplishments, including election reform, gun control, action on climate change and changes to rent laws. “The numbers prove that after the most productive legislation session in history, New Yorkers have not only chosen to return a Democratic majority, but, again, they’ve chosen to return a supermajority,” she said. With the State Assembly already dominated by Democrats, it remains to be seen just how much a legislative supermajority will change the dynamics in Albany. Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, is a fiscal centrist who has clashed with many of the Senate’s more progressive members, and who had worked closely with Republicans during his first two terms in office. Two days after the election, Mr. Cuomo said in a radio interview that “the Republicans beat the Democrats on the messaging,” by branding “Democrats as anti-law and order,” a characterization he disputed. On Monday, however, Mr. Cuomo downplayed any tension between himself and the Senate. “I worked very hard to get them elected,” he said, adding, “We’re all on the same agenda.” The governor also said that its members — drawn both from more liberal areas downstate, and more moderate areas elsewhere — were not monolithic. “There’s never going to be a situation where they have the entire Senate Democrats, all agreeing to the same thing and I’m opposing it,” Mr. Cuomo said, adding, “They have to represent their people otherwise they get into trouble as they learned in this past election.” It was not immediately clear what lesson the governor was referencing; while two first-term incumbent Democrats lost in swing districts in the suburbs of New York City, Ms. Stewart-Cousins’s conference picked up more seats in other areas, including in Buffalo, Rochester and the Capitol Region. Mr. Gianaris, who has clashed with Mr. Cuomo in the past, said that his members’ performance was no accident. They had seen an enormous increase in the absentee voters during June’s primary, after Mr. Cuomo expanded access to such ballots because of the coronavirus. They expected the same in November, particularly with President Trump on the ballot, and focused efforts on winning the mail-in ballot vote. They spent $2.2 million on digital campaigns, and sent more than one million pieces of mail to absentee voters, making a special effort to find what Mr. Gianaris called “low-turnout, Democratic-leaning voters who were at risk of not voting at all in 2020.” Voters who requested an absentee ballot, Mr. Gianaris said, were “called and texted multiple times” by campaign workers who gauged their level of enthusiasm for Democratic candidates, and encouraged them “to submit their ballots as soon as possible.” They also preached patience, promising that initial Republican leads would evaporate as absentees were counted. “Our campaign plan was built on a surge of absentee votes,” he said. “Some people didn’t see that coming, but we certainly did.” The Democrats, who won the Senate majority after a wave of progressive victories in 2018, had entered the 2020 election cycle with a large financial advantage over Republicans, who had hoped to recapture several seats on Long Island, running on a law-and-order platform against moderate incumbents. The Republicans’ effort was aided by a multimillion-dollar campaign from a political action committee, Safe Together New York, to try to defeat nearly a dozen Democrats statewide. That effort was backed by Ronald S. Lauder, the billionaire cosmetics heir and longtime supporter of conservative causes, who poured $4.5 million into the PAC. The Democrats were also helped by widespread retirements by veteran Republican senators, picking up several seats in upstate New York that had been held by popular incumbents. The loss of seats would be just the latest indignity for New York Republicans, who have not won a statewide race in nearly two decades. All four statewide offices — governor, lieutenant governor, comptroller and attorney general — are held by Democrats. New York’s natural tilt toward Democrats, who outnumber Republicans more than two to one in the state, will make Republican hopes of regaining the majority a steep challenge, and may complicate fund-raising efforts and recruiting candidates. The party’s leaders had made confident postelection predictions of gaining anywhere from four to six seats. Now, they are promising to fight another day. “If New Yorkers thought one-party control was bad, more Democrats in the New York State Senate will usher in a new era of radical, increasingly socialist policies,” Rob Ortt, the Senate minority leader, said in a statement this week. “Unlike anything before seen in this state.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
