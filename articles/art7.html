Speech<br></h1><p id="artcont">Michael Bloomberg’s appearance on the final night of the Democratic convention has reignited questions about his pledge to throw his fortune behind the effort to defeat President Trump. By Rebecca R. Ruiz Michael R. Bloomberg promised to spend big to defeat President Trump. Across a few short months, he put a billion dollars into his own bid for the Democratic nomination. Now, having dropped out in March after a skewering on the debate stage by Senator Elizabeth Warren and a lone electoral success in American Samoa, Mr. Bloomberg is preparing to step back into the political spotlight on Thursday with an address to the Democratic National Convention. The appearance, coming just before Joseph R. Biden Jr. will accept the party’s nomination, has stirred anger among some progressives as well as former Bloomberg campaign workers — and has reignited questions about the multibillionaire’s pledge to throw his fortune behind the general-election effort to defeat Mr. Trump. “He stiffed our party and all the monthly workers he promised to keep on through November,” Amy Siskind, a prominent progressive activist, wrote on Twitter. “Why is Bloomberg speaking?” In March, Mr. Bloomberg made an enormous $18 million transfer to the Democratic Party and offered up the leases to 13 field offices for the party’s use. Within weeks of exiting the race, he put $4.5 million into three major progressive groups — Swing Left, Collective Future and Voto Latino. But he has not given directly to Mr. Biden, whom he endorsed upon withdrawing from the race, and his termination of thousands of campaign workers who expected to be working through November in Mr. Biden’s name has inspired multiple lawsuits. “After spending a billion dollars on his own candidacy in the primary, many in the party thought that would imply spending at least as much on the general election, if not more,” said Eleanor Neff Powell, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a focus on money in politics. “A billion dollars may be an unreasonable expectation, but he set — and in some ways expanded — those expectations during the primary, even if he didn’t outright say how much he planned to spend in the general.” Former Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia, who served as national political chair of Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign, called the billionaire “a significant investor, but also a strategic investor,” pointing to his down-ballot donations and gifts to Democratic causes like Fair Fight, a voting rights group created by Stacey Abrams, the former candidate for governor of Georgia, to which Mr. Bloomberg gave $5 million late last year. This week, days ahead of his speech, Mr. Bloomberg announced that he would put another $50 million toward helping House Democrats, on top of $10 million he gave to the same cause late last year. “Mike has made it clear that he will increasingly be on the stage, and, on Thursday, literally,” Mr. Nutter said. “You’re seeing the re-emergence of the political Mike Bloomberg.” Mr. Bloomberg’s retreat from the national limelight came after bruising attacks by Ms. Warren, who challenged past remarks of his on redlining, a discriminatory housing practice, and highlighted his history of crude and sexist comments. Staff members and allies said he had spent the past five months focused on responding to the coronavirus, with his foundation putting more than $330 million toward fighting the pandemic. That included money for the introduction of New York State’s contact-tracing program, for which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo called him “extraordinarily helpful” in an emailed statement. Mr. Bloomberg has also put $35 million toward Hawkfish, a data and analytics operation that has contracts with the Democratic National Committee and Unite the Country, a pro-Biden super PAC permitted to accept unlimited contributions. His money has underwritten that digital venture, covering the firm’s operating costs as its staff conducts work for Democrats at market value, a spokeswoman said. In spite of his continued extensive philanthropy, his contributions have fallen short of what some in the party had thought he would spend — something Mr. Nutter likened to a message that had been garbled in a game of Telephone. “There’s no sane, rational person in politics who would say, ‘I’m going to spend “X” amount of money on a race,’” Mr. Nutter said, adding that much of Mr. Bloomberg’s influential giving around the 2018 midterm elections had come the month before Election Day. “He’s usually a later supporter, when we can really figure out the landscape.” Yet while “donors do like to hold their cards till the 11th hour,” said Dr. Powell, the political science professor, large gifts that arrive early can allow campaigns to make better strategic choices, especially this cycle. “Our normal election timeline really has to be shifted forward, given there’s going to be so much early voting,” she said. Some Bloomberg allies suggested that he had simply decided that Mr. Biden didn’t need his assistance, given the former vice president’s lead in the polls and the increasing strength of his fund-raising operation, which has at times outpaced Mr. Trump’s. Indeed, asked in January about his potential future support of the Democratic nominee — as he indicated a willingness to open his wallet to whomever the party chose — Mr. Bloomberg implied that he would calibrate his giving. “It depends whether the candidate needs help,” he said. “If they’re doing very well, they need less. If they’re not, they’ll need more.” Mr. Bloomberg’s transfer to the party in the spring went toward building out field operations in battleground states like Florida, Pennsylvania and Virginia earlier and faster than anticipated, though a party spokesman declined to specify how that money had been spent. “He’s continuing the work he’s done over several cycles to support our party, and coming out of the convention, he’s helping put Democrats in the strongest position possible to win at every level of the ballot in November,” said Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Stephanie Cutter, the convention’s program executive, said Mr. Biden wanted Mr. Bloomberg to speak specifically about the state of the economy. “Mayor Bloomberg worked with Joe Biden during the economic recovery 10 years ago and saw firsthand Biden’s ability to move the country out of this crisis,” Ms. Cutter said. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she had similarly valued his “chops to speak to both parties about the economy” when he addressed the 2016 convention. “And as a fellow New Yorker who had seen how Donald Trump operates for years, he was uniquely positioned to highlight his failings,” Mrs. Clinton said in a statement. But former campaign workers for Mr. Bloomberg this week likened Mr. Bloomberg to Mr. Trump, calling for Mr. Perez to remove their onetime boss from the convention program. They pointed to what they have called Mr. Bloomberg’s false promises to them of continued employment through the election. After the workers were terminated in March, publicly agitating about the prospect of going without health care during a pandemic, the campaign extended that coverage for them through November. “I’m an organizer by trade and I don’t want to have infighting, but he’s a problem, and he doesn’t actually hold the values that the D.N.C. supposedly expresses,” said Jane Conrad, a former field organizer for Mr. Bloomberg in Minnesota who is among more than 150 former workers involved in a proposed class-action lawsuit against him. Mr. Bloomberg’s team dismissed such criticisms and invoked his outsize support of the party, with a spokeswoman calling the calls for his removal from Thursday’s program distractions from the Democrats’ shared goal of defeating Mr. Trump.
