By Gail Collins and Bret Stephens Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every week. Bret Stephens: Well, Gail, it was another slow news week. Donald Trump and Joe Biden had a televised conversation and then the president caught some sort of cold. We’ll have to stick to boring subjects. The 25th Amendment, anyone? Gail Collins: We obviously want to begin by expressing heartfelt wishes for the president’s recovery. One of the goals of this election is reminding the world that this is not a country that believes a politician who’s terrible at his job should suffer physically. Bret: One hundred percent. Get well, Mr. President: We sincerely wish you good health, long life and the full use of your taste buds in order to savor electoral defeat. Gail: Last night, as I was trying to send positive thoughts toward the presidential sickroom, America’s most famous patient got in a car and rode around waving to supporters. I’m sure it cheered him up. But once again, not a great example to give everybody else. Of course it’s important for us all to wish him good health, but it’s impossible to ignore for one minute the fact that he spent the fall — and the debate a mere week ago — making fun of people who wear masks. Bret: I don’t want to get all karmic about this. Even a much more cautious president could have gotten sick; it’s part of the job description of the presidency to meet with a lot of people, and all it takes is one asymptomatic carrier to cause an infection. I’m not sure we’d have wanted Trump to go the Vladimir Putin route (he’s done that enough already) by requiring anyone who meets with him to first go into a two-week quarantine. Gail: Putin is happiest when he’s alone — and of course bare-chested — in an icy lake and Trump just wants to be surrounded by huge, hot masses of adoring fans. Bret: Well, we can sincerely thank Trump for not treating us to Putin-style photo-ops. The big question — hoping and assuming he survives — is what it means politically. And by the way, that’s a heckuva thing to have to say in the middle there.
