By Charlie Savage WASHINGTON — A Federal District Court judge may go forward with his plans to scrutinize the Justice Department’s request to drop the prosecution of President Trump’s former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn, an appeals court ruled on Monday. The ruling had been expected since the full court voted to erase an earlier split decision by a three-judge panel that had ordered the trial judge overseeing the case, Emmet G. Sullivan, to dismiss the case against Mr. Flynn without review. Questions at oral arguments earlier this month suggested that a majority of the court was inclined to let Judge Sullivan proceed.
