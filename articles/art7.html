Scott, The Times’s co-chief film critic, returns to the Book Review’s podcast this week to discuss the work of Joy Williams, the third subject in Scott’s essay series The Americans, about writers who give a sense of the country’s complex identity. Scott argues that Williams forces readers to see their surroundings anew. “She takes nothing for granted,” Scott says. “She defamiliarizes everything. So you might think, in a short story, ‘Oh, this takes place in New England in the winter, in Maine.’ But it doesn’t conform to any of your preconceived ideas about what that place and setting might be like. I think the same is true of ‘The Quick and the Dead,’ which takes place in Arizona. It’s not Barbara Kingsolver’s Arizona, it’s not the Southwest as we have thought about it through travel or through other reading. So every place that she comes to, it’s as if you’re there for the first time, and everything has to be described to you and conveyed to you in the most immediate and vivid and specific terms, because you’ve sort of dropped in from another planet and you need to get your bearings.”
