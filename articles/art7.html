On Feb. 11, they witnessed yet another world-record wave, this one ridden by the 33-year-old Brazilian Maya Gabeira, a surfer who almost lost her life to the same wave. Gabeira and her tow partner, Sebastian Steudtner of Germany, were in the lineup in Portugal to compete in the men’s team event at the Nazaré Tow Surfing Challenge. Gabeira, the only woman surfing in the men’s field, was in perfect position when the biggest set of the day rolled in. “I was in the zone,” she said this month from her home in Nazaré. “More brave than I am usually. I got really close to disaster.” Gabeira gripped the tow rope as Steudtner gunned their jet ski to 50 miles per hour, slinging her onto the lip of a cresting giant. She flew down the face of the wave as it curled overhead then crashed in a series of what felt like explosions, Gabeira said, before engulfing her body in white water. “I had never been so close to such a powerful explosion,” she said. “I had never felt that energy and that noise. It felt really terrifying.” This month, a team of private wave engineers and scientists with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of Southern California Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering determined the wave Gabeira rode that day was 73.5 feet, smashing her own previous record by more than five feet. It wasn’t just the biggest wave ever ridden by a woman. It was the biggest wave surfed by anyone during the 2019-20 winter season, a first for women in professional surfing.
