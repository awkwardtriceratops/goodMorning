Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Friday. Weather: Rain becomes heavy; the day starts in the 60s but cools quickly after midday. A mostly sunny weekend, with highs near 60. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Nov. 1 (All Saints Day). During the pandemic, business leaders in New York have been eager for one of their peers to run for mayor. Now, one of the highest-ranking and longest-serving Black executives on Wall Street has thrown his hat in the ring. On Thursday, that executive, Raymond J. McGuire, said he would be leaving his position as the vice chairman at Citigroup to join the growing field of candidates who are seeking the Democratic nomination next year. (City laws prevent Mayor Bil de Blasio from running for a third consecutive term in the November 2021 election.) Mr. McGuire is well known in the financial world, but as political newcomer he will need to make inroads with voters, according to my colleague, Jeffery C. Mays, who covers local politics. [Business leaders encouraged Mr. McGuire to seek the nomination, saying his background would help the city’s economic recovery.] To learn more about Mr. McGuire’s bid and what to expect from the race, I spoke with my colleague Emma G. Fitzsimmons, our City Hall bureau chief. Our interview has been edited lightly for brevity and clarity. Q: What are your thoughts on Mr. McGuire’s entry into the race? A: He seems like a really interesting candidate and could speak to voters who want someone with business experience and who want to elect the second Black mayor in the city’s history. After the Black Lives Matter protests this year, some Democrats believe the city doesn’t need another white man as mayor. But the progressive wing of the party also has a lot of power right now, and they might think Mr. McGuire is too conservative. They might be skeptical of him since he is an executive who has worked with big corporations. Who are a couple of front-runners in the race, and what are their visions for New York City? Two elected officials who are viewed as leading candidates are Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, and Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller. Mr. Adams did a “back to work” subway ride this week to urge New Yorkers to return to the system, and he’s Black and a former police officer, so he talks a lot about criminal justice issues. Mr. Stringer has been trying to establish himself as one of the most progressive candidates in the race, and he emphasizes his knowledge of fiscal matters.
