Even I Was Shocked by This Cronyism.<br></h1><p id="artcont">A privately owned entity created by the Export-Import Bank allows its customers to also be its owners. By Veronique de Rugy Ms. de Rugy is a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Right under the nose of a president who promised to drain the swamp, one of the government’s shadiest handouts to large banks and big companies looks like it will be renewed for another 25 years. It will not get adequate oversight and congressional review. All it will take is the approval of two out of three U.S. Export-Import Bank directors, who are political appointees. That entity is called the Private Export Funding Corporation, or PEFCO. I study corporate welfare, and even I was surprised to discover a government entity with such unchecked cronyism and self-dealing. How did it fly under the radar? Despite increasing taxpayers’ exposure to bank debt, it hasn’t received a public review since it made its first loan in 1971. At the urging of banking lobbyists, the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Uncle Sam’s credit agency that provides financing to encourage American exports) created PEFCO, a private entity owned by over two dozen banks and a handful of big corporations. It has operated under consecutive 25-year mandates with an exclusive arrangement, under special terms, to acquire Export-Import Bank loans from commercial lenders; because these loans are fully backed by taxpayers, they impart no risk for the banks that issue them. PEFCO’s current authorization expires at the end of December, but the chair of the board of the Export-Import Bank apparently believes there is a rush and wants a vote next week. It should not be renewed — and in the meantime, its cozy dealings with big banks and corporations deserve far greater scrutiny.
