By Kay Nolan and Michael D. Shear OSHKOSH, Wis. — President Trump questioned former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s mental capabilities and mocked Senator Kamala Harris of California as an extreme liberal in three campaign rally-like appearances on Monday as Democrats began their four-day national political convention nominally in Milwaukee but largely online. Standing in front of Air Force One in Wisconsin, a state that delivered 10 critical electoral votes for the president’s 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump warned that the 2020 election was a “fight for the survival of our nation and civilization itself” and condemned Mr. Biden as a puppet of the “radical left” in the Democratic Party. “You want to crush our economy,” Mr. Trump asked the crowd at the Oshkosh airport, “under the crazy socialist policies of Sleepy Joe Biden and his boss, Kamala Harris — Kamala — and his other boss, Nancy Pelosi — she’s a beauty — and his ruler, Bernie Sanders, Crazy Bernie, or do you want to quickly rebuild the strongest economy in the history of the world?”
