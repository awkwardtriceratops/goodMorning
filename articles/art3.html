They’ll blame China and make this into a burden visited on the president. Clinton is one of the few people making a policy-specific case for Biden’s election, talking about how he would move the country forward. Most speeches have focused on decency and humanity – Clinton and Sanders have stood out as focusing on policy. The lesson here is clear: If you want Bill Clinton to stick to his time allotment, it must be pre-taped. He puts it very plainly at the end: “It’s Trump’s us versus them America, against Joe Biden’s America.” May I interrupt this serious conversation to plug Curtis Sittenfeld’s “Rodham,” a wonderful novel of what happened after Hillary didn’t marry Bill. In 30 years, I’ve never heard Bill Clinton that succinct, or that short. Andddd here’s Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. We’re about to hear the nominating speeches. First up are the Bernie Sanders nominators: labor leader Bob King and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Tom Perez giving a speech that amounts to “we haven’t forgotten you, Wisconsin.” At live conventions the roll call is a great show – delegates in various state costumes, from cowboy hats to Hawaiian leis. Will miss that this year, I assume. I agree, Trip. The roll call is the point in the convention that should be in the convention center – and it’s going to seem somehow sad this way. This is the part that got pretty heated in 2016. Bennie Thompson is the dean of the Mississippi congressional delegation, its only Democrat, and its only Black member. Sanders’s decision to submit his name for nomination was a bit controversial. But his people say it is simple: He wanted to give his supporters a chance to vote for him, to show them that they still mattered. Here is Representative Ocasio-Cortez, speaking for Sanders. A.O.C. may have had a diminished role at this convention, but anyone who’s seen her speak in Congress or on the campaign trail for Sanders recognizes her big political talents. A.O.C. is speaking on tape from Washington. Definitely, Trip. A.O.C.‘s recent speech on the House floor, when she took on Representative Ted Yoho for his inappropriate comment, was remarkable. For her to get the word “colonization” in an approved tape seems striking, especially on a night on foreign policy. Here comes Jacquelyn, the New York Times elevator operator who endorsed Joe Biden while the paper’s editorial page did not. She turned out to be reflective of where the party was. Also a reminder of the before times, when people shared elevators. That was not filmed in front of the actual New York Times elevators. The nomination of Biden by a New York Times elevator operator was set up by a viral selfie they took last year when he stopped by the building. Senator Chris Coons is very close to Joe Biden and has been mentioned as a possible secretary of state during a Biden administration. As a 17-year-old, Coons campaigned for Ronald Reagan. Tonight is the time to give national exposure to the people who supported Biden from the jump: Rep. Blunt Rochester, Chris Coons, John Kerry, etc. Trump is aggressively tweeting throughout this, which is not surprising. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware is facing a not-insignificant primary challenge from his left this September. And now we have the roll call. First up: Alabama. That looks like the Pettus bridge in Selma. Alabama features a desperate Senate race this year for the Democratic incumbent, Doug Jones. He’s running against Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn football coach. Representative Terri Sewell spoke of the late Representative John Lewis and the Voting Rights Act. OK everybody, as the roll call starts, how do you think the first 45 minutes have gone so far? Reid, I thought the first part of the evening was rather mundane after last night. I missed the “regular” Americans in particular. For Alaska, Chuck Degnan, a veteran, fisherman, and party activist talks about climate change. American Samoa, whose caucuses were won by Mike Bloomberg! This roll call is all live so it could lead to some technical chaos. Arizona represents perhaps Democrats’ best opportunity to flip a Sun Belt state. OK, the roll call is the best part of the evening for my money. FWIW, the person watching this on TV in the other room in my home let out a yelp at these live roll call votes. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
