Herman Ms. Herman is a visual journalist and academic researcher. With the 2020 presidential election now upon us, Americans are still mired in uncertainty. But at least one thing has already been made clear: The women’s vote will be critical to the outcome. This past August marked the centennial celebration of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote. But as a researcher, I often find that historical events on the path to great accomplishments are largely overlooked. One such case: From April 6 to Sept. 30, 1916, Alice Snitzer Burke and Nell Richardson drove 10,000 miles, to make the case for women’s suffrage. The two women, sponsored by the National American Woman Suffrage Association, drove a donated yellow Saxon Roadster from New York City down the Eastern Seaboard, through the South, up the West Coast, and back east again. They met with Americans from every side of the issue, giving speeches in town squares, and debating suffrage skeptics on the sides of dusty roads. I used local newspaper archives to map their route. What emerges from these clippings is a picture of pioneering road trippers who look nothing like the dowdy suffragists depicted in most textbooks. At a time when car travel was still rare — and solo travel by women even rarer — these two set out armed with a typewriter and a sewing machine. “If any anti-suffragist down in Texas makes remarks about suffrage destroying women’s feminine talents,” they told a reporter, “it will be Miss Richardson’s cue to get out the sewing machine and run off an apron while the crowd waits. If, on the other hand, he says women have no brains, she will pull out the typewriter and write him a poem.” Cars were viewed as men’s machines, laborious to operate. Burke and Richardson relied on AAA’s Blue Book for directions, and braved the elements in the roofless Saxon. In Mobile, Ala., they were given a black cat to accompany them on their journey. They named him Saxon and sneaked him into hotels each night. For the first two months of the trip, Burke wrote a regular column in The New York Tribune recounting their days and journey. The excerpts include tales of a close encounter with a mule; their adventures navigating undrivable roads; narrowly avoiding mobilizing troops in the Southern states and encountering soldiers who autographed the Golden Flyer.
