Now They’re Behind on Rent.<br></h1><p id="artcont">THE NEEDIEST CASES FUND For these families in Queens, bills piled up. “All this hit and it’s hard because you feel so powerless over everything.” By Emily Palmer The last day Maria Quezada saw her husband alive, he was lying in a hospital bed in Nassau County, his face bloodied after 17 days of intubation. “His face, that’s what hurt me most, seeing how he had been hurting so long — how he suffered,” she recalled in Spanish. “I will never forget his precious face.” Covered in protective gear, Ms. Quezada, who had recently had Covid-19, reached for his hands. They already felt cold. Donate now to the 109th annual campaign of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. All proceeds go to 10 organizations providing assistance to those facing economic hardship.

About 30 minutes after leaving, she received a call from the hospital: Her husband, Gerardo Campos, had died. In the days that followed, she recalled in a recent interview, “I didn’t even know where I was.” When Mr. Campos died in April, Ms. Quezada, 53, who makes minimum wage working part time as a crossing guard at a public school, was left alone to support two daughters and an infant granddaughter. Already a month behind on rent and unable to pay again in May, she owed $3,300 for her apartment and had fallen $650 behind on gas and electric bills. In this year of economic struggles during the pandemic, as many as 40 percent of New Yorkers were unable to make rent in April, even with the $600-a-week supplement to unemployment benefits in effect (they expired in July). Working as a mechanic, Mr. Campos had covered most of his family’s expenses, among them: $1,650 monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment and $160 a month for gas and electricity. Central Queens, made up of compact immigrant enclaves like the neighborhood of Corona where Ms. Quezada lives, was among the hardest hit in New York by Covid-19, with more than 7,000 cases in the first few weeks of the outbreak. Although New York had halted evictions, the family feared falling further behind and losing their apartment. So, Ms. Quezada’s daughter Kimberly Carrion, 21, turned to Commonpoint Queens, a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation of New York, and one of 10 organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
