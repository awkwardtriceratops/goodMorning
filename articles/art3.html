By Bryan Pietsch Several boats sank at an event promoted as a Trump Boat Parade on Lake Travis in Texas on Saturday, the authorities said. The Sheriff’s Office in Travis County received “multiple” calls of boats in distress starting at 12:15 p.m. local time, a spokeswoman, Kristen Dark, said. She said “several” boats sank but it was not clear how many. There was no immediate word on casualties. Exactly what happened as well as the number of boats participating in the gathering was not immediately clear, she said. The “Lake Travis Trump Boat Parade” was organized on Facebook. Owners of boats of “all shapes and sizes” were encouraged to participate and to decorate them with “as many Trump flags as she can handle,” the page said. Boaters were set to travel around the lake, which is about 15 miles northwest of Austin, at 10 miles per hour, according to the event’s Facebook page. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
