By Maria Cramer Aaron Coleman admitted that he harassed girls online when he was in middle school. He called one sixth-grade girl fat and told her she should kill herself. Seven years ago, he told another girl, who was 13 at the time, that he would circulate a naked photo of her if she didn’t send him more nude images. When she refused, she said, he followed through on his threat. “They’re accurate,” Mr. Coleman, 19, said of the women’s claims. On Monday, Mr. Coleman, a dishwasher and community college student, was declared the winner of a Democratic primary for a seat in the Kansas House of Representatives, defeating the incumbent, Stan Frownfelter, by 14 votes. The final count was 823 to 809. What would have been a story about a young upstart taking down a seven-term incumbent during a period of nationwide youth activism has instead alarmed Democratic state leaders, who said they were worried that Mr. Coleman’s acknowledgment of his troubled past and other comments he made during the campaign would hurt their party's chances in competitive races. Democrats had been making inroads in Kansas, a state long dominated by Republicans, and hoped to capture enough seats in the Legislature to break the Republicans’ super majority. Mr. Coleman is not facing a Republican opponent but Democratic leaders, including Gov. Laura Kelly, have said they are supporting Mr. Frownfelter, who announced on Tuesday that he would run as a write-in candidate in the general election against Mr. Coleman. “Aaron Coleman is not fit to serve in the Legislature,” said Lauren Fitzgerald, a spokeswoman for Ms. Kelly. Tom Sawyer, the Democratic House minority leader, said he did not believe most voters in the 37th district, in Wyandotte County, knew about Mr. Coleman’s past. The party plans to campaign hard on behalf of Mr. Frownfelter, he said. “I hope he can pull it out so I don’t have to deal with this kid,” Mr. Sawyer said. Mr. Coleman, who has apologized for the way he treated the women, said the party should accept the will of primary voters, who supported his platform of a single-payer health care system, fighting climate change and legalizing cannabis. “We need and we deserve someone who will stand up for those policies and I’m the only one in the race who will do it, and that’s why I’m the only one on the ballot,” he said in an interview. “When you pay so little attention to your district that you lose to a 19-year-old with no political connections, it probably means you should retire.” Mr. Coleman ran for governor as an independent when he was 17, before a law was passed setting an age requirement for candidates seeking that office. Candidates running for governor must now be at least 25. Mr. Coleman declined to comment on the claims of the women and referred to statements he gave to The Associated Press and The Kansas City Star, which detailed the women’s accounts. The women could not be reached for comment on Mr. Coleman’s behavior or his primary win. One of the women, who is now 18, said on Facebook that she attempted suicide after Mr. Coleman repeatedly attacked her over her physical appearance when she was in the sixth grade. Another woman said she was furious when he followed through on a threat to circulate a naked photograph of her after she refused to give him any more nude pictures of herself. The woman, Kati Hampton, now 20, of Kansas City, Kan., said in an interview that she did not know Mr. Coleman at the time and believed he found her through Snapchat. “I just don’t think he needs to be in a powerful position considering what he’s done to girls,” Ms. Hampton said. She added, “It’s good that he admitted to what he did.” A third woman said on Facebook that Mr. Coleman harassed her and would relentlessly call her at home until she picked up the phone. Faith Rivera, an activist in Wyandotte County and a member of the county’s parks and recreation board, said she learned of the posts in June through her 19-year-old daughter, who saw them online. The Aug. 4 primary was less than two months away and Ms. Rivera said she believed voters needed to know about the women’s posts. She said state Democrats were paying little attention to the race, which Mr. Frownfelter was widely expected to win in a reliably Democratic district. But Ms. Rivera, who saw how hard Mr. Coleman was campaigning, was worried and tried to spread word of the women’s posts on social media. “We blasted it as much as we could,” she said. After the polls closed on the day of the primary, Mr. Coleman held a five-vote lead. By Monday, after county officials finished counting provisional and mail-in ballots, his lead had grown to 14 votes. “His win to me is a setback for these victims,” Ms. Rivera said. “It’s a setback for anybody who stood up and said this is not right.” Ms. Rivera said she believed voters were impressed by Mr. Coleman’s charisma and his promises to create change in a county where many voters are tired of established politicians. On Facebook, he has touted himself as a progressive candidate who espouses the values of Senator Bernie Sanders, and he has posted pictures and videos of himself at Black Lives Matter rallies. “He knocked on doors,” Ms. Rivera said. “He canvassed his heart out and Wyandotte County is so ready for a change.” During the campaign, he mocked Republicans who did not wear masks and said he would “giggle” if a former Republican legislator died of the coronavirus. Mr. Sawyer, the state House minority leader, speculated that such comments may have played well with some voters who saw Mr. Coleman as a maverick unafraid to speak his mind. In a statement, Mr. Frownfelter said voters did not know enough about Mr. Coleman when they cast their ballots for him. The final tally represented roughly 6 percent of registered voters in the district, according to Mr. Frownfelter’s campaign. “It was easy for him to have quick conversations with voters, trying to get their vote, without revealing this dark side of him that we see now so clearly,” Mr. Frownfelter said. “This is why I encourage every voter to truly educate themselves on the candidates before casting their ballot and to get out there and vote. Every single vote matters.” Mr. Coleman said he did not foresee himself becoming a career politician. He said his goal was to transfer to the University of Kansas and join the Air Force R.O.T.C. program. For now, he said he planned to continue campaigning through the general election and win the seat. “If people want to focus on the opera show, they can do that,” he said of his critics. “But I’m focusing on the issues affecting voters and working-class Kansans.”
