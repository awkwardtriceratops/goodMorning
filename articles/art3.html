Our Luck Just Ran Out.<br></h1><p id="artcont">The men and women of the military are essential workers, too. By Esau McCaulley Contributing Opinion Writer When I met the woman who would become my wife, it was 2001, we were in college, and she already knew that she wanted to join the military. The Navy would pay for her medical school, freeing her of debt. Military service was not a part of my plans, but love makes fools of us all. Since my wooing was already on shaky ground, I smiled and said, “That sounds great.” I knew then that if we started dating, I would be beginning a relationship with the military as well. We’ve been married 15 years. The first seven years of our marriage were taken up with active-duty service. About 16 percent of Naval officers are women, and about half of them are married. That has made me something of an anomaly: the male spouse of an officer. I remember showing up at the first “moms and tots” meeting with my son and thinking, “Well, this is awkward.” Still, we were lucky: My wife never deployed during her years of active duty. Despite three moves, our marriage remained strong. She then transitioned to the reserves, which took her away from me and our four children for a manageable one weekend per month and two weeks every summer. It took a pandemic for our luck to run out. A month ago, my wife came home from her time in the field with the dreaded news. As a part of dealing with the unexpected complexities of Covid-19, she, like many other reservist doctors, had been called up to active duty. She would soon have to depart for seven months. In a moment, our anniversary, the start of school, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Eve were all transformed. Military families all over the world get this news every day. Deployments are always difficult, but preparing for one in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, when everything else feels so unsteady, is a particular challenge. My wife and I prayed a lot about this — why us, and why now? We concluded that our sacrifice is small compared with the sacrifices of others, and that we need not understand what God is doing in order to trust him. Nonetheless, we mourned the separation. Two of our children were at camp when we got the news. I was supposed to leave town to teach a weeklong intensive course. This spring and summer had been a difficult one for the children, with online classes, online church, extended isolation and racial upheaval. How would they handle the added stress of an absent parent? How would I handle teaching at a college with its own combination of in-person and remote teaching while helping the kids, who would not be in school full time? Beyond that, my wife and I have been a team and have worked through life together the past decade and a half. How would I manage so long without her? As unsettling as this deployment is for our family, we are not alone: Among those in active duty, about 15 percent are deployed at any given time. In the military community, there is always someone who is going through or who has been through what is happening to you. When I called one of my good friends, who is a reservist, to tell him the news, he told me that he, too, had been called up active duty and would be gone for even longer than my wife. The community knows how to rally around families during a deployment, offering meals, babysitting and emotional support. The community came through for us as we prepared for my wife’s deployment: They provided welcome insights, prayer and counsel. They reminded us that my wife has a “good deployment.” It is not dangerous or overly long by military standards. But her job is complicated. Being a doctor in the military is always about balancing the health of your patients with the needs of the military. It is the job of the doctor to advocate for the emotional and physical well-being of servicemen and servicewomen, even when they deeply desire to get back to duty. This is all the more true in the midst of a pandemic. Many of the symptoms of Covid-19 could also be the common cold, allergies or fatigue. My wife and other doctors are figuring out who to test and when, as they work with a population that must live and work in close quarters. They must balance mission readiness with proper caution. When we think of essential workers, our minds turn to grocery stores and medical offices and hospitals here in the United States. We talk about the important roles played by teachers and members of the clergy. But the military is another part of our society that cannot be shut down because of a virus. Although I will miss my wife, I am proud of the role that she will play in helping others. She is a part of something bigger than herself, offering her skills to a community of people who sacrifice for our country. She is not naïve or unaware of the troubling things that have occurred in this country’s past. She’s dedicated not merely to a set of abstract ideals, but also to the people she serves. She is deploying in the middle of a pandemic, but there are also young men and women who signed up to serve in the middle of that same pandemic. Some will be newly minted high school graduates making their first forays into adulthood. They deserve the best medical care that their country can provide. When our two oldest children returned home from camp, we ordered their favorite pizza. We sat them down and told them that their mother would be leaving soon. We thought that if we told them about the return date instead of the length of the absence it would be better. But despite all the planning, we couldn’t protect them from a profound sense of loss and sadness. The younger two, who are 4 and 6 years old, don’t have a good grasp of time; they don’t understand how long she will be gone. The older two got it. They hugged her tight and fought back tears. I thought back to that dorm conversation all those years ago. I remembered that I signed up for all of this, the good and the bad. My wife isn’t the only one who serves. We all do.
