But she didn’t get to the Supreme Court by letting other people tell her what she could do. By Emily Bazelon When I met Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the first time in 2008, she took me to see a political cartoon that hung in a hallway outside her chambers at the Supreme Court. The cartoon depicted Belva Lockwood, a lawyer in her 50s, who was the first woman to argue a case before the court, in 1880. Ginsburg noted that the Supreme Court bar initially refused to admit Lockwood several years earlier. In response, Lockwood drafted and lobbied for a bill, which Congress passed, allowing qualified women attorneys to practice in federal court. When Ginsburg began law school at Harvard in 1956, she confronted the barriers of her own era, including queries from the dean about why she felt entitled to take a man’s spot in her class. Ginsburg’s commitment to her studies and later her work, and her conviction that other women had the same drive and capability, became the animating principles of her career. The timing of Ginsburg’s death on Friday at 87, from complications of a recurrence of pancreatic cancer, and President Trump’s determination to quickly confirm a successor, have prompted a gnawing question among many liberals: Why didn’t Ginsburg resign years earlier, when President Barack Obama could have named a nominee for her seat? Ginsburg’s love for what she called her “good job” — serving as a Supreme Court justice — and her focus on the representation of women help explain her decision to stay. The epic political battle over confirmation could affect the results of the November election and change the trajectory of American law for decades. Ginsburg didn’t think women should get to do what men did because she believed they would do the job better; she wanted equality for its own liberating sake. Litigating at the Supreme Court in the 1970s, she helped achieve a series of victories that helped free women and men and transgender people from the confines of narrow, gender-based expectations. In 1973, arguing before the Supreme Court for the first time in the case Frontiero v. Richardson, Ginsburg persuaded the nine male justices to strike down a military regulation that prevented husbands of women in the military from receiving the same benefits as the wives of male soldiers. “Nearly a century had elapsed since the Court first heard a woman’s voice at counsel lectern,” she wrote in a foreword to a 2007 biography of Lockwood, connecting her own appearance at the high court to Lockwood’s pioneering one. When I interviewed Ginsburg in her chambers in the summer of 2009, the nomination of Justice Sonia Sotomayor was pending. “I feel great that I don’t have to be the lone woman around this place,” Ginsburg said, anticipating Sotomayor’s confirmation. Being on the court without Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, who resigned in 2006, was like going back to being one of only nine women in her law-school class, she said. “Every time you went to answer a question, you were answering for your entire sex. It may not have been true, but certainly you felt that way. You were different and the object of curiosity.” She talked wistfully about Canada, where Beverly McLachlin was then the chief justice and surrounded by at least three other female colleagues. “I think they must have a different way of hearing a woman’s voice if she is the leader,” Ginsburg said. By then, Ginsburg was in her mid-70s. She had surgery for pancreatic cancer in 2009 (she was also treated for colon cancer a decade earlier). She fended off questions from journalists about when she would retire by noting that she was appointed to the court at the same age — 60 — as Louis Brandeis, nominated by President Woodrow Wilson in 1916. Brandeis served for 22 years, until he was 82; Ginsburg would say she intended to stay at least as long. At the time, O’Connor was talking publicly about her regrets about the conservative turn the court began to take after her departure. O’Connor decided to leave the court when she was 75 because her husband was sick with Alzheimer’s. But soon after she left the bench, his illness progressed to the point that he could no longer recognize her. She told her biographer, Evan Thomas, that retiring was “the biggest mistake, the dumbest thing I ever did.” “I think O’Connor’s departure served as something of a cautionary tale for Justice Ginsburg,” remembers David Newman, one of Ginsburg’s clerks in 2010-11 and now a lawyer at the firm Morrison & Foerster. “She still had a lot she wanted to see accomplished.” It was important to Ginsburg to be on the court to welcome Sotomayor and, a year later, Justice Elena Kagan. “She had a lot to give them as new justices,” her friend Judith Resnik, a Yale law professor, told me over the weekend. “She understood completely the centrality of critical mass.” In 2010, Ginsburg’s husband, Martin Ginsburg, died after his own battle with cancer, and her focus on her work at the court became even more consuming. “Her life revolved around love of her work,” Newman remembers. “If you had a camera trained on her 24/7 the year I was a clerk, you would have seen her during almost all her waking hours reading, writing, editing, giving speeches — immersed in the law and the craft of judging.” A few years later, when Ginsburg was in her early 80s and President Barack Obama was in his second term, calls for her to retire sounded mostly from male academics and writers. But Ginsburg by then had new celebrity status as the Notorious R.B.G.; in 2013, Shana Knizhnik, then a law student, started a Tumblr by that name to honor Ginsburg’s memorable dissent in the voting-rights case Shelby County v. Holder. In that case, Ginsburg compared the majority’s decision to stop requiring states and counties with a history of racial discrimination to get the approval of the Department of Justice before changing local voting rules, for example by closing polling places, to “throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.”
