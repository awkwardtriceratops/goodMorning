An ancient firm by internet standards, Amazon has grown like a medieval city, still defined by its distinctive old center but made a true megalopolis by vast sprawl. It has modernized substantially, but its basic features are still intact — and being used well beyond their imagined limits. Take Amazon’s review system. Some of the site’s most prolific reviewers have been rating products on the same five-star scale for more than 20 years, and occasionally, their messages from the distant past surface on product pages. A customer browsing books about sailing might encounter a review written by Jeff Bezos himself in 2001, recommending one title as “intense and disciplined.” (Thirty-four people have found this review “helpful” since then.) In the 1990s, Amazon reviews were both functional and, as a concept, anti-establishment: What if anyone could be a book reviewer? Then: What if anyone could do what Consumer Reports does? Then: What if anyone could review pretty much anything, for any reason at all? The rating system has adapted to encompass reviews of shoes, cosmetics, athletic gear, medical equipment, TV shows, software, musical instruments and furniture. A more recent undertaking, however, is proving difficult: What can an Amazon review tell us about fresh food? “Taste like an onion, did the job,” reads one recent review of a piece of produce. Another went further: “Tastes good.” Not everyone reviewing Amazon’s “Yellow Onion (Brands May Vary)” gave it five stars, however. Ninety customers have rated the Yellow Onion as deserving just one. “They went bad too fast,” one reviewer warned. “Moldy and decaying, rotten outer layers,” another wrote.
