By Noam Scheiber Like a vintage LeBron James dunk, the pro basketball labor stoppage was remarkable both for its display of strength and for the speed with which it ended. The episode halted the National Basketball Association playoffs for three days, with games resuming Saturday, and in many ways it illustrates a paradox of today’s labor activism: In a winner-take-all economy, only the stars can reliably exert leverage in the workplace. But the fact that they are winners, with enormous paydays at stake, can also make them cautious. “Right now, for the first time in my experience with professional sports, the players have the attention of the owners,” said B.J. Armstrong, a player agent who was a guard for the Chicago Bulls when the team won three championships. “But if the players don’t play, what is going to happen? I think the players understand economically what that would do to them.” It is a pattern that extends far beyond professional sports. In the fall of 2018, highly paid Google engineers joined a walkout of some 20,000 workers to protest various workplace frustrations and revelations that a senior executive received $90 million after a colleague accused him of sexual misconduct. The company made modest concessions, such as ending forced arbitration for employees who raised complaints of sexual harassment or assault. Then many of the engineers who walked out sought a return to business as usual, and organizers began to find themselves isolated within a few months. Several activists left the company and some were eventually fired. (Google has said they were dismissed because they violated company policies, not because of their activism.) In April 2019, thousands of Hollywood writers fired their agents at the urging of their union, which claimed that the major talent agencies siphoned off revenue through deals they negotiated with studios that should go to the writers. Many prominent Hollywood creators supported the action initially, but over time some of them voiced doubts about the union’s strategy. This year, amid concerns from some top writers who also work as showrunners, the union dropped a tentative proposal that studios work only with agencies that the union had agreed on terms with. According to The Los Angeles Times, the showrunners, who have more extensive financial links to the major agencies, did not believe they could staff their productions without the agents. The union has since reached deals with dozens of agencies, including two of the top four. “It’s been the solidarity of the membership that’s made this campaign successful,” said Neal Sacharow, a union spokesman. Like workers in these other spheres, the N.B.A. players quickly discovered that they had the power to disrupt a major industry — a power that ordinary workers have gradually lost over the years, as rates of unionization have fallen and companies have outsourced jobs. “I’ve never seen a day like that, that tested our entire league,” Lloyd Pierce, the coach of the Atlanta Hawks, said in an interview. “That power is tremendous. The opportunity is tremendous.” But it also underscored to the players that the economic fallout would land heavily on them. “If we do well, they do well,” Tilman Fertitta, owner of the Houston Rockets, told CNBC. “And if the league doesn’t do well, none of us do well. And they realize that.” Like Silicon Valley engineers and Hollywood showrunners, many of today’s N.B.A. players aren’t so easily classified as “labor.” They are often one-man industrial complexes with interests spanning the globe that make them workers and owners. Many players have shoe lines and invest in technology start-ups, sports franchises, media businesses or production companies. “When I came into this world, it was the basketball business,” Mr. Armstrong said, alluding to an era when at most one player, his former teammate Michael Jordan, had become an industry unto himself. “Suddenly, it’s turned into the business of basketball.” In some respects, this gives the biggest stars more economic independence from their teams and the league, and therefore more leverage. “LeBron’s brand extends far beyond the court,” said Amira Rose Davis, an expert on sports and labor history at Pennsylvania State University. “If he’s told to shut up and dribble, he turns around and does a three-part documentary.”
