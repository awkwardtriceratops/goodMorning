By Christina Caron It’s inevitable. In the fall and winter your child is likely to develop a fever, runny nose or cough. Maybe even all three. In past years, that probably wouldn’t have been so worrisome. Usually children are sent back to school as soon as they are well enough to attend. But now parents are bound to wonder: Are those symptoms a sign of Covid-19? Should my child stay home? Does she need to be tested? If so, how often? The rules at different schools may vary. With cold and flu season quickly approaching and the school year already underway in many states, parents need to know what to do. So we asked three pediatricians if it’s possible to know whether your child’s symptoms might be Covid-19, and how to proceed if you think your child has the disease. You likely won’t. Because the symptoms of Covid-19 mimic so many other typical childhood illnesses, it’s really hard to tell. “Unfortunately, there is no one very distinguishing feature,” said Eva Cheung, M.D., a pediatric cardiologist and critical care specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital and Columbia University Medical Center.
