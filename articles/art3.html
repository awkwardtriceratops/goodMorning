By Michael Gold At noon on Wednesday, the first day in months that New York City’s restaurants were allowed to resume indoor dining, Aroma Brazil in Queens had only three diners inside — hardly a crowd. But for the owner, Sydney Costa, even three people was cause for celebration. The return of indoor dining is a major step forward in New York’s recovery and a critical moment for a restaurant industry that has been struggling for months in the face of a pandemic that devastated it. But it remains to be seen if limited indoor dining will be enough to help keep struggling restaurants afloat. When the coronavirus swept into New York, Mr. Costa’s restaurant closed for three months. In June, he reopened for outdoor dining only to learn that eating at tables on bustling Roosevelt Avenue was not popular with his customers. So Mr. Costa, who has laid off 12 employees and no longer draws a paycheck, desperately hoped the return of indoor dining, however limited, might boost his bottom line. “It’s make or break right now,” he said. Yet the delight among restaurant owners was also marked by trepidation over whether customers would feel either safe or economically stable enough to return. Restaurateurs also worried that state-imposed limits would further eat away at profits, and that a recent uptick in virus cases in parts of Brooklyn and Queens could bring a resurgence that might prompt another lockdown.
