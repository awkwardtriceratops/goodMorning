By Remy Tumin and Merrill D. Oliver (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The U.S. is heading into Labor Day weekend averaging about 40,000 new cases per day, down from a horrifying peak in late July. But in many ways, the country is worse off now than at the beginning of summer: On Memorial Day weekend, the U.S. averaged 22,000 cases a day. The two holidays bookend a summer of lost opportunity. The U.S. failed to stamp out the virus before the fall, which is expected to bring new dangers with the start of school, flu season and cooler weather that will drive people indoors. The earlier summer spike was blamed, in part, on Memorial Day gatherings. If you plan to get together with friends and family in the coming days, here’s how to do it safely. 2. The U.S. added 1.4 million jobs in August as employers brought back workers, but at a slower pace than in the spring. Millions of Americans remain out of work. Above, a job center in Pearl, Miss. The unemployment rate fell significantly to 8.4 percent. But an increasing number of people reported that they had lost their jobs permanently, rather than being temporarily laid off or furloughed — a sign that the crisis is doing lasting damage. The slowdown spans many industries, but the service economy is especially hurting. As companies reconsider their long-term need to have employees on site, low-wage workers that depend on office-based businesses stand to lose the most. 3. President Trump is under fire amid allegations that he referred to American soldiers killed, wounded, and captured in combat as “losers” and “suckers,” according to The Atlantic. The remarks could be problematic for Mr. Trump because he is counting on strong support among the military in the general election. The president heatedly denied making the comments. “I’ve done more for the military than almost anybody else,” he said. A visibly angry Joe Biden called the remarks “disgusting,” and said that, if true, the comments would make Mr. Trump unfit to lead. Mr. Biden’s son Beau Biden served in Iraq. 4. We’re following several law enforcement developments around the country. In New York, the mayor of Rochester and senior state officials faced escalating questions about why more than five months passed before action was taken in the death of Daniel Prude. Mr. Prude, who was having a psychotic episode, suffocated after he was detained and hooded in March. Protesters took to the street overnight. In Lacey, Wash., agents shot and killed an antifa supporter as they moved to arrest him on Thursday night. Michael Forest Reinoehl was being investigated in last week’s killing of a right-wing activist in Portland, Ore. In an interview with Vice News, Mr. Reinoehl appeared to admit to the shooting, and said he believed he had acted in self-defense. And Mississippi dropped charges against Curtis Flowers, a Black man tried six times for the same killings. The prosecutor, who was white, was found to have excluded Black jurors. 5. Researchers are starting to pinpoint the ways in which smoking and vaping are a risk factor for catching the virus, and how they may give rise to some of Covid-19’s worst respiratory symptoms.
