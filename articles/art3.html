Democrats of False Advertising<br></h1><p id="artcont">Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren say that their images were improperly used on a flier that they view as an attack on the Working Families Party. By Jesse McKinley ALBANY, N.Y. — Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren entered an unexpected clash on Tuesday with New York Democratic leaders over the fate of a progressive third party. The dispute stems from a political flier paid for by the state party featuring Joseph R. Biden Jr., his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, and Senators Warren and Sanders, all smiling and pleading with New Yorkers to vote “Democratic — all the way!” But Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders said they were not consulted about the flier, and had they been, they would not have consented to the ad, which pushes voters to cast ballots on the Democratic Party line. Both senators support the Biden-Harris ticket, but want ballots cast for the candidates on the Working Families Party line, which has backed them in the past. Mr. Sanders accused the state Democratic Party, which is effectively controlled by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, of trying to sabotage the Working Families Party. “It is absolutely unacceptable for the New York Democratic Party, which just a few short months ago supported canceling the presidential primary, to now use my image in a push to punish the Working Families Party,” Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont, said in a statement. “They never asked my permission and I wouldn’t have given it if they had,” he said. “I believe New Yorkers should vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the Working Families Party line.” That sentiment was echoed by Kristen Orthman, a spokeswoman for Ms. Warren, who said the Massachusetts senator “didn’t approve this ad” and asked that digital versions of it “be taken down.” Under state law, candidates in New York can collect votes on several different party lines, a system known as fusion voting. But under a new law adopted this year, political parties in New York have to earn 130,000 votes — or 2 percent of the total vote — every two years in order to automatically retain their ballot lines. Parties that do not reach that threshold would have to petition for their candidates to appear. State Democratic officials acknowledged that they did not seek permission from either senator, or the Biden ticket, to use their images, but defended the $357,000 campaign, which also included digital advertisements using images of Senators Warren and Sanders. “My interaction with them is none,” said Jay Jacobs, the chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee and a longtime ally of Mr. Cuomo’s. “The entire piece simply speaks to voting for Democrats up and down the ballot.” “My job is to get voters out to vote on the Democratic line,” he added. “And there’s nothing wrong with that.”
