For Trump, the October Surprise Never Came.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Trump’s hope that an economic recovery, a Covid vaccine or a Biden scandal could shake up the race faded with the last light of October. By Shane Goldmacher and Adam Nagourney President Trump began the fall campaign rooting for, and trying to orchestrate, a last-minute surprise that would vault him ahead of Joseph R. Biden Jr. A coronavirus vaccine. A dramatic economic rebound. A blockbuster Justice Department investigation. A grievous misstep by a rival he portrayed as faltering. A scandal involving Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. But as the campaign nears an end, and with most national and battleground-state polls showing Mr. Trump struggling, the cavalry of an October surprise that helped him overtake Hillary Clinton in 2016 has not arrived. That has left Mr. Trump running on a record of an out-of-control pandemic, an economy staggered by disease, and questions about his own style and conduct that have made him a polarizing figure. Some events that flashed across the political landscape gave Mr. Trump’s political circle hope for a lift: an opening on the Supreme Court, street protests that the president sought to blame on Democrats and even his three-day hospitalization with the coronavirus, which some advisers had hoped might make him more empathetic. None of it appears to have made a difference. If anything, the come-and-go nature of what seemed like earth-moving moments underlined the central and fundamentally stable dynamics of the race. Opinions about Mr. Trump are largely set. More than anything, the race was defined by the pandemic that exploded into the public consciousness in March and that Mr. Trump has struggled to manage as both a health care and a political issue. The nation experienced a new spike in daily infections — almost 100,000 on Friday — as infections jumped in particular across the Midwest. “State nears shortage of ICU beds,” the banner headline in The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel warned on the eve of Mr. Trump’s visit to the battleground state of Wisconsin on Friday. The spiraling of bad news about the pandemic overwhelmed a glimmer of good economic news for the White House: a record increase in third-quarter economic growth. “The October surprise happened in March,” said Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist who managed the 2008 presidential bid for Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is now one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers. Jennifer Palmieri, a top adviser to Mrs. Clinton in 2016, said that “the underlying factors of life in America right now are so dramatic in and of themselves” that the idea that the race could be transformed by a news event, as happened with Mrs. Clinton in 2016, had always seemed like a long shot. “A pandemic, an economic downturn,” she said. “People decided a long time ago which side they were on. In the end, October was not surprising. Not this year.” Mr. Trump can still win on his own. He could repeat his 2016 Electoral College victory by turning out white blue-collar supporters who typically do not vote in large numbers and whom many pollsters undercounted last time. But the hurdle is higher. That improbable victory was the result of not only his resonant appeal to Americans alienated from the political establishment but also of events that rocked the final weeks of the campaign. But Mr. Biden is not Mrs. Clinton. She did not have a reservoir of good will to help her overcome the rush of damaging news in the final weeks — in particular, the last-minute on-again, off-again investigation of her emails by James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I. By contrast, Mr. Trump survived even after the release of an audiotape — in October, of course — in which he was heard boasting of how he had grabbed women by the genitals without their consent. While polls in 2016 showed that many voters were choosing between two candidates they did not like, this time around, Mr. Biden is viewed favorably in many battleground states. There is a history of October (or September) developments that upend the best planning of a candidate. Sometimes events happen that are beyond the control of either side, such as the last-minute release of a video message by Osama bin Laden in 2004. It was widely seen as giving a late boost to President George W. Bush, who had anchored his campaign against John F. Kerry with warnings about a potential reprise of the attacks of Sept. 11. But often it is a campaign dropping negative information about an opponent that is timed to occur when voters are paying the most attention.  In mid-October, The New York Post published an article suggesting improper foreign business dealings by Hunter Biden, based on questionable information provided by Mr. Giuliani reportedly from a computer hard drive — which Mr. Giuliani claimed belonged to the younger Mr. Biden — that had been left at a Delaware repair shop. The article captured attention in the conservative news media but didn’t appear to alter the race.
