Victoria Azarenka did, too, but not before a rain delay. “I’m going to get frozen,” she said. By Christopher Clarey and Karen Crouse Sunday’s first-round match was certainly not the French Open debut that Coco Gauff envisaged when she won the junior girls title in the sunshine here in 2018 at age 14. Instead of playing to a full house and springtime breezes, Gauff faced Johanna Konta in late September on a 10,000-seat show court that was all but empty of spectators amid a persistent drizzle and chilly winds. But despite the nasty weather and her 12 double faults, Gauff found a way to stay upbeat and get the better of yet another elder, defeating the ninth-seeded Konta 6-3, 6-3 in Gauff’s first main-draw match at Roland Garros. “Being a Floridian, basically we have one week of winter, and this is what it is,” Gauff said. At 16, Gauff, the phenom from Delray Beach, has already won a singles match at all four of the Grand Slam tournaments, and her resilience on Sunday was an apt metaphor for the French Open as a whole. Postponed for four months because of the coronavirus pandemic, it was a struggle to make this event happen at all. Though temperatures were genuinely balmy last week in Paris, they were more suited to the deck of a North Atlantic fishing trawler on opening day. Tights and long sleeves were de rigueur and some stars opted for even sturdier gear. Venus Williams, the 40-year-old American veteran, entered the Simonne Mathieu Court wearing a puffy winter jacket with the hood pulled up. She proceeded to play — and lose — her first-round match to Anna Karolina Schmiedlova while wearing a visor when a wool watchcap might have been more appropriate. Victoria Azarenka, a finalist at the United States Open just two weeks ago, walked on court to face Danka Kovinic and then insisted on walking off with her opponent less than 30 minutes later.
