By Michael Levenson A wide receiver who was cut from the New York Jets on Tuesday has been charged with fraudulently obtaining a $1.2 million loan from the Paycheck Protection Program and using the proceeds to buy luxury goods, prosecutors said on Thursday. The former player, Joshua J. Bellamy, 31, was charged with wire fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, prosecutors said. He was arrested on Thursday morning and made an initial appearance via Zoom in federal court in Florida. Mr. Bellamy, of St. Petersburg, Fla., signed with the Jets in 2019 but was sidelined with a shoulder injury in March after playing in seven games. He was cut from the team on Tuesday, according to a Jets spokesman. He had played for the Chicago Bears from 2014 to 2018. In a federal complaint, prosecutors said that Mr. Bellamy had taken part in a scheme with 10 other defendants who collectively filed at least 90 fraudulent loan applications seeking more than $24 million in coronavirus relief loans. Many of those loan applications were approved and funded by financial institutions, paying out at least $17.4 million, prosecutors said. Mr. Bellamy became involved, prosecutors said, after Phillip J. Augustin, who was described in court documents as a manager for professional football players, used falsified documents to obtain a fraudulent loan for his talent management company, Clear Vision Music Group L.L.C. Mr. Augustin, seeking kickbacks, then began to work with Mr. Bellamy and others to submit numerous other fraudulent loan applications, prosecutors said. Federal prosecutors said Mr. Augustin had collected more than $900,000 in kickbacks. Mr. Augustin, 51, of Coral Springs, Fla., was charged in July with wire fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, and obstruction. Prosecutors said Mr. Bellamy had obtained a Paycheck Protection Program loan of $1.25 million for his own company, Drip Entertainment L.L.C., which he used to buy more than $104,000 in luxury goods from Dior, Gucci and other merchants. Mr. Bellamy also spent $62,774 in loan proceeds at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, prosecutors said. Diego Weiner, Mr. Bellamy’s lawyer, said it was “very early in the case, and Mr. Bellamy is presumed innocent.”
