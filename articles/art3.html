By Rachel L. Harris and Lisa Tarchak Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants. Did Thursday’s debate — the final for this election — change anyone’s mind about who should lead the country? Opinion’s political writers have shared their thoughts and we’ve asked readers to do the same. On the whole, they found the evening’s proceedings far more palatable than the first matchup between President Trump and Joe Biden: “This debate was almost watchable,” wrote Emily Smith, a reader in Seattle. “Who won? The moderator.” But there was disagreement as to who was the more persuasive orator. “Trump’s attack on Biden’s statement about oil and gas was the first effective outreach to traditional conservatives that I have seen during the election,” wrote Robby O’Neil in Austin, Texas. On the other hand, Simeon Atha in Columbus, Ohio, found Biden’s promise to wind down the oil industry inspiring. “As a young person, it’s really encouraging to hear that there’s hope I’ll have a healthy planet to live on,” he wrote. Who succeeded in the ultimate mission to win over undecided voters? “The mere fact that Trump was able to appear even semi-presidential could constitute a huge win for him,” wrote Grace Nevins in New York. David Brown in St. Louis agreed: “It was a relatively neutral debate, which I believe ends up being a win for Trump. He may have stopped hemorrhaging swing voters.” Donald Stone in Middleton, Wis., thought Biden’s performance was a win for all Americans. “This was the best debate I’ve ever seen because it showed the clearest difference between candidates,” he wrote. “If Biden loses this election, it won’t be his fault. It will mean that America is smaller than he believed it to be.” More analysis from our readers follows. Their comments have been edited for length and clarity. Arezu Riahi, Boston: As much as it pains me to say it, Trump. He has a way with these catchphrases that stick in the heads of voters on the fence: “Forty plus years and you didn’t do anything,” “You got nothing done,” “You built the cages” — which are mostly falsehoods, but I can’t remember anything Biden said to prove as much. Eduelle Jan Macababbad, the Philippines: It was a tie. President Trump successfully challenged the credentials of his opponent. Former Vice President Biden went on the offensive as he scrutinized his opponent’s records. I personally believe that while this debate won’t mean anything, they have fundamentally represented their beliefs — and those of their parties — in a striking manner. The energy, perseverance and motivation of both candidates were on full display tonight. David Anthony Diggs, Victorville, Calif.: Biden. All of his responses were couched in policy and coherent thought. Trump’s responses all had one wing dipped in unfounded conspiracy and the other in flat-out made-up facts and figures. Plus, Trump still hasn’t remotely recognized the 200,000-plus Covid deaths that deserve far more than being ignored as “it is what it is.” R. Kathleen Dillon, Brooklyn, N.Y.: Biden missed some zingers — that pollution is down because of Obama and that opportunity zones have been misused by the wealthy. He should’ve hit harder about the G.O.P. Senate having stymied actions he and Obama wanted. I think Trump won back a few of his base but anyone who is current with the news knows Biden told the truth while Trump dissimulated, equivocated and didn’t address the issues. Carroll McDonald, Baraboo, Wis.: Joe Biden won, although he faced a much better opponent in the second round of debate. For that reason, it’s a slimmer win. Both Biden and Trump got in their licks but Trump’s tended to be personal attacks against Biden while Biden’s were about issues that Americans care about such as the coronavirus, racial issues and health care. Kevin Coyne, Atlanta: From the perspective of a relatively uninformed undecided voter who does not care to check out facts, Biden won by a little. From the perspective of one who compares assertions to facts, Biden won by a lot. From the perspective of what each had to accomplish (with Trump down by eight points and this being the final opportunity for him to speak to a large number of undecideds), it was essential for Trump’s performance to be outstanding. As per above, it was less than 50/50. That’s a disaster. Mike Lethby, Littlehampton, England: I think Trump was much more measured than in the first debate, as he needed to be. Biden did not seem to me to be as potent and hard hitting as he could have been. In short, the debate offered a softer view of both candidates, which probably will not change many minds in the U.S. electorate.
