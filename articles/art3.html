Then Came a Highway, and an S.U.V.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Kim McCoy lost her leg in a horrific accident during an ultramarathon across the Deep South. After 270 miles, should runners have had to cross a four-lane highway? By Matthew Futterman Kim McCoy remembers the porch of the Alabama church where, exhausted from running all day, she grabbed an hour or so of sleep before dawn on that late June day. It was the day she should have died. There were dead bugs everywhere on that porch, but there was also a decent, open bathroom with carpeting at the church, a luxury for someone nearly 270 miles and five days into a 340-mile ultramarathon across the Deep South. Sleep came easy. Then dawn approached, and it was time to hunt down breakfast at a nearby gas station and begin the final, 70-mile push to the finish. She remembers little else from her run that morning. What she next remembers is waking up in a hospital bed and seeing four intravenous lines emerging from her arm. As a labor and delivery nurse at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, she knew four I.V.s were a bad sign. “I think I knew at that point that I had lost my leg,” McCoy, 37, said in a recent interview. She does not remember the impact with the S.U.V. that sent her flying more than 100 feet down the four-lane highway in northern Alabama, about 30 miles southeast of Huntsville. Thomas Grinovich does. A fellow participant in the race, he was trying to cross Highway 72 with McCoy. One moment, he said, McCoy was close to his left shoulder, halfway across the dark, wide roadway. The next, a headlight, the roar of an engine, then a horrific, pounding thud. “When I get the flashbacks,” he said, “that sound is what I hear.” On June 18, McCoy and Grinovich were among the 66 runners who set off from West Memphis, Ark., for the inaugural running of the Heart of the South Road Race, the brainchild of Gary Cantrell, known in the ultrarunning world as Lazarus Lake. Since the mid-1980s, Cantrell, a bearded, Camel-smoking ultrarunner from Tennessee, has been creating some of the world’s toughest events. His competitions are more journeys than races, ones many runners never finish. In the past three decades, only 15 people have completed Cantrell’s Barkley Marathons, a 100-mile venture over unmarked terrain in the Cumberland Mountains in eastern Tennessee. As ultrarunning — any race longer than a 26.2-mile marathon — has become more popular, the sport’s hard-core practitioners have pushed the limits of the sport and human endurance. Races that stretch more than 200 miles over several days are no longer uncommon. Catastrophic injuries and collisions with cars are rare in ultrarunning, though the sensation of dodging death — from exposure, exhaustion, dehydration or even an encounter with a bear, a mountain lion, a rattle snake or speeding traffic — can be a part of the appeal. But McCoy’s accident, crossing a highway after five endless days of running, raises the question of whether this race was a test of rigor or recklessness. Cantrell created the Heart of the South Road Race because he felt his signature event, the Vol State race across Tennessee, a 300-mile journey from Missouri to Georgia, had become too easy, with spectators along the familiar course offering runners nourishment and places to rest. Heart of the South runners, who had to acquire food and water along the way and carry those items in lightweight backpacks along with extra clothes and a small blanket, didn’t get a map or warnings about the route from West Memphis, Ark., to Castle Rock, Ga., until hours before the race. In a recent interview, Cantrell said he spent months thinking about, designing and researching the route, searching for roads that met his safety standards, had plenty of opportunities for food and water, and included some history. He had set up the course to roughly follow the Lee Highway — Highway 72, in that region — and to honor DeWayne Satterfield, an elite ultrarunner from Huntsville who died of cancer at 55 in March. He did not seek permits for the race, which in some states can require race organizers to install warning signs at hazardous crossings, because, he said, pedestrians are allowed on all the roads, including at that T-intersection on Highway 72 without any traffic signals. Cantrell said there was a stretch that was “really bad,” on the busy roads west of Huntsville, but the crossing where McCoy was hit was not on that bad stretch. Candice Burt, an organizer of ultramarathons, including the Tahoe 200 Endurance Run around Lake Tahoe, which crosses major highways but uses signs required by the permits she gets, said that after several days without sleep, runners can lose the ability to gauge how quickly a car might be approaching.
