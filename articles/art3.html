As it stands, the East Coast is slated to see her somewhere deep in the 10 p.m. hour. I was just thinking about that, Matt. I feel like hard-core Democrats will eat this up. It’s designed to hit all their buttons. And that’s a major audience for a convention. The parties want to energize their volunteers, get money in, etc. A text from a Dem strategist: “Is anyone still watching who doesn’t have to watch for their job?” The convention polling bounce has become much less of a thing in recent years, in part because the country is so polarized. So why not use the time to motivate supporters and fund-raise? A little “My City of Ruins” tease at the end there, so we did get our second Springsteen already, Grynbaum. It was going to be a miss without “My City of Ruins.” Just got a text from the Biden campaign asking if I will “join Tom Hanks and me tomorrow” for a grass-roots fund-raiser. Folks, worth noting that Fox News is airing a regular episode of “Hannity” right now. Karl Rove is talking about the post office. And the Democratic convention has been relegated to a miniature picture-in-picture in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Fleg, a Democrat in Pittsburgh texted me unprompted to answer to your question: “I’m definitely still watching — because I want to! The fast pace is working for me.” So the Democrats in the first half hour of this event are going heavy on regular people – both as narrators of the country’s problems and validators for wayward Republicans who may be looking for permission to vote for Mr. Biden. And Muriel Bowser, apparently. Jenny, Dem strategists don’t always get it right! Ask Presidents John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. Muriel Bowser, the mayor of D.C., is standing in front of D.C.’s Black Lives Matter Plaza – right before we hear from George Floyd’s family speaking live from Houston. Just as the convention kicked off tonight, Sean Hannity was starting his Fox News monologue: “It will be the most boring, repetitive, dull, mean-spirited convention in history.” Eva Longoria’s introduction was airing beside him onscreen, muted. While Fox has Hannity going live right now, both CNN and MSNBC are carrying the stream still uninterrupted. Mayor Bowser got a lot of points out in a short time. It’s striking to hear Kamala Harris called “sister” by two other Black women already. It underscores the historic first of her candidacy. Nick, CBS News’s livestream has actually cut away for analysis. The anchors John Dickerson and Norah O'Donnell are leading a discussion as the Dems’ pretaped segments air on cable news. That felt like the first big “moment” of this event – 30 seconds of silence on TV backed by a montage of Americans with their eyes closed. I can’t remember anything like that on television before. That was the first time I really felt stopped and brought into the broadcast, Reid. The silence was as powerful as any montage. Do we know if this is live or pretaped? It still jarring to me to see how band members have to socially distance for (possibly recorded) live performances. Lisa, I was just wondering the same. It’s clearly a prerecorded video, but CNN and MSNBC both have the “live” bug in the corner of their screens. The networks need to figure out a way to tell viewers which parts of this convention are happening in real-time. We can solve this – Jenny, how’s the light right now in L.A.? Golden and perfect like in that performance? Lisa, you stole the words from my keyboard — the golden light is exactly right at this moment in L.A. Back to the seriousness: I agree with Nick that the moment of silence was very powerful and an important reminder of what so many people took to the streets for this summer. A reader in Ohio texts to say that even PBS has cut away to offer analysis. Notable so far: not a ton of discussion of Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. But a couple videos of him talking. OK, this sounds silly, but I feel like I’m kind of surprised when Biden pops up. It’s like, oh yeah, this is about Joe Biden. That is likely by design. The Democrats have been trying to turn the protest energy into voting power. While the November impact remains unknown, there was a noticeable surge in voter registration in states across the country during the first week of protests after George Floyd’s death. Guys, what do we think about how the first 30 minutes has gone? It has, if nothing else, been a very efficient ensemble. Many faces, many moving parts. First 30 minutes went by fast, Reid. Is anyone else surprised to see Biden running this segment? Seems like a heavy “live” presence for the nominee early in the convention. It’s amazing how different this is from what we have seen at the beginning of a normal national political convention. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
