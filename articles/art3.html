Teens When Their Parents Reject Them<br></h1><p id="artcont">Over a third of young people in foster care in New York City identify as L.G.B.T.Q. and are struggling to find the support they need, according to a new survey. By Amanda Rosa A teenage girl from Brooklyn bounced to four foster homes before she trusted a family enough to come out as bisexual. In Queens, a 21-year-old transgender man said he no longer spoke to his parents. Another teenager, who is transgender, remembered the day he climbed to the roof of his apartment building in Queens and contemplated jumping to his death. Soon after, he was placed into a foster home. Some advocacy groups have long believed that gay, bisexual and transgender teenagers are overrepresented in the city’s foster care system, and that many struggle to find support in it and at home. A new survey has confirmed that impression: It found that more than a third of New York City’s young people in foster care identify as L.G.B.T.Q. The survey, published on Tuesday by the Administration for Children’s Services, the city’s child welfare agency, revealed disparities between the L.G.B.T.Q. youths and their peers in foster care. The young people who identify as L.G.B.T.Q. are placed more often in group homes or residential care, instead of family-based homes. They also are more likely to report experiencing homelessness, negative interactions with the police, and feelings of depression and hopelessness. The agency said it had used the survey’s findings to develop a plan to decrease the number of L.G.B.T.Q. youths in the system, increase placements with relatives and foster families, and improve the young people’s overall well-being. In New York City, children can stay in foster care into adulthood, transitioning once they find stable housing. “Without that data, in a sense, we’re doing program and policy planning in the dark,” said David Hansell, the agency’s commissioner. “We can only do good planning to meet the needs of youth in foster care if we really understand what those needs are.” For years, foster care agencies in New York City have lacked the data to assess L.G.B.T.Q. youths’ needs or analyze their own shortcomings. Nationwide data on L.G.B.T.Q. teenagers in foster care is scarce. While there is no federal data for comparison, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a philanthropy for underprivileged children, has found that about 24 percent of young people being served by a foster care initiative it has in 17 states identify as L.G.B.T.Q. The New York City survey is “a very targeted focus on a population that we usually don’t see in child welfare,” said Sandra Gasca-Gonzalez, vice president of the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s Center for Systems Innovation. Theo Sandfort, a professor at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, analyzed the findings of the telephone survey, which was completed in late 2019. People ages 13 to 20 who were in foster care answered questions about their gender, sexual orientation, demographics, experiences in the system and well-being. Nearly 2,400 people were contacted, and 659 responded. About 34 percent of the respondents said they were L.G.B.T.Q. While some children are placed into foster care because of abuse, neglect or poverty, many L.G.B.T.Q. teenagers enter the system after their families reject them. Jonathan DeJesus, the 21-year-old man who said he no longer speaks to his parents, dreams of becoming a public speaker and an advocate for young people like him. Mr. DeJesus said he was first placed in foster care when he was 12, after experiencing domestic violence at home. Despite family therapy, friction continued once he identified as a lesbian. “I started to dress masculine and everything, so it was just definitely out of the question for them,” he said, referring to his parents. His first placement, at a residential treatment center in Westchester County, N.Y., was supposed to last a couple of months. Mr. DeJesus stayed for four years. His experience was similar to that of other L.G.B.T.Q. youths who lingered in residential care and group homes. Mr. DeJesus said he was thriving in his current group home because it was L.G.B.T.Q. specific and aided in his transition. Under the child welfare agency’s new plan, all staff members must attend two days of training. The agency will also recruit foster parents interested in caring for L.G.B.T.Q. youths, and L.G.B.T.Q. youths will join a current youth leadership council that advises the staff. While the plan outlines solutions, the survey does not get to the root of the disparities. It does not, for example, explain why L.G.B.T.Q. youths are more likely to have more placements or more likely to be placed in group homes. Family settings tend to be more effective, Ms. Gasca-Gonzalez said, because “families take care of each other’s needs” and group homes typically have generalized rules.
