By Joe Coscarelli For as long as Donald J. Trump has been a brand name — representing playboy bling and New York business savvy in the 1990s up through his freestyle approach to presidential politics today — he has flirted with hip-hop. Sometimes, famous rappers reciprocate. Yet even for a man who once palled around Manhattan nightclubs with Puff Daddy and Russell Simmons, and later hosted Kanye West in the Oval Office, President Trump can still surprise with his Black celebrity alliances, judging by the reaction on Thursday night to a photo op with Lil Wayne. “Just had a great meeting with @realdonaldtrump,” the multiplatinum rapper posted to his nearly 35 million followers on Twitter after the two posed together in Florida, earning a retweet from the president. “He listened to what we had to say today and assured he will and can get it done.” Just had a great meeting with @realdonaldtrump @potus besides what he’s done so far with criminal reform, the platinum plan is going to give the community real ownership. He listened to what we had to say today and assured he will and can get it done. 🤙🏾 pic.twitter.com/Q9c5k1yMWf The photo immediately went viral on social media, but the backlash was swift as well, making Lil Wayne the latest in a recent line of rappers to align themselves, however briefly, with the president’s re-election campaign, only to face criticism from fans and fellow artists. Lil Wayne, like Ice Cube before him, had cited the president’s Platinum Plan, a two-page document rolled out in September that promised to “increase access to capital in Black communities by almost $500 billion” over the next four years.
