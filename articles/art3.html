It’s Not Trumpism.<br></h1><p id="artcont">When Republicans jettison liberty as a core political value, they reject conservatism and America itself. By Samuel Goldman Mr. Goldman is the author of the forthcoming book “After Nationalism.” Republicans gathered last week for their election pitch, but the convention did not settle a rancorous debate among activists and thinkers about what it means to be conservatives and where they fit in the political world today. From the 1960s to the election of Donald Trump, the American right was largely defined by “fusionism” — a complementary mix of morality (pushed by traditionalists) and political freedom (supported by individualists, or libertarians). But Mr. Trump’s victory changed that. A growing number of religious conservatives (like Patrick Deneen) and economic nationalists (like Oren Cass) argue that libertarian influences should be expunged. Their criticisms are not entirely unjustified. After the Cold War, a version of 1980s conservatism was endlessly abstracted into a set of empty repeated slogans — often called “Zombie Reaganism” — that applied 1980s solutions to 21st-century problems. Yet fusionism is much more than an outdated policy checklist. It’s an approach to politics that avoids authoritarianism and pessimism. It needs to be adapted to meet 21st-century challenges, but conservatives should not dismiss one of our best resources.
