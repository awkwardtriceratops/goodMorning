By Daniel E. Higgins and Sharon Otterman BUFFALO, N.Y. — Over the past month, the number of coronavirus cases has increased tenfold in the upstate city of Buffalo and its surrounding suburbs. Hospitalizations already have surpassed the levels seen in the spring. And the Covid-19 hotline for Erie County, where Buffalo is situated, is getting “annihilated,” the health commissioner said, with 1,500 calls in one 24-hour period this week. “The second wave is here, and it is here with a vengeance,” Mark Poloncarz, the county executive, said at a news conference, urging residents to take the surge seriously. Western New York, a bustling five-county region of some 1.4 million people along the Canadian border, has emerged as the biggest trouble spot of the state’s second coronavirus wave. If New York City was the hot spot of the spring, then this area seems to presently have that distinction. Normally known for its neighborliness, its Buffalo Bills football team and its namesake spicy chicken wings, the region now gets regular criticism from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo for its average positive test rate, which has remained around 5 percent for two weeks. By the numbers alone, the Buffalo area already meets the benchmarks for the harshest restrictions available to the state — the closing of nonessential businesses and the banning of public gatherings — yet officials have held off. But as the cases continue to rise, that designation seems almost inevitable. “We’re watching the numbers,” Mr. Cuomo said on Wednesday. “We’re going to watch through this Thanksgiving season.” The rise in Erie County has been a more extreme version of what is happening statewide, and more so resembles the uptick in other regions of the country. Since mid-October, the number of cases in the county has gone from 322 per week to 3,449 per week. Hospitalizations have risen from 84 on Nov. 10 to 264 on Nov. 23. While hospitals have sufficient beds for now, county officials said, staff is being stretched thin. The St. Joseph Campus Hospital, part of the region’s Catholic Health hospital system, has returned to being a coronavirus-only hospital as it was in the spring, with its emergency department temporarily closed. Intensive care admissions are increasing at a slower rate, because of improvements in care, though 40 people have already died of the virus in November, bringing the total coronavirus fatalities in the county to 788 people.
