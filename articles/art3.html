By Kathleen Gray WEST BLOOMFIELD, Mich. — When Gov. Gretchen Whitmer joined Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign in early March as a national co-chair, she was prepared to help him in the rigorous search for a running mate. Then, after gaining national recognition for her deft leadership in her state of Michigan during the coronavirus crisis, as well as her frequent criticism of the president’s pandemic response, she got a call from Mr. Biden and underwent the rigors of being vetted herself. Her turn in the spotlight would flash and fade over the next four months, as she faced attacks for her coronavirus policies from President Trump, right-wing protesters and Michigan Republican lawmakers. But early this month, Ms. Whitmer shot to the top tier of candidates once again as word leaked that she had flown to Delaware to meet personally with the Bidens. While Mr. Biden eventually chose Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, Ms. Whitmer will still play an outsize role in the campaign as the Democratic leader of a key battleground state crucial to Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016. With a margin of 10,704 votes over Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate since 1988 to win Michigan. Ahead of her speech on Monday night to the Democratic National Convention, Ms. Whitmer spoke to The Times about the V.P. vetting process, the challenges of campaigning during a pandemic and a strategy for turning Michigan back to blue in a presidential election. This interview has been edited and condensed. Q. When did the idea of you possibly being on the Democratic ticket first start to take shape? A. He called me in early April and asked me to go through a vetting and I was really stunned, to be honest. I thought I was going to be one of the people helping him vet and find a running mate. And, of course, I said, yes. I had moments through the process where I did have reservations and I asked to be taken out of consideration when the dams broke. [In May, two dams in mid-Michigan collapsed, draining two lakes and sending devastating flood waters through the cities of Sanford and Midland.] I shared that my focus needs to be 100 percent here. I also thought that he should consider a running mate who adds diversity to the ticket. They asked me to sleep on it and call him back and he’d like me to stay in it. I slept on it and I called him back. I said, if you think I can help you, I will do whatever it is you think I can do to be helpful. And so I stayed in the process. And, you know, I’m glad I did. I had a lot of opportunity to talk with the former vice president about Michigan and what really mattered and what our experience has been with Covid. When and how did you find out that Kamala Harris had gotten the V.P. nod? I got the text message from the Biden campaign like everyone else. But I had talked with the vice president earlier in the day. He called and we had a great conversation. And I’ll be honest, I’ve told him throughout the process that I have my dream job. At the end of the day, I think one of the best outcomes is he’s got a partner and Michigan will have two new best friends in the White House, and that’ll be good for our state. What was the vetting process like? As you would expect, intensive questions and background research and a thorough vetting. Was it intrusive? Oh yeah. A number of people were involved and we all signed confidentiality agreements, just so that we could move quickly and respond and make sure we had all information that was requested, everything from 20 years of tax returns, the personal, political, all sorts of questions that span a variety of issues over a lifetime. And how was the meeting with him in Delaware? Did you get a sense then that you were still in the upper tier of candidates? Yeah. We had a lovely meeting, Dr. Jill Biden and the former vice president and me, and it was just an opportunity to talk about the vision for the country and the potential for what a relationship might look like. I reiterated every step of the way that, you know, I am enthusiastic and supportive of him, and whoever is a part of his administration. If Biden wins and offers you a cabinet position, would you accept? I truly want to stay here in Michigan. Anyone who knows me, knows I’ve never been drawn to run for a federal office because I want to be right here in my home state. I’ve got three generations of family here. And so I would have a hard time imagining that there would be something that would lure me to Washington D.C. That’s just who I am. Not even a run for president? Like I said, I’ve never been drawn to Washington D.C. But I care so much about this country. I care about where we’re headed. And I’ve learned to never say never. But to be honest, it’s not something I could imagine. It’s going to be very difficult to campaign this year. How important is it for Michiganders to see Kamala Harris or Joe Biden here in Michigan this year? I know they understand how important the state of Michigan is, not just for the election, but to our national economy. What’s going on in Michigan is a reflection of what’s going on across the country. And so I’ve got a high level of confidence that the Biden-Harris ticket will be spending a lot of energy and focus on the state of Michigan, not just in an election, but after an election if they’re successful. Do you think that Michiganders want to see them in person? We all want to see one another in person and yet, we know that in the midst of this pandemic, we’ve got to be really smart. It’s incredibly important that leaders model the behavior and follow accurate scientific counsel to keep ourselves and one another safe. And so we will stay connected, but just in a different way. So no big rallies in Michigan for the Biden campaign? I’m hopeful that there’re no big rallies anywhere for any campaign. That’s not a political statement. It’s just simply acknowledging that we’ve got to follow the science. You’re speaking Monday night during the Democratic National Convention — where will you be speaking from and what’s your message? I will be speaking from [United Auto Workers] Local 652 in Lansing, Michigan, and my message will be about our front-line workers who have kept the rest of us safe throughout this pandemic. It will be a call to unity. What are you telling Joe Biden about Michigan, Michiganders and how to win the state? It was so close in 2016. How do you switch that up? So we won overwhelmingly in 2018. We had historic turnout and won by almost 10 points. I would anticipate in November we’ll have a higher turnout. I’m concerned about all of the maneuvering that’s going on with the United States Postal Service. I’m worried that the Trump administration is undermining the election. And so I’m working very closely with the [Michigan] secretary of state and attorney general to make sure that we do everything we can to get every vote in and counted. When you called Joe Biden, telling him you were thinking about withdrawing, what was his initial reaction other than to sleep on it? Why do you think he really wanted to keep you in the mix? You know, we have built a great relationship. And I think we are cut from a similar cloth in a lot of ways. And having picked a running mate of my own, I know how important it is to have someone who you have confidence in their competency, and also in the fact that you have similar values and see the world the same way and that they’re going to have your back. And I have to imagine that’s what he saw in all of the women who were in the final stages of vetting. I’m confident that’s exactly what he sees in Kamala Harris. You said that you and Joe Biden are cut from the same cloth. What do you mean by that? When he came to campaign with me, we were in a diner in metropolitan Detroit. I love to be in the mix. I thought maybe I was one of the people that loves it the most and then he came in, he loved it even more than I do. You are wary of the polls that are out there. What’s your prediction? I hate making predictions. I know that things are going to tighten up, and they always do. Putting Michigan into a category where it’s such a big lead, I think is hugely troubling because I don’t want anyone to believe that. I’ve seen polls where it’s single digits and others where it’s double digits. And that’s why you can’t, for one second, put the state in one column or another. You’ve got to work until Election Day.
