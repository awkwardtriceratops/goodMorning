By Zolan Kanno-Youngs WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security launched an effort a year ago this month to address domestic terrorism, white nationalist threats and other acts of homegrown violence, a major shift for an agency created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to protect the country from foreign terrorism. Today the plan to carry out that new mission remains stalled in a bureaucratic morass as clashes between protesters and counterprotesters have escalated to precisely the violent acts that the plan was supposed to address. Instead a new crop of Homeland Security Department leaders, led by the confrontational acting secretary, Chad F. Wolf, appear to be doing the opposite of what had been promised. Far from cooperating with local governments and citizens to combat domestic unrest, particularly from the far right, they have joined President Trump in lashing out at American mayors and governors while deploying federal tactical teams to cities — often expressly against the wishes of the local governments with which they had pledged to cooperate. On Fox News Monday night, Mr. Wolf said he spoke with Attorney General William P. Barr about arresting leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement. Killings this summer in Portland, Ore., Oakland, Calif., and Kenosha, Wis., have heightened fears that the kind of ideological extremism that the department sought to address last September has burst onto the streets of the nation’s cities. The document published a year ago singled out white supremacist and anti-government extremism as primary national security threats, while also noting the potential threat posed by Antifa, a loose-knit anti-fascist movement. Officials at the time committed to releasing a detailed implementation plan within months. That blueprint was to guide federal and local governments as well as community stakeholders in how to work cooperatively to identify threats and address politically motivated violence. “It’s government dysfunction and bureaucracy at its worst,” said Daryl Johnson, a former senior analyst for the Homeland Security Department whose 2009 report warning of the rise of right-wing extremism was withdrawn after it sparked political backlash from conservative leaders furious that it suggested some military veterans were joining far-right movements. Some city leaders and former Homeland Security officials went further, saying in the absence of cooperation the president was exploiting the unrest for his re-election campaign, singling out left-wing agitators while ignoring white supremacists and right-wing groups.
