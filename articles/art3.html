With Your Kids<br></h1><p id="artcont">“The Uranus jokes never end,” an astronomer said. By Nicholas St. Fleur As a little girl growing up in Portugal, Raquel Nuno made birthday wishes upon shooting stars. She was born near the peak of the Perseids meteor shower, one of the most prolific annual cosmic light shows. Every year her father whisked her and her family away to the beach to celebrate under the celestial fireworks. There, she gazed up at the dazzling display amid a backdrop of stars as countless as the grains of sand at her feet. “I fell in love with the night sky,” said Nuno. “It just made me think about our universe and my place in it.” Now, a planetary scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, Nuno ponders the cosmos professionally. She studies impact craters on the moon using tools aboard NASA’s robotic spacecraft orbiting the moon. “I found my passion — my calling — because he brought me out to look at the night sky,” she said of her father. She’s not alone, many kids go through an astronomy phase. Even if yours doesn’t dream of becoming an astronaut, taking them stargazing and planet-watching is a great way to spark their imagination and help them fall in love with the universe around them. Astronomers, after all, are grown up kids. This Halloween weekend is a particularly good time to start looking to the stars — on October 31, there will be a full moon and a parade of visible planets. If you plan to explore the night sky with your kids, here is some advice from astronomers to mesmerize them with that cosmic movie theater in your backyard. The best way to begin your astronomical adventures is with the moon. It’s easy to spot and doesn’t require any fancy equipment to enjoy. On Saturday, October 31, there will be a spooky full moon — the second of the month, which is called a Blue moon. “The moon is a really great opportunity for parents to engage their kids in the night sky because it always puts on a show no matter where you live,” said Nuno. Even if you miss it at its biggest and brightest, you can take your kids and look as its phases get progressively smaller: quarter, gibbous and crescent. Try to make a lunar calendar with them by bringing paper and markers and drawing the phases of the moon you see every night for 28 days.
