By Lauren Hard In a New Jersey suburb, a woman sets up a tent around 8 p.m. outside a state Motor Vehicle Commission office. She will spend the night there, accompanied by her 4-year-old son, until just before the office opens at 8 a.m. The woman, Sumbal Nadeem, doesn’t need a driver’s license or anything else from the agency. But she does need money. She is being paid $150 to hold a place in line by a motorist who needs a car registration. The pandemic has spawned a new class of worker in New Jersey. They are the line holders or line sitters who, for a fee, will wait for hours, sometimes all night, outside a branch of the Motor Vehicle Commission — which was closed for four months — until whoever hired them comes to take that place right before the office opens. “I’ve been working every day, 12 hours a day,” said Ms. Nadeem, 23, who graduated last December from a community college. She is hoping to become a medical assistant, but has yet to find a job. “I barely get to sleep.” The Motor Vehicle Commission has been overwhelmed by demand since it reopened in early July, after having shut down in March during the state’s coronavirus lockdown. Even after making some services available online and pushing back the expiration dates for certain documents, the agency’s 39 locations — where paperwork is processed — have been inundated by customers. Lines stretch for blocks in the wee hours of the morning. Because of capacity limits to protect public health, offices often start turning people away by mid- or late morning. The agency itself has been hit by the virus, with some offices forced to close for two weeks after employees tested positive. Gov. Philip D. Murphy has acknowledged the aggravation many motorists have experienced, especially as temperatures drop. “Folks are frustrated by long lines, and so am I,” the governor recently told reporters. “We want to see those lines end as much as everyone.” While these struggles have been maddening to many, for others they have created an opportunity to make money at a time when New Jersey has only added back about half of the 800,000 jobs it lost in March and April. Websites like Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace are filled with people offering to stand in line, charging fees ranging from $50 to $600. Anthony Perez, 37, who lives in Hackensack, was laid off from his job as a designer for a Connecticut firm after the pandemic hit. He is still trying to qualify for unemployment benefits after being initially denied. Now he is using the $80 to $200 he earns waiting in line overnight outside motor vehicle agency offices to help pay some of his bills.
