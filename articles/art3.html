But experts warn that changing electorates is hard and complicated. By Astead W. Herndon ATLANTA — Jon Ossoff may not have known it, but a possible key to victory in his Georgia Senate race had just pulled up beside him in a dingy black van. Mr. Ossoff, a 33-year-old former journalist who is seen as one of Democrats’ brightest hopes in year when Georgia could be crucial for the battle of Senate control, was arriving at State Farm Arena in Atlanta this month to vote early. To his left, the van unloaded a gaggle of older Black men. “First-time voters!” the driver yelled as two of the men, Richard Sanabria and Tony Lamar Jones, walked out. Mr. Lamar Jones, 42, looked at the media circus surrounding Mr. Ossoff and asked, “Who’s he?” His question should come as no surprise. Over 100 million eligible, voting-age Americans did not vote in 2016, more than the number who voted for either presidential candidate. In Georgia, about 60 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot in that year’s presidential race, roughly on par with the national figure of 55 percent. As Democrats eye Georgia for possible gains this November — the first step toward a larger goal of remaking their path to victory in statewide races throughout the South — high turnout will be the name of the game, and that means persuading nonvoters to become voters. In traditional swing states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, most political observers believe that turnout is largely fixed and that campaigns rise and fall based on their ability to persuade a set of voters. But in the new set of battleground states in the South, as well as Arizona in the Southwest, the priority is converting nonvoters into voters. The thinking goes: If the party is able to reshape the electorate with new arrivals to the state — including young people, Latinos and Asian-Americans — as well as greater participation from Black residents and immigrants, a red state becomes a blue one. But experts who study nonvoting populations and the failed Democratic campaigns of recent years warn that the work of changing electorates is hard and complicated. There is no such thing, they say, as an inevitable demographic destiny. Nse Ufot, the executive director of the New Georgia Project, a nonpartisan group that has sought to turn out voters among the state’s new residents, said that doing so in a meaningful way could not happen with “five-minute conversations that you have on people’s porches.” “It is a sustained campaign that requires smart targeting, messaging and research,” she said. She added, “And when you think about the transactional nature of electoral campaigns, they prioritize getting people who are already voters to vote for them.” The work of registering new voters has become associated with progressive politics and is often an articulated strategy for Democratic candidates, but the groups make a point to target individuals regardless of their party identification. In 2016, nonvoters were younger, less educated, less affluent and more likely to be nonwhite than the average American voter, according to an extensive Pew Research Center study. They were also more likely to lean Democratic, Pew found, a sign of how a failure to motivate liberal voters was as much a part of Hillary Clinton’s loss as the persuadable swing voters who backed President Trump. Four years later, with Joseph R. Biden Jr. now leading the charge, Democrats say they’re taking a two-pronged approach: winning back some voters who supported Mr. Trump in 2016, and motivating nonvoters who did not participate last time. (That said, political observers on both sides of the aisle agree that no matter what Mr. Biden’s and Mr. Trump’s campaigns say, they have focused on persuading the voters most likely to turn out, like older and suburban voters.) Lauren Groh-Wargo, the chief executive of Fair Fight Action, the group started by Stacey Abrams in 2018, said she expected November to be the culmination of a decade of political organizing in Georgia.
