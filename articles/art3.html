He died of the coronavirus. By Michael Astor This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others here. Aritana Yawalapiti was a living bulwark against the destruction of Indigenous culture in Brazil. Known for his quiet dignity, he was a master of peacefully resolving conflicts between different Indigenous tribes as well as conflicts with non-Indigenous people. He worked to defend his peoples’ land in the Amazon against prospectors, loggers and ranchers. But he was powerless against the latest invader — Covid-19. Mr. Yawalapiti died on Aug. 5 in a hospital in Goiania, Brazil, some 400 miles southeast of his home in the Xingu Indigenous Land. He was 71. The cause was Covid-19, said Kuiaiú Yawalapiti, his niece. Mr. Yawalapiti’s brother Matariwá and his niece Nhapukalo also died of Covid-19 in recent weeks, and other relatives have tested positive. According to the Brazilian Indigenous People’s Association, 631 Indigenous people across Brazil have died of Covid-19 and 22,235 have tested positive to date. As the grandson of two chiefs and the son of a master shaman, Mr. Yawalapiti was born to lead, but he commanded respect beyond his pedigree. Powerfully built, he distinguished himself as a huka-huka wrestling champion, with a reputation for never losing a match. He spoke at least four Indigenous languages, as well as Portuguese, and was considered the chief of chiefs among the tribes in the Upper Xingu. The tribes in the region are famous for their kuarup — an elaborate ritual honoring the dead. Images of an elaborately painted and feathered Mr. Yawalapiti participating in the kuarup helped make him one of Brazil’s best known Indigenous leaders. In 1978, his life was the basis for the telenovela “Aritana.”
