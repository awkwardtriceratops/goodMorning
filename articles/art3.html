Not Officially, but …<br></h1><p id="artcont">NEW YORK TODAY By Troy Closson [Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Friday. What are you seeing at the polls? Weather: Bone-chilling rain and wind in the morning, with the temperature dipping into the upper 30s. Clear and cold on Saturday, then cloudy and rising to near 60 on Sunday. Alternate-side parking: In effect tomorrow. Suspended on Sunday (All Saints Day). Late-night frights and spooky traditions will look far different tomorrow than New Yorkers have ever known them. The pandemic means Halloween won’t involve large parades and packed bars, or perhaps even throngs of trick-or-treaters descending on doorsteps. Many celebrations will be subdued or altered to allow for safety precautions. [Read more about how revelers across the city plan to celebrate.] Here’s what to expect: Mayor Bill de Blasio said last week that children will still be able to take part in frantic quests for candy bars and chocolates. He stressed, however, that trick-or-treating should only be done outdoors — as opposed to in the hallways of apartment buildings. In New Jersey, officials passed on banning trick-or-treating statewide, though some towns have done so themselves. Mr. de Blasio has said that unsafe gatherings — where people are not wearing face masks or social distancing — will be broken up if officials become aware of them. Precautions are particularly important, he said, in light of the city’s positive virus test rate hitting 1.92 percent on Thursday, the highest seven-day average in months. Still, a number of parties and celebrations for young adults at “secret locations” across the city have been advertised for the weekend. In New York State, haunted houses are observing wide-ranging safety protocols, like temperature checks and reduced capacity. Take Blood Manor, the 10,000-square-foot attraction in Manhattan: Entrance is limited to 100 guests per hour. In a normal year, as many as 2,500 guests might come through its doors on a busy Saturday. But the potential for crowding and poor sanitation in indoor spaces has some health experts concerned. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has broadly categorized attending indoor haunted houses as a “higher risk” activity. Costume shops in Manhattan and Queens were filled with energized crowds in the days leading up to the holiday. Some families were planning to celebrate at home, dressing up and taking part in Halloween-themed activities like carving pumpkins. Others said they would attend outdoor horror movie nights. For trick-or-treating, several households have crafted makeshift chutes to distribute candy. Many are assembling individual to-go bags of sweets to avoid contact with strangers. And the popular New York’s Village Halloween Parade will happen online.
