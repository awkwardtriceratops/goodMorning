By Mark Landler LONDON — For weeks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has fended off calls to impose another nationwide lockdown on England. But now, confronted with grim projections of a spiraling death toll from the coronavirus, he is weighing plans to lock down the country for as long as a month. The plans, which were previewed in several British newspapers on Saturday, are in flux and could still fall short of a full national lockdown. But medical experts have warned that the virus is spreading at a rate that will soon overwhelm hospitals if the government does not take draconian action. Mr. Johnson’s cabinet was meeting on Saturday and the government said he would hold a news conference at 4 p.m. A lockdown would bring England in line with France, Germany, Belgium, and Ireland, all of which have shut down large parts of their societies amid a massive second-wave surge in infections. As in March, when the virus first engulfed Europe, England has lagged its European neighbors in responding. Mr. Johnson has been caught between members of his Conservative Party, who argue that another lockdown would devastate the economy, and his scientific advisers, who argue that it is unavoidable, given the exponential spread of the virus. “They have no choice,” said Devi Sridhar, head of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh. “It’s better today than tomorrow, and it would have been better yesterday than today.” Under the lockdown being considered, pubs, restaurants and other nonessential businesses would be closed for as long as a month, but schools and offices would stay open. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have already instituted such restrictions, leaving England as an outlier within the United Kingdom. The prime minister’s approach so far has been to order targeted lockdowns in hot spots like the cities of Liverpool and Manchester, while allowing less affected places, like London, to operate more or less normally. Mr. Johnson has called this strategy a “stitch in time to save nine,” though it has not mollified the authorities in those hard-hit cities, who have complained bitterly that the government was singling them out unfairly. But the latest numbers suggest the tailored approach is no longer enough. The government’s scientific advisory panel, known as SAGE, estimated earlier this month that there are between 43,000 and 75,000 new infections a day in England, a rate that is above the worst-case scenarios calculated only weeks before that.
