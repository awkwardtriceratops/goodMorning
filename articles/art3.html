By Gurbir S. Grewal and Jeremy Feigenbaum Mr. Grewal is the attorney general of New Jersey and Mr. Feigenbaum is the state’s solicitor. President Trump and his allies in the Senate have packed the federal courts with more than 200 conservative judges over the last four years, including three Supreme Court justices. In doing so, Mr. Trump made explicit that he wants “his” judges, and the 6-to-3 conservative majority on the court, to achieve what he could not through Congress, including eliminating health care for millions and undermining what remains of the Voting Rights Act. Much attention is rightly being paid to how the Biden-Harris administration will respond. But if progressives are going to have fewer victories in federal courts, then we need to think about what that means for states, too. Our proposal is simple. Let’s take a page from our conservative friends and forge a new form of progressive federalism. Here are four ways to do this: First, state elected officials must be ready to respond quickly to, or act in advance of, rulings from the Supreme Court. If, for example, the Affordable Care Act is weakened or struck down, Democratic state legislatures should have bills drafted to introduce that day to protect people who will lose coverage. And officials must act now to protect and expand access to reproductive health care — especially for poor women and women of color — given the clear threat to Roe v. Wade. The risks run further, though. The new court may also make it easier for companies to degrade the environment, and harder for government agencies to address racism. Here too, states can step in with policies and laws to patch holes ripped open by the court. They can take aggressive action when it comes to protecting our air, reforming policing, expanding civil rights and more. Mr. Trump’s mishandling of the Covid-19 crisis has shown that when the federal government cannot or will not lead, states can and must step up. But state elected officials need to be thinking ahead right now and the first states to act can create templates for others to follow.
