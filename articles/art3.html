It was Elizabeth Warren! (She did not make that montage.) The Biden campaign billed this as a montage of rising stars but it’s really a reward for many of the young people who endorsed Biden early in the primary. That’s right Astead. Of the 17 people involved in this montage, zero of them endorsed Bernie Sanders. Even though most people under 40 supported Sanders! It’s a counterbalance to the A.O.C.-style vision of young Democrats. The moderates strike back! Mayor Randall Woodfin of Birmingham was a very early supporter of Joe Biden. This format also allows the party to showcase diversity. Stephanie, Woodfin got elected mayor of Birmingham with strong backing from Bernie Sanders and his political group, Our Revolution. It was a big blow to Sanders when he endorsed Biden. It’s a fascinating re-writing of primary history. Yvanna Cancela, one of the “rising stars,” took some heat for backing Biden early in Nevada, when so many Latinos were enthusiastic Sanders supporters. I remember talking to Woodfin early in the primary and asking if Biden was as strong among Black voters in the South as polling said. He said “No. He’s stronger.” One message that they keep driving home: that while President Trump wasn’t responsible for the virus, he was responsible for America’s response. And the results speak for themselves. It’s the critique they know gets under the president’s skin. OK, it’s also clear that a lot of these rising stars of the party are not great at videography. There has been a lot of shaky video from what appears to be selfie sticks. It was an interesting choice to stagger the opening this way and not give more time to someone like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Robert Garcia, the mayor of Long Beach, Calif., featured here, also backed Biden early. He also lost both of his parents to Covid-19 in recent weeks. Surely not a coincidence that Pennsylvania is represented by two congressmen and a state lawmaker. It is the ultimate swing state this year. “That’s a big f-ing deal,” several of the speakers say. Maggie, if they’d given this time to A.O.C., she would have totally overshadowed the rest of the night. Limiting her to a minute and dividing this segment 17 ways puts the focus on John Kerry and Jill Biden – where the Biden campaign wants it. I think it’s clear that the Biden campaign was worried about playing into the Trump line that the A.O.C. wing really “controls” Biden. But “the squad” are, if nothing else, the most popular new members of the Democratic Party. They’re not represented here. It would be less about it becoming “her” night than about Republicans pouring gasoline on the “he’s a trojan horse” fire. Folks, do you think this 17-person group speech is working, or is it like being inside a pinball machine? I am finding it a little hard to follow. I am texting with a group of Democrats who live in the suburbs of Pittsburgh. They are not in love with this video, finding it confusing. “I know I can’t keep track of who is who. Nobody will be a breakout [star] from this,” one just said. Ending with Stacey Abrams is interesting, because she’s both a “rising star” – and has an unclear path. She fell out of V.P. standing early in Biden’s search, didn’t run for Senate. Does she have a spot in a Biden administration? Should she run for governor again? Abrams is also a head-and-shoulders bigger political star than anyone else in this montage. It was curious that she got lumped in with a crew of mostly state legislators. … though that is the last office she held. Abrams’s career has been built on bringing in more voters of color. She calls Biden “a champion of free and fair elections” at a time of voter suppression. The actress Tracee Ellis Ross is talking now. And now we get to the theme of the night: leadership. Tracee Ellis Ross is tonight’s M.C. Tracee Ellis Ross’s hosting job tonight may have been made more difficult by Eva Longoria’s performance last night, which got some rave reviews. Ross has already talked more about Kamala Harris than anyone did during the first night of the convention. Sally Yates was acting attorney general early in the Trump administration. She was fired after refusing to enforce Trump’s ban on travel from a group of majority-Muslim nations, which was later blocked by federal courts. “That was the start of his relentless attacks on our democratic institutions and countless dedicated public servants,” she says. Yates says Trump “fawns over a dictator,” meaning Putin. Sally Yates, speaking live from Atlanta, was recruited hard by the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm to try to get her to run for the Senate this year. She said no. “From the moment President Trump took office, he’s used his position to benefit himself rather than our country,” she says. “He treats our country like it’s his family business,” she says. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
