Not racism, not abortion, not substance abuse. With each date, another debate. Today’s episode is about the space they found in each other — and the unexpected aftermath of their breakup. “‘Old Never Happened for Him,’” Kathryn Jarvis
Kathryn lives in coastal Georgia. She recently published a memoir titled “A Red Door.” Randy, the college boyfriend mentioned in her Tiny Love Story, continues to live on for her. “I was hesitant to buy the house I now live in,” she said. “I was still working, it was expensive, I lived five hours away, all valid reasons not to make the purchase.” But when Randy died, her perspective changed: “Life is short, he was gone. I bought the house.” “Firefighter Chases Woman Down Street,” Marlena Brown
Marlena works in book publicity in New York City. In February, within hours of her piece about the firefighter (named Stephen J. Brady) publishing in Modern Love, The Times received a flood of emails from people who knew him well. When Dan asked Marlena what she and Stephen would be talking about today, she said: “It would be a hard conversation, but it would be a hard conversation worth having.” “When it came to our core values,” she continued, “we were actually coming from the same place.”
