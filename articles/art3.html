But the Lucky Phone Number Fetches $325,000.<br></h1><p id="artcont">The Chinese phone number, ending in five 8s, drew 5,000 bids because it’s considered auspicious. Such phone numbers are coveted status symbols in China. By Tiffany May HONG KONG — The defendant wasn’t so lucky. But one fortunate bidder is hoping the person’s phone number will be. The Chinese phone number, which ended with five 8s, was so coveted that it attracted 5,000 bids over the weekend from businesses and individuals eager to own it. It ultimately sold for $325,000 on Sunday in an online auction by a court in the Chaoyang district of Beijing. In Chinese, the number eight is a homonym for “prosper” — or, more bluntly, “get rich.” The phone number was among the assets seized from a defendant who had failed to comply with a court order, a local news outlet said. The identities of the buyer and the defendant were not disclosed, nor were details about why the defendant was in court. A phone number with consecutive repeating digits, let alone a string of the same five, is rare and considered appealing in China. A string of repeating auspicious numbers is worth an even higher price. Like a vanity license plate, if it contains the right combination of digits, it can be a coveted status symbol. A phone number that ended in five 5s was sold for $52,000 in an online auction last year, and a number with eight 7s was auctioned for $560,000 in 2017. Five is thought to be associated with emperors, while seven is a homonym for “life’s spirit,” or “qi” in Mandarin, China’s official language.
