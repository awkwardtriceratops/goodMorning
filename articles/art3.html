Others criticize him for holding large indoor rallies. To the Editor: Re “Spurred by Fires, Trump and Biden Clash on Climate” (front page, Sept. 15): You refer to President Trump as a president “who has long scorned climate change as a hoax.” But the reality is more sinister: Much as we’ve recently learned about Mr. Trump’s views on the coronavirus, he has been well aware of the reality of climate change. How do we know? Because in your own newspaper, on Dec. 6, 2009, Mr. Trump was part of a group that purchased a full-page ad urging action on climate change, in which he (and the group) stated, “If we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet.” So Mr. Trump knows the scientific truth, but for political purposes he chooses to lie about it to the American public. Apparently, he has so little respect for his own supporters that he just assumes they are too unintelligent to recognize what he himself knows to be “scientifically irrefutable.” Jeffrey Bennett

The writer is the author of “A Global Warming Primer.” To the Editor: Re “Trump, a Bold Climate Denier, Confronts a Charred California” (front page, Sept. 14): President Trump blames California and other Western states for the fires because “they don’t listen to us” regarding forest management. A glance at the map shows that most of the acreage burned involves federal property managed by the Agriculture Department. Yes, there are management problems, but the responsibility for most forests in the Western United States belongs to the federal government, and these lands have been overseen by Trump appointees for the last three years.

To the Editor: Re “Trump Defends Holding Indoor Rallies Amid Pandemic” (news article, Sept. 15): President Trump’s response to a Las Vegas newspaper tells us all we need to know about him. He told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that he was “not at all concerned” about catching the coronavirus at his large indoor rally, because he was “on a stage and it’s very far away.” Not one bit of concern for his supporters who were maskless and shoulder to shoulder in a large manufacturing plant. Mr. Trump, once again, showed he cares only about three things — himself, his bankbook and his re-election. Where is any sign he cares about his constitutional responsibility to protect the American people? His lack of empathy and concern for our health is shameful. Marla Allard
Washington To the Editor: I have to hand it to President Trump. When he said that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it, he was not kidding. Mr. Trump is now holding large indoor rallies with people encouraged to be physically close, to yell and scream, and to be unmasked. Since science tells us that many of these people will contract Covid-19, with some percentage of them becoming ill and dying, he quite openly is doing the equivalent of killing (his followers no less), and getting away with it.
