Rescinded Award to Journalist for Criticizing Trump, Review Finds<br></h1><p id="artcont">The department told a Finnish reporter that she would be honored for her work to uncover Russian disinformation campaigns. It reversed itself — and tried to cover it up — after realizing she was also critical of President Trump. By Lara Jakes WASHINGTON — The State Department reversed plans to include a Finnish journalist last year among its recipients for its annual courageous women awards after officials discovered she was critical of President Trump on social media, an internal review concluded on Friday. The report by the department’s Office of Inspector General noted a “broad discretion to select awardees” for its annual International Women of Courage prize, and said State Department officials were authorized to revoke their decision to honor the journalist, Jessikka Aro. But it also found that department officials “inaccurately asserted” that Ms. Aro’s posts on Twitter and Facebook — including those that highlighted Mr. Trump’s broadsides against press freedoms — were not the reason the award was rescinded. Documents and interviews cited by the review showed that department officials deliberately misled journalists, congressional staff and the public in explaining why Ms. Aro was denied the award after being told she had won it. Officials from at least three State Department offices told inspectors that “had Ms. Aro’s social media content not come to light, she would have received the award,” the review said. A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday. The annual awards were created in 2007, during the George W. Bush administration, and are usually distributed at a ceremony in Washington around International Women’s Day in early March. They recognize women who have taken exceptional risk or challenged discriminatory practices to further peace, justice, human rights and gender equality. Ms. Aro, who had fled Finland after receiving death threats over her reporting to expose Russian disinformation campaigns, was nominated for the award by the American Embassy in Helsinki. She was among 55 nominees from across the world in what the inspector general’s review described as a disjointed selection process. In late January, the embassy informed Ms. Aro that she was among 10 women who would receive the prize, which includes a financial grant and some travel expenses. But in early February, interns in the State Department’s Office of Global Women’s Issues were assigned to review Ms. Aro’s social media accounts, and they found dozens of Twitter and Facebook posts that were “considered controversial, some of which were critical of the current president,” the review noted. In one tweet, for example, Ms. Aro wrote that “Trump constantly labels journalists as ‘enemy’ and ‘fake news.’” She then pointed to an article about one of the president’s political supporters, who threatened to shoot reporters for The Boston Globe in the head for being what he described as “enemies of the people” and “fake news.”
