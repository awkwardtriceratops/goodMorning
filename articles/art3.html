If you donate now, Maggie, you get a free tote bag. Megan Rapinoe, star of the U.S. Women’s soccer team, endorsed Elizabeth Warren initially. Ms. Urquiza also gave Ms. Longoria an opening to talk about the fact that Black people and Latinos are dying at disproportionately high rates. Even though I agree this feels telethon-y, there have been no actual requests for donations to Joe Biden or even a mention of his website yet. There was one “Text Join to 30330” moment, Reid. And not, as Biden once urged debate-watchers, “go to Joe 30330.” We’re moving into hour two and things are getting way more Trump-heavy. Far more direct attacks starting to happen, I think. How did the cables figure out when to do the ad breaks, Grynbaum? Lisa, it’s up to each network’s discretion, but I think smart of CNN to take a break after Urquiza, the most emotionally intense moment of the night. The Dems could have let viewers collect their breath rather than jumping into the next segment. Megan Rapinoe’s presence here underscores how comfortable athletes have become in politics, from LeBron James’s voting rights group to Rapinoe directly campaigning for Warren and Biden. It’s a great point, Nick. A long way from the Michael Jordan era of “Republicans buy sneakers, too.” We started off talking about potential breakout moments … I wonder if it’s fair to draw an analogy from Kristin Urquiza to the 2012 Khizr Khan speech — Urquiza has become a force in Arizona and she could be someone Democrats turn to. Jenny, agreed. “His only preexisting condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that he paid with his life.” That line is still ringing in my ears. Wouldn’t be surprised to see Democratic leaders turning to her as the campaign goes on. I think this extravaganza would feel a lot more “Wayne’s World” if we hadn’t all spent the last five months on video calls and watching late-night shows taped from people’s homes. Now it just feels kinda normal to watch a parade of people talking on camera from their living rooms and kitchens. Seeing an entire segment on the Postal Service shows how quickly the Democrats have embraced the message of “protect the post office.” Big spot for Sara Gideon. Clearly, they want to raise money for that Senate race in Maine. The Sara Gideon introduction for Maggie Rogers was the first that truly looked like a political ad. Sara Gideon, the Maine Democrat running against Senator Susan Collins, is the first 2020 candidate to get a speaking slot. She introduced Maggie Rogers, who appears to be singing a song from the Maine seacoast. ABC, CBS, and NBC start coverage at 10 p.m. Eastern. In 2016, those three networks alone accounted for 11.6 million live viewers on the Democratic convention’s first night. OK, Reid, you know who Maggie Rogers is, right? Lisa I also do not know who Maggie Rogers is. Reid. Can confirm that the NYT Politics team includes several Maggie Rogers fans. Reid is not among them, clearly.  Big Maggie Rogers fan, but I’m a little skeptical that this was really recorded on that seacoast. No wind on the mic? I’ll try to get a fact check on that for you, Nick. It’s good we have a political convention so Reid can learn what “the kids” nowadays are listening to. My new music knowledge stopped around 2009. Oooo … can we order up fact checks, Alan? I still want to figure out that L.A. recording situation from the last musical number. Reid, I’m with you on ignorance this time. But I’m as struck by the photo montage as the seacoast. Perhaps the easiest and most essential thing for Democrats to do right now is show and remind people how massive this crisis is. And we have our first “audience reactions” shots! Convention organizers told me they were hoping to cut to people with cameras in their homes occasionally for live reactions, a la the common sports montages from living rooms during a game-winning goal. OK, coming up next – the first big speaker on network television in the 10 p.m. Eastern hour is Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a finalist to be Biden’s running mate and the leader of a key battleground state. Well, it’s getting more political now, as Gretchen Whitmer is on camera introducing herself in Trump’s terms. Ms. Whitmer gets four minutes to speak, and she’s live from Lansing, Mich. The 10 p.m. hour is upon us. More of the traditional speeches we’re used to, in theory, and Governor Whitmer – a finalist to be Biden’s running mate – gets a coveted slot. Is Whitmer the first pol to have a traditional backdrop? </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
