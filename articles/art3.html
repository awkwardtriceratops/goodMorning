A wide open women’s game beyond Serena Williams. This is where tennis is going. By Matthew Futterman Even before Novak Djokovic was tossed from the United States Open for accidentally striking a line judge with a ball during his fourth-round match, the 2020 edition of this tournament was not destined for any showdowns between all-time greats on the men’s side. It had also lost the moments of fan-generated, supercharged intensity that come with a packed stadium. Now, with Djokovic disqualified, the U.S. Open has almost fully transformed into a tournament carried by the sport’s next generation, with few of the mainstays who have propped up tennis for more than a decade, other than Serena Williams. “It’s a chance to create new stars,” said Jim Courier, the former world No. 1. “We need those new stars to be winning majors also for the general American public to really pay attention to them, but you have got to start somewhere.” On the men’s side, with Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal not here to hog the attention and trophies, the future is being scripted by a new generation of bigger and freakishly athletic players in their early 20s. And the women’s game, already so wide open, appears as though it will only open up further in the coming years, even as Williams pursues a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title before retirement. Djokovic was mostly overpowering in his first three matches, but it was Felix Auger-Aliassime, 20, of Canada, his country a quickly rising power in tennis, barely breaking a sweat as he dispatched the British star Andy Murray, who was making a comeback from hip surgery, on the court where Murray became a Grand Slam champion in 2012. The men’s draw, packed with Europeans, started with the most players younger than 23 at a Grand Slam tournament since 2005, according to the ATP Tour. Ten men under 25 years old made the round of 16, the most at a Grand Slam since the 2009 Australian Open, and the most at the U.S. Open since 2001. “This feels like a beginning of sort of the next phase,” Courier said. The transition will not be easy. Tennis has enjoyed a golden era during the past decade, with Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Williams staking their claims as the greatest pro of all time. It will not likely happen again soon. With Federer (knee surgery) and Nadal (hesitation about travel during the coronavirus pandemic) skipping the tournament, television audiences for the United States were suffering even before Djokovic’s untimely exit. ESPN’s ratings for the first week were down an average of 35 percent compared with the past three years. Competition from the N.B.A. playoffs, a league which is usually in its off-season by now, has not helped. As players that only hard-core tennis fans are familiar with duel in empty stadiums — Sunday afternoon featured round of 16 matches between Petra Martic of Croatia and Yulia Putintseva of Kazakhstan and Alejandro Fokino of Spain and Alexander Zverev of Germany — it is hard not to see the rows of unoccupied seats as an omen. “Let’s hope it is just this one year,” said Andrea Gaudenzi, the chairman of the Association of Tennis Professionals, which represents the male players and their tournaments. Williams — a megastar without whom it would have been difficult to see the tournament happening at all — may yet win the title. The less well-known Sofia Kenin, 21, of the United States, won the Australian Open in January and has also barreled her way into the second week at the U.S. Open. Naomi Osaka, the 2018 U.S. Open champion, has drawn significant attention both with her play and her persistence in speaking out against systemic racism. Even with them at the top, the women’s tournament is basically a crapshoot. By Sunday evening the No. 23 and No. 28 seeded players in the women’s draw had booked spots in the quarterfinals, as did Shelby Rogers, ranked No. 93 in the world. “The women’s game is so deep, anybody can win a major,” Jen Brady, 25, of the United States, declared Sunday after upsetting a former world No. 1, Angelique Kerber, to make her first Grand Slam quarterfinal. For years tennis relied on rivalries to sell itself. Judging from this year’s U.S. Open, that might not be possible in the near future, for the men and especially for the women.
