By Ben Hubbard BEIRUT, Lebanon — Rescue workers who had spent days searching for a possible survivor in a building destroyed by a huge explosion last month all but gave up hope on Saturday, saying they had no new indications that anyone was alive under the rubble. The search had captivated Lebanon since a sniffer dog named Flash drew rescue workers to the building, providing a dramatic glimmer of hope a month after the blast tore through Beirut, devastating residential neighborhoods and killing more than 190 people. But that hope has since faded, as rescue workers dug day and night through piles of rubble in a historic house destroyed by the blast, finding nothing. “Technically speaking, there are no signs of life,” Francisco Lermanda, the coordinator of Topos, a rescue group from Chile, told reporters Sunday night.
