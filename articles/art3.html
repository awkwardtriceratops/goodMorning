The sound of victory was loud. It was banging pots, honking horns and popping corks. It was spontaneous dance parties in New York and other cities, the images echoing across the world in widely shared videos.

In the days after the U.S. election result was announced, some of the 71 million-plus Americans who backed President Trump are grieving.
