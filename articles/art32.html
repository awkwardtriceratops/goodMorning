By Tim McKeough As evenings turn colder, blankets are useful just about everywhere: by the fire, in front of the television, on top of the bed. But they work well as decorative accents at almost any time of year — especially when they have vibrant colors and patterns. A large-scale textile like a blanket “can add a lot of interest to a bedroom,” said Katie Ridder, the New York-based interior designer. “Most of the space is usually taken up by the bed, so it’s a nice place to have beautiful textiles.” Ms. Ridder changes blankets with the seasons — “Cotton for the summer and wool for the winter,” she said — often using them to add a punch of color to a room. And because wool blankets can last for decades, she has amassed a large collection over the years. “In my closet, I have stacks of different sizes and colors,” she said, including a pair of blankets with a herringbone design that she and her husband, the architect Peter Pennoyer, received as a wedding gift 32 years ago. “They’re a little moth-eaten,” she added. “But we still have them.” How large does a blanket need to be if you’re putting it on a bed? Big enough to tuck in tightly on three sides of the mattress, Ms. Ridder said, although you could use a smaller blanket as a throw at the foot of the bed. Can a blanket replace a duvet? In summer, Ms. Ridder often likes to use a simple cotton blanket instead of a duvet. In winter, a light wool blanket can be layered between a top sheet and a duvet, she said, or a heavier one could replace the duvet. What should you do with old blankets that have holes? “I like to make decorative pillows out of them,” Ms. Ridder said.
