TRANSCRIPT The election in Pennsylvania is still far from over, with legal teams and counties across the state arguing over the technicalities. “Certain ballots are coming back naked, meaning that they lack their internal privacy sleeve.” And in Pennsylvania, that means they get rejected. “I’m opening up the initial envelope for them to open up to see if there’s any naked ballot or not.” “The Democratic Party plans to contact them and provide the resources necessary for them to be able to vote in person today. Because otherwise they’ll be disenfranchised.” Republicans filed a lawsuit late Tuesday objecting to any attempts to correct naked ballots. “It is my understanding that it is not permitted, based on a ruling by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and I’ll leave that up to the lawyers who are in court fighting about that to determine what to do about it.” But this is just one of the many legal battles over mail ballots. “As the election starts moving over to the mail system, new things start becoming issues and all these things become cause for really hard-fought court cases.” Ballots are still being counted the day after the election in Lancaster. “So what you’re seeing right now are racks of mail ballots that had been received Monday and Tuesday and are going to be opened here today and then scanned in.” More are expected between now and Friday: ballots postmarked by Election Day but delivered late by the United States Postal Service. What isn’t clear yet is whether they’ll be counted. “The law says that they basically won’t be counted, if they came in by 8 o’clock. But the PA Supreme Court says as long as they’re postmarked or even if there’s not a postmark, then they should be counted. That was challenged to the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court said that it’s a little late right now, we’re not going to expedite that decision on that, but we will make a decision after the election. So we’re just sticking those mail ballots aside. And so either the U.S. Supreme Court makes a decision, or we can actually then go ahead and scan them.” “That sounds very confusing.” “Yes. Hello.” Not all of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties are handling the uncertainty the same way. In Lehigh County, they’re taking the time to scan the ballots and keeping a separate tally until the lawsuits are resolved. “We will be receiving ballots all week long. And we time-stamp them when we receive them to make sure we know exactly when they were received by our office.” The confusion has put Pennsylvania in the spotlight in a way that has some officials feeling déjà vu. “You can see the potential for Pennsylvania to be like Florida in 2000, where the eyes of the nation are on us. We don’t have the hanging chad issue. But we have the issue of ballots coming in for three days after the election. We have the issue of naked ballots. I was worried about what would happen. And maybe some of that is coming true. We’ll see as we get further into this.” “I just want to get you to kind of clarify your explanation to the prior question.” “I could use all the help I can get.” “Did anybody ask questions about the segregation of ballots in the small conference room yet?” “They’re just ones that came in after after Saturday.” “Are you waiting for any further instructions to begin counting any ballots received after Tuesday, or are you going to count, scan them, tabulate them until you receive an order that tells you that you can’t?” “Yes. Yes.” “OK, and then any ballots you receive —” “Those ballots are actually down in the office.” “So we should have a final certified result from Lehigh County, absent any court order messing that up, by the 23rd? Gotcha. Thank you very much.” “Court cases after Election Day, I can’t remember anything that would have an effect on the outcome. It’s very different than other years.” By Trip Gabriel and Nick Corasaniti PITTSBURGH — Pennsylvania, the state with the largest trove of electoral votes still up for grabs, inched ahead in its counting of more than one million outstanding mail-in ballots on Wednesday, a majority of them from Democratic strongholds, as Joseph R. Biden Jr. cut into his deficit with President Trump. With narrow wins in Wisconsin and Michigan called on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Biden has flipped two of the three Northern industrial states that handed Mr. Trump the White House in 2016. Pennsylvania, the last of those so-called blue-wall states, loomed as a battleground that Mr. Trump must win again to secure re-election. Mr. Biden has a slightly broader path to attaining 270 electoral votes, but a Pennsylvania victory would put him over the top. Officials from both parties vigorously made their cases that the composition of the uncounted mail-in votes ensured that a Pennsylvania victory was at hand for their candidate. Democrats pointed to hundreds of thousands of uncounted ballots in Philadelphia and its suburbs, and to the fact that the mail-in votes had so far run four to one in Mr. Biden’s favor. “Biden probably wins the state by roughly 100,000,” predicted Rich Fitzgerald, the Democratic county executive of Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. But Bill Stepien, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, argued that the urban and suburban ballots would give only 250,000 extra votes to Mr. Biden, who as of Wednesday evening trailed Mr. Trump by 192,380 votes, a three-percentage-point deficit that the former vice president had chiseled away at all day. Mr. Stepien said that mail ballots in more conservative counties, including York, Butler and Blair, would cut into Mr. Biden’s margins. Both sides are maneuvering for a possible ballot-by-ballot legal fight if the race is extremely close. They may all be waiting for a few more days. “We’re talking about a matter of days before the overwhelming majority of ballots are counted,” Kathy Boockvar, the secretary of state, said at a news conference on Wednesday night. Lawyers for the Trump campaign, including the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, have descended on the state to mount court challenges. Republicans have filed multiple lawsuits, questioning how voters were notified of issues with mail-in ballots and allowed to cast provisional ballots. Hearings were held both in Montgomery County, outside Philadelphia, and at the state level. The Trump campaign also said it would file a suit to stop the counting of mail-in ballots, claiming election officials were not allowing party observers to closely monitor the process, particularly in Philadelphia. And the campaign moved to intervene in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, hoping to stop ballots postmarked by Election Day, but received up to three days later, from being counted. Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, condemned the legal maneuvers. “Our election officials at the state and local level should be free to do their jobs without intimidation or attacks,” Mr. Wolf said in a statement. “These attempts to subvert the democratic process are disgraceful.” If the race comes down to the wire, the fate of thousands of provisional ballots set to be counted next week might also be in play. Many voters who requested mail-in ballots but decided to vote in person instead and did not bring their mail ballots with them to be “spoiled,” or rendered unusable, were given provisional ballots, said Bethany Hallam, a member of the elections board of Allegheny County. At least one Republican lawsuit was filed to throw out certain provisional ballots, and Ms. Hallam expects more are coming. Mr. Trump “sent his entire legal team to Pennsylvania to try to invalidate legal votes in whatever way possible,” Ms. Hallam said. No matter who ends up winning the battle for Pennsylvania, the geography and the closeness of the race revealed a state pulling ever further apart along regional and partisan lines. Suburbs outside Philadelphia and Pittsburgh that once leaned Republican have become treacherous for the party under Mr. Trump, while blue-collar counties, where Democrats used to win election after election, have moved to the populist right. Mr. Biden, a Scranton native whose pitch to Democrats was always that he could woo back white working-class voters, fell short of that goal. Although he slightly narrowed margins in rural counties compared with Hillary Clinton in 2016, Mr. Trump, who barnstormed through the state’s most conservative regions, brought out even more of his base. In Washington County in southwest Pennsylvania, a region that benefited economically from fracking for natural gas, Mr. Biden won a slightly larger share of the vote than Mrs. Clinton did, 38 percent versus 35 percent. But with overall turnout up significantly, Mr. Trump won 9,300 more raw votes this year than he did in 2016, while Mr. Biden added only 7,650 additional votes. The pattern appears to have repeated across central Pennsylvania. “There was no dropoff” for Mr. Trump from 2016, said Rob Gleason, a former chair of the state Republican Party, who lives in Cambria County in central Pennsylvania. “It’s pretty fantastic.” Mr. Trump’s votes in the county rose by 6,000 over 2016. “He has a gift of getting people to be really for him,” Mr. Gleason said, describing the thousands who attended Trump rallies. In Philadelphia, where the largest number of outstanding ballots in the state remained, election officials said they processed another 47,000 mail-in ballots on Wednesday, for a total of 233,486. Lisa Deeley, a city commissioner, said that 347,000 in-person ballots had been counted, or 97 percent of those cast. She had no estimate of when the city would finish counting. Democrats in the city, who had hoped for a significant Biden win, were partly dejected by the closeness of the race. Fran Cardella, 77, a retired insurance industry worker in Philadelphia, said the narrowness most likely resulted from Mr. Trump’s large and frequent rallies in rural Pennsylvania in the closing days. A Biden voter, Ms. Cardella said the conservative rural counties showed as much enthusiasm for Mr. Trump as in 2016 when he won an unexpected, narrow upset in the state. “I guess they like his rhetoric,” she said.
