Or at Least to the Debate.<br></h1><p id="artcont">CRITIC’S NOTEBOOK Donald Trump and Joe Biden faced off one last time, and the winner was Kristen Welker. By James Poniewozik On Thursday night, Belmont University in Nashville hosted the second and only presidential debate of the 2020 general election. You may remember the jackhammer concert masquerading as a debate three weeks ago, in which President Trump showed up furiously spewing invective (and possibly coronavirus). Your ears are probably still ringing from it. The next scheduled debate was canceled after the president came down with Covid-19 and refused to participate in a virtual face-off, replaced by a ratings war of competing town halls. On Thursday, the president and his opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., met in a debate with a similar format to the fracas in September — similar subject matter and equally high stakes. But this time there was a mute switch, a moderator who actually committed moderation and multiple complete uninterrupted sentences. It’s a sad statement that the measure of an acceptable debate is that it doesn’t sound like listening to simultaneous auctions. But it’s 2020. We take what we can get. You could attribute the intelligibility of the debate partly to technology. After the September fiasco, the commission on presidential debates made the decision to mute each candidate’s microphone during the other’s two-minute responses. This didn’t prevent cross talk afterward, but it may have provided a cooling-off period. But much credit belongs to the moderator, Kristen Welker of NBC News, who kept a confident hand and a quick mind trained on the discussion beginning to end. Keeping order in a debate isn’t just a matter of interjecting and pleading. Just ask Chris Wallace, who ended his outing in September flattened like a Looney Tunes character who lost a fight with an anvil. (“I’m jealous,” he said on Fox after the Thursday debate.) Instead, Ms. Welker was firm and agile, finding the moments to quickly follow up and heading off filibusters — not every one, but many — with a crisp, “OK; let’s move on.” For all the talk of “law and order” in this campaign, it was nice to see someone actually enforce it. TRANSCRIPT “If we just wore these masks, the president’s own advisers have told him, we could save 100,000 lives. And we’re in a circumstance where the president, thus far, still has no plan, no comprehensive plan.” “You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks.” “Yes.” “Is that a guarantee? Is —” “No, it’s not a guarantee, but it will be by the end of the year. But I think it has a good chance — there are two companies — I think within a matter of weeks. And it will be distributed very quickly.” “This is the same fellow who told you this was going to end by Easter last time. This is the same fellow who told you that, don’t worry, we’re going to end this by the summer. We’re about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter. And he has no clear plan, and there’s no prospect that there’s going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.” “President Trump, your reaction. He says you have no plan.” “I don’t think we’re going to have a dark winter at all. We’re opening up our country. We’ve learned and studied and understand the disease.” “He says that we’re, you know, we’re learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home who have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their — out of habit, where their wife or husband was — is gone. Learning to live with it? Come on. We’re dying with it.” “I take full responsibility. It’s not my fault that it came here. It’s China’s fault. And you know what? It’s not Joe’s fault that it came here either. It’s China’s fault. First of all, I’ve already done something that nobody thought was possible: Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare. He’s talking about socialized medicine, and when he — and health care. When he talks about a public option, he’s talking about destroying your Medicare —” “Wrong.” “Totally destroyed. And destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. He tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor. They wanted to make it work —” “O.K, let’s hear, let’s let Vice President Biden respond —” “It’s impossible to work — it doesn’t work.” “He’s a very confused guy. He thinks he’s running against somebody else. He’s running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden he’s running against.” “Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4,000 kids. You’ve since reversed your zero-tolerance policy, but the United States can’t locate the parents of more than 500 children. So how will these families ever be reunited?” “Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels. And they’re brought here, and they used to use them to get into our country. We now have as strong a border as we’ve ever had. We’re over 400 miles of brand-new wall. You see the numbers. And we let people in, but they have to come in legally.” “These 500-plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. Big, real tough — we’re really strong. And guess what? They cannot — it’s not, coyotes didn’t bring them over. Their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every notion of who we are as a nation. A black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you’re walking down the street, don’t have a hoodie on when you go across the street. Making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, ‘Yes, sir,’ ‘No, sir,’ hands on top of the wheel. Because you are, in fact, the victim, whether you’re a person making, child of a $300,000-per-year person or someone who’s on food stamps.” “I got criminal justice reform done and prison reform and opportunity zones. I took care of Black colleges and universities. I don’t know what to say. They can say anything. I mean, they can say anything. It’s a very — it makes me sad because I am, I am the least racist person. I can’t even see the audience because it’s so dark, but I don’t care who’s in the audience: I’m the least racist person in this room.” “He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. He started off his campaign coming down the escalator, saying he’s going to get rid of those Mexican ‘rapists.’ He’s banned Muslims because they’re Muslims. He has moved around and made everything worse across the board.” “I have one final question —” “Would he close down the oil industry? Would you close down the oil industry?” “By the way, I would transition from the oil industry, yes.” “Oh, that’s a big statement!” “I would transition — it is a big statement.” “That’s a big statement!” “Because I would stop —” “Why would you do that?” “Because the oil industry pollutes significantly.” “Oh, I see!” “Here’s the deal.” “That’s a big statement.” “But you can’t do that — well, if you let me finish the statement — because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time, over time. And I’d stop giving to the oil industry, I’d stop giving them federal subsidies.” “Ooh!” “He won’t give federal subsidies to the gas, excuse me, to the, to solar and wind.” “Yeah.” “Why are we giving it to oil industry?” “Imagine this is your inauguration day. What will you say in your address to America, to Americans who did not vote for you?” “We have to make our country totally successful as it was prior to the plague coming in from China. Success is going to bring us together. We are on the road to success. But I’m cutting taxes, and he wants to raise everybody’s taxes. And he wants to put new regulations on everything.” “What is on the ballot here is the character of this country. Decency, honor, respect, treating people with dignity, making sure that everyone has an even chance. And I’m going to make sure you get that. You haven’t been getting it the last four years.” There were signs, earlier in the day, that the debate might be more chaotic. President Trump began his day in a fight with the media, posting an advance video on Facebook of an interview with Lesley Stahl of “60 Minutes,” whom he accused of being “rude” for asking tough questions in the manner of, well, “60 Minutes.” In his Facebook post, he added, “Tonight’s anchor, Kristen Welker, is far worse!” By the middle of the night, though, Mr. Trump — who has not historically taken kindly to being challenged by journalists, especially Black women — was telling her, “By the way, I respect very much the way you’re handling this.” (He still gave fact checkers plenty of material, albeit more at lower volume. “President Trump was better behaved tonight,” said CNN’s Daniel Dale, “but he lied more.”) As for Mr. Biden, like any leader in the polls late in an election, his first goal was to do no harm. But the debate was also a sort of do-over for him, a chance to get off planned arguments that got buried in argle-bargle the first time out. So the challenger played plenty of offense. We got a clear “Malarkey.” He attacked the president on his Covid-19 response — “We’re about to go into a dark winter and he’s got no plan” — while repeatedly displaying a face mask so pointedly you might have thought it was his running mate. He was able to deliver speeches straight to the camera empathizing with families who have lost loved ones to the pandemic. The president countered that his opponent was just speaking like a politician. You could argue about who got the better of these exchanges. But at least you could hear them this time. Mostly, the candidates kept their interjections nonverbal, using the TV split-screen, Mr. Trump scowling and jutting his jaw, Mr. Biden grinning and shaking his head. The debate was least intelligible when Mr. Trump began speaking in Fox News-ese, particularly when raising a baroque, unsubstantiated claim of business corruption against Mr. Biden’s son Hunter, driven mostly by disputed newspaper reports and right-wing talk. I’m not sure what voters took away from his unglossed references to “the big man” and “the laptop” if they didn’t have a Ph.D. in “Hannity.” He did at least take turns speaking, though. But before we go handing out too many gold stars for the president’s “new tone,” it’s worth remembering his likely motives. Mr. Trump, by most accounts, entered this debate in a worse position than he entered the first debate — and most educated guesses are that this was at least in part because of how he behaved in the first debate. The best mute button, it turns out, may be a bad poll number. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
