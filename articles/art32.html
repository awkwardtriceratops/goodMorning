Wave in Hungary and Poland<br></h1><p id="artcont">The bloc is trying to stop the Eastern European member nations from advancing discriminatory measures, but its legal powers are limited. By Monika Pronczuk and Benjamin Novak BRUSSELS — The European Union on Thursday unveiled policies intended to strengthen the rights of L.G.B.T.Q. people, proposals that appear aimed particularly at right-wing governments in Hungary and Poland that have promoted discrimination. The moves, drawn up by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, would classify hate crime, including homophobic speech, on a list of “E.U. crimes” that also contains offenses such as drug trafficking and money laundering, giving the bloc more powers to crack down on member nations. The proposal would also protect same-sex families in all 27 of the bloc’s members, and promises more funding for organizations promoting equality. The plan comes as the governing Law and Justice party in Poland faces the biggest protests in the country since the fall of communism in 1989. The huge demonstrations, which began as a defense of women’s rights after a top court’s decision last month to ban nearly all abortions, have grown to include calls for the protection of L.G.B.T.Q. rights. In Hungary, the government has pushed for laws targeting the L.B.G.T.Q. community, including a bill that ties an individual’s gender to their sex and chromosomes at birth, restricting later modifications on official documents. Announcing the European proposals on Thursday, Vera Jourova, the bloc’s commissioner for values and transparency, said, “Everyone should feel free to be who they are — without fear or persecution.” “This is what Europe is about and this is what we stand for,” she added. TRANSCRIPT “Too many people cannot be themselves without fear of discrimination, exclusion of or violence. That is a worrying trend in Europe of incidents such as attacks on pride marches and the adoption of the so-called L.G.B.T.I.Q. ideology-free zone declarations. We understand that during the Covid-19 lockdowns that the situation may have gotten worse because many L.G.B.T.I.Q. young people find themselves locked into hostile environments where they are at risk of violence or increasing levels of anxiety or depression.” The first-ever L.G.B.T.I.Q. strategy presents the commission’s key actions and objectives for the next five years around four pillars, namely, tackling discrimination against L.G.B.T.I.Q. people and ensuring L.G.B.T.I.Q. people’s safety, building L.G.B.T.I.Q. inclusive societies and leading the call for L.G.B.T.I.Q. equality around the world. We will present an initiative to extend the list of E.U. crimes in Article 83 of the treaty to cover hate crime and hate speech, including those targeting L.G.B.T.I.Q. people.” “This is about Europe in the 21st century. It’s 2020, and hate and discrimination of people from sexual minorities really does not belong to Europe of these days.” The commission’s intentions are hobbled somewhat because its recommendations are not binding on member countries. Any new legislation would need to be approved by the European Parliament and national governments before much pressure can be applied on nations who do not comply. Hungary and Poland have been at loggerheads with the European Commission over an array of issues, mostly centering around abuses to the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and the rights of minorities. The Hungarian and Polish authorities have described those principles of governance as “foreign” ideology, but most other European countries and institutions consider them fundamental to the bloc’s beliefs.
