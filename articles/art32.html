And I’m Frank Bruni, and this is “The Argument.” The Democratic convention is finally here, if you can even call it a convention. Like all else about a presidential campaign conducted in the shadow of a pandemic, it’s nothing like what happened in years past. Does that negate its usefulness? What can and should Democrats accomplish through this socially-distanced virtual extravaganza? To answer these questions, we’re doing something a little different today. Four of us are hosting the show, but none of the four is Ross, who’s on vacation. And we’re gathering on Tuesday morning after the first night of the convention. So we’re in the middle of a news event, which means plenty is going to happen after this recording. But whatever transpires, there are questions that will endure between now and election day and the morning after. They’re questions about the Biden-Harris ticket, about the state of the Democratic party, and about the threats to the election. So with no further throat-clearing, let me welcome our guest co-hosts — Jamelle Bouie, a columnist on the opinion desk, and Michelle Cottle, a member of our editorial board. Welcome to you both. Yeah, welcome, you guys. Hello. Excellent to be here. So let’s get right into it, starting with Kamala Harris. She seems to have excited people about November, and excitement was something that the Biden campaign was sorely lacking up to this point. I want to know what you all made of this pick, what its pros and cons are. And so I’m going to start with you, Jamelle. Were you happy with this pick, in a strategic sense? Sure. I can’t say that I was happy or unhappy about the pick. My range of emotions, with regards to politics, don’t really go in that spectrum. [GOLDBERG LAUGHS] But as far as thinking through the meaning of the pick, I think, as a political pick, it makes a lot of sense. And I think among the broader Democratic electorate, Harris is a pretty popular figure, a pretty well-liked figure. It may marginally increase the number in turnout for African-Americans and other groups. I think the weakness of the pick may come if Biden wins and takes office and it’s time to govern. Because I think one of Harris’s weaknesses during the primary was it wasn’t really quite sure what her vision was for governing the country. And given that a Biden administration will have to start immediately — no time for trying to figure things out, this is a running start — I think it matters that Harris, as a political figure, doesn’t seem to have some sort overarching vision for government, especially given the unusually high likelihood that she’ll end up taking over for Biden at some point, given his age. So for me, I was pleased by the pick. But more than that, I was relieved. What I wanted was for whoever was chosen to not be surprising, at least for people who watch politics even remotely closely. I didn’t want it to be a story that derailed everything. You don’t want this campaign, as it’s going right now, to get dramatically shifted because someone super out of the blue gets put on the ticket. And this sounds weird to say because, obviously, she is the first African-American woman who is in this position, but she was a completely unsurprising pick, almost the safe pick. She’s run for high office and been publicly vetted at a level that a lot of the people who were considered front-runners were not. It also was a nice signal that he’s not going to hold a grudge. Considering how petty the sitting president is, for Biden to have overlooked the early squabbling between him and Kamala, it just sent a nice signal. And then, of course, she is exciting, on some level. This is going beyond the usual ticket of two boring old white guys. It’s not exactly what the progressive left would have hoped for, but I think it does what it needs to do. Michelle Goldberg, I want to kind of pivot off of Michelle Cottle’s mention of the progressive left. Before this choice, there was a lot of talk about progressives having issues with Kamala. And it seems to me, but tell me if I’m not seeing it correctly, that since the choice, there’s been real unity. People have fallen in line. Is that your take on it, or what do you make of the progressive reaction thus far to Kamala’s presence on the ticket? Well, look, I think that there was always going to be sort of hardcore Bernie people who were very disappointed by Kamala, although people often forget. It’s kind of funny that we talk about Kamala as if she was some moderate when, by a lot of measures, she’s one of the most progressive senators. But she has kind of a troubling criminal justice record. She’s not as progressive as some of the other candidates on issues like Israel that matter a lot to a kind of incoming cohort of young progressives. She’s seen as closer to Wall Street certainly than Elizabeth Warren. My sense is that the Biden camp — I don’t know if they did this deliberately, but they were very, very smart, I think, to make it seem like it was going to be Susan Rice. Because that meant that when it was Kamala, almost everybody could feel a sense of relief, including people on the left. And I also think Bernie Sanders himself has played a really helpful role here, right? Bernie Sanders has endorsed this pick and so have other people who have credibility on the left. And then finally, I think that just seeing a lot of progressive black women who were really, really moved and overjoyed by this. And kind of seeing that made it a little bit harder for some other people, I think, on the left to quibble overly much because you just sort of had to recognize what this meant for a lot of people that are admired on the left. The funny thing about this pick is that before the entire primary started, if you would asked I think a lot of people, what is the most likely Democratic ticket? They would have said Biden-Harris. And so we just went through so much drama, the ups and downs of the presidential campaign, of the vice presidential search to end up pretty much exactly where it always seemed like we were going. It’s like that line in Edward Albee’s “The Zoo Story,” sometimes you have to go a long way out of the way to come a short way back. [GOLDBERG LAUGHS] That’s the story of the Democratic primary. We could talk for a long time about Kamala and about this ticket. But because we’ve got so much ground to cover, you just mentioned Bernie Sanders. He was there on the first night of the Democratic convention — or maybe one of you as a better noun. I’m not sure what we’re supposed to call this virtual event. But I’m really curious to hear what you all made of the event, given the difficulty of doing this without an arena, without a crowd that’s clapping and screaming, whether you thought the choreography of it worked, or whether you think this convention is going to end up mattering less than conventions ever have because of the coronavirus-mandated adaptations. Well, I had talked to the convention planners about this, and they had been thinking of ways to make it less — not staged, I guess, but even before they kind of knew what they were going to be dealing with the virus, they wanted to get more regular people in there. And I thought that the clips from people talking about their dreams and fears and hardships was actually kind of a good addition. These conventions tend to be about a lot of schmoozing and stuff behind the scenes. And then the public face of them is a long series of really boring, for the most part, speeches. And it’s like a big advertisement for the party. I do think that particularly in this moment, it helps to have a little bit of a reminder of what real people are going through. And because they couldn’t have everybody in Milwaukee and they were going to have to do it virtually anyway, you might as well take advantage of different people, different places. Jamelle, you wrote in the great scorecard that “The Times” does with various people, grading what’s happening at the convention, you thought Bernie Sanders was a real highlight and his speech was particularly important. Why is that so, not just in terms of the first night of the convention, but in terms of now going through Nov. 3? So I’ve been listening to Bernie Sanders speeches in one form or another for five years, and they typically have kind of the same rhythm to them and they hit the same themes. And I thought this one was interesting and notable in that it wasn’t really a typical Bernie Sanders speech at all, and it was very much the sort of plea for coalition-building, right? That one at the very beginning that he’ll work with anyone, even conservative Republicans, to stop Trump I thought was very important. Given that the political theme of the convention is essentially that Biden is leading a silent majority of anti-Trump Americans across kind of a demographic and political spectrum, having Sanders as the most prominent left-wing voice in American politics say that was really important. I thought it hit the exact right note of impressing upon listeners just the stakes of the election and the stakes of letting Trump win again. I thought Michelle Obama’s speech, on a similar point, did the same thing. Michelle Obama was, as expected, extraordinary. I was really struck, in terms of Sanders, his tone, which you’re right to focus on, felt so different to me from 2016. I mean, he said vote for Hillary back then. The words were correct. The script was what it was supposed to be. But I sensed this time around from Bernie Sanders, and really kind of from the whole party, a whole new appreciation of the stakes. And Michelle Goldberg, it gave me some real hope that between now and Nov. 3 and on Nov. 3, we may see no repeat of what happened in 2016. Am I just being a ridiculous optimist, or do you have that same hope? No, I mean, I think that I have that same hope. I think there might be a fair number of people who didn’t vote in 2016 not even out of some sort of deep ideological aversion to Hillary Clinton, but just out of a sense that they didn’t care that much for her and they thought it was in the bag, right? They didn’t foresee this utter catastrophe, this utter destruction of most of our day-to-day lives. And so yes, I think it’s very hard for anyone to pull the kind of tweedle-dum, tweedle-dee thing that certain people on the left have been pulling for most of my adult life. That said, one of the interesting things about doing a convention this way is that it gives a lot less power to grassroots activists, for better or worse. The kind of people who disrupted the convention in 2016 because they were angry about the treatment of Bernie Sanders, because they were angry about some of the revelations in the emails that were hacked by the Russians at Trump’s behest, they just didn’t have a say in this, right? So there was this kind of interesting duality to it. On the one hand, you do hear in this convention from a lot more, quote unquote, “ordinary people,” people outside of politics. On the other hand, ordinary activists have basically no say in how things proceed because they can’t start cheers or chants or interrupting. And so it feels more sort of homespun but is actually a much more kind of produced and polished affair. In terms of Democratic messaging and that which they can control, what do you think they need to accomplish in this convention and going forward to maximize the chances of the most votes on November 3? I think maybe the important thing that needs to happen, with regards to the entire convention, is the less about what is said and more about how what is said is reported. Because what we’ve sort of learned over the past four years is that earned media, how coverage goes out to the public is actually really important to shaping voter perceptions. You could make a good case that Biden is the nominee because the one-two punch of South Carolina and all those endorsements created this wave of positive earned media that drove the Democratic primary electorate to his side. And so to the extent that this convention presents a Democratic party that is unified, that is big tent, plenty of room for lots of different people of many different beliefs. To the extent that it shows a Democratic party that has a strongly contrasting message with the president, then I think it does its job. And I think it leaves the kind of impression you want voters to have. But beyond that, the specific things said, I don’t know. The general impression, that’s important. I think that’s a great point about earned media, by which, for the listeners who aren’t up on the jargon, we mean the reporting that happens independent of a political campaign’s chosen ads and stuff like that. But you’re seeing, apart from the programming at the convention, a lot of stories right now about how many Republicans have turned their backs on Trump and are actually campaigning for Biden. And that’s the great example of what the party is programming and talking about ends up going out into a thousand other media channels and reaching the public in different ways. Also most people are not going to be watching this in a multi-hour block. So a lot of what matters is the little clips that get repurposed and shown on the news and shown on talk shows. Journalists are going to watch the convention in totality, and what’s going to matter for how it resonates is these kind of little moments that become almost memes or become, as you said, earned media. I miss real conventions. I see a lot of people, kind of cynical journalists, saying, like, oh yeah, conventions suck, and so much nicer to watch them from your couch. I actually love political conventions — maybe not Republican ones, certainly not anymore. People used to call the White House Correspondents Dinner “nerd prom.” The Democratic convention is like “nerd Coachella.” You see people that you haven’t seen in forever. There’s all these tertiary events. Except for the big headline speeches, there’s five different places you could be at any one time. And so you experience it in this much more fragmentary way. I think that it’s not ideal to have a convention like this, from the party’s perspective. But the party does have much, much more control in this format of what to highlight. Often, these speeches would happen, and the live coverage would break away because you’re button-holing people in the hallway to interview different people in the party. They have much more control over the message in this format, and that could end up being good for them. Michelle Cottle, the climax, the headline act of this virtual nerd Coachella is Joe Biden’s speech on Thursday night. You have written extensively and wonderfully about the various influences on Joe Biden, about his sort of path through the primary to this point. What are you expecting, and what are you wanting from it? What can he accomplish with this speech that he maybe hasn’t accomplished yet but needs to? I don’t think he needs to do a lot of complicated things. I think, as with the message of the convention in general, he needs to convey the basics of compassion and competence. Now, he has a leg up, at this point, because the Trump campaign has basically painted him as a drooling imbecile sitting in his basement unable to string a sentence together. So all he needs to do, on some level, is clear that hurdle. He just needs to not pass out during his speech. But he needs to convey what I think people look to him for during the primary, which is a sense of humanity, a sense of empathy. That is something that, obviously, has been sorely lacking with the current administration. And the message of all these real people that they’re spotlighting at the convention talking about what they’ve been through is to kind of send the signal that this is the candidate who cares about this and who will actually take steps to improve your lives, that he cares about something other than his own ambitions and his own power. So I think just of conveying that, I feel your pain, I’m going to fix this. And then, of course, being not scary, and this is where the reaching out to Republicans, to progressives, the big-tent message will come into this. He has stressed that he wants to work with everyone. There is a place for everyone in his party. So I think all of those kind of basic things need to come through in the speech. He does not have to be Barack Obama. He is not a rhetorical god at this point, and he doesn’t even need to try that. So he just needs to let Joe be Joe, on some level. Michelle Goldberg, you made the great point that this convention gives Democrats more control than ever before because it’s not happening at an arena, people aren’t standing up able to do whatever they want to do. Is it going to matter in the end? And in terms of it having to have been reinvented and abbreviated and crunched, do you think this might be the beginning of conventions mattering less? I mean, I think it’s really hard to say, right? So it’s interesting to me to hear Jamelle be so sort of Spock-like in his response to this. And I’m curious about whether, Jamelle, have you always been like this, or was it the trauma of 2016? Because we were together at the conventions four years ago, and I feel like I had a lot of feelings. Maybe I was just projecting them onto you. But I remember being at the Democratic convention, and I wrote about this at the time, it was impeccable. Joe Biden gave one of the best speeches I’ve ever heard him give at that convention. Michelle Obama gave an amazing speech. Compared to the total shit show of Trump’s convention, which was this kind of pathetic shambolic thing with Scott Baio talking and a bunch of Nazis outside, I don’t think even the best-produced convention can change the political dynamics in the country. I do think a couple of things. I think first of all, conventions, beyond what they do for a candidate a couple months before the election, it’s good for a party to come together. It’s good for people to build these relationships. That’s why you have conventions not just of political parties, but of all sorts of organizations. It fosters cohesion. And so for that reason, I really hope that they resume them once they can. I also think that, again, because Donald Trump has chosen this particular attack on Joe Biden — that he’s senile, that he can’t talk, that he has to be hidden away from view — if he just gives a kind of mildly competent speech, a sort of ordinary, boilerplate political acceptance speech, it will do something to puncture that narrative. It seems — knock on wood — that it was potentially, from Trump’s point of view, a bad idea to lower expectations about your opponent to such levels. I was just going to echo the points that both Michelle Goldberg and Michelle Cottle made that it’s really strange, just from a political strategy standpoint, to attack your opponent as a bumbling idiot and someone incapable of stringing together a sentence ahead of a major event where people will see that candidate string together a sentence, a series of sentences, and appear competent. If there’s any political advantage in this moment that the Democratic ticket has is that the Republican attacks — the Trump attacks, specifically — are just so removed from reality that once people get any kind of direct contact with that ticket, they’re going to be like, oh, well obviously the Trump campaign is full of crap, right? So Biden is a drooling imbecile, not going to be the case. Kamala Harris is an anti-police radical, people are going to see her speak and be like, that’s nonsense. It’s not going to be the case. The ticket as a whole is in the thrall of leftists, well, we just saw John Kasich give a four minute speech, so that’s probably not true. And I think the Trump campaign, because it cannot actually campaign on its record or on current conditions, is throwing everything at the wall and will find that that just doesn’t work, that a voting public actually wants to hear about what each ticket has to say about things happening now and that the Democratic ticket is mainstream to a fault, you could say. There’s nothing there that’s going to cause people to think, oh, these people are dangerous or radical. But Jamelle, can I ask you a question? Both of us have seen Joe Biden speak a lot of times, and he’s pretty hit or miss. Like I said, in 2016, I thought he gave one of the best speeches at the convention. I’ve seen him give speeches on the campaign trail that left me with my heart in my throat, feeling like I was watching an actor forgetting his lines. This is such an important moment. Do you have any anxiety about how it’s going to come off? He’s always done worse in his impromptu moments. But a prepared speech, he’s perfectly competent of giving. He’s been giving them for his entire adult life. So I’m not too worried about that. The things I’m worried about have really less to do with the Democratic ticket or with the Democratic coalition, although there are, of course, tensions and divides to talk about within that coalition. But the things I’m worried about have just much more to do with election administration and the entire process of the election and how that’s going to interact with the president’s, I think, clear efforts to delegitimize the outcome and also the Republican Party, how it relates to those attempts, right? Because for as much as the conversation has been about Trump’s attacks on the election, kind of the key actor on Nov. 3 and Nov. 4, depending on the outcome, will just be Republican-elected officials, how they react to what’s happened. That’s a great point, Jamelle. Let’s use that as a pivot because this convention is four days in time. It will recede in the rearview mirror really quickly. But all around it — and Michelle Goldberg, you just wrote about this — we have this very clear evidence that Trump is cheating, is preparing to cheat yet more. We have this huge melodrama with the United States Postal Service. We have various other things the president has said and done to convince people that if the result of this election is not what they want, they can consider it illegitimate. How much does each of you, and let’s start with Michelle Cottle, worry about this truly being anything close to a free and fair election? Oh, I’m completely terrified on some level. Cheater’s gonna cheat. And I think that they’ve made clear they have no problem with doing whatever is necessary to undermine the process. I also worry about what happens if it is a remotely close election because all of President Trump’s efforts to delegitimize this become that much more of an issue if they are like, oh, well look, it was so close. They cheated. It’s all the systemic fraud from the mail-in voting. I think that the larger the margin is, the easier it will be for at least respectable Republican officials to say, OK, we need to move on, even if that infuriates certain segments of the base. That’s what Michelle Obama was saying on Monday night at the convention. I thought one of the most fascinating parts of that extraordinary, excellent speech was when she was essentially saying, get your ballot tonight. Mail it in now, or prepare to go. Pack dinner and breakfast in case you have to wait on line. She was basically saying to America, you have got to deliver the Biden-Harris ticket such a margin that the cheating is erased and that there’s no ability for Donald Trump to say that this is a fraudulent result. I mean, that was such a kind of appropriately cynical instruction to the American public, don’t you think? Well, and it’s not just the numbers that matter. It’s also the timing. Jamelle wrote about this that right now, there’s this asymmetry. And the Democrats are saying that they’re more likely to vote by mail because they are more likely to take coronavirus seriously and Republicans the opposite. And what that could end up meaning is if you look back to 2018, in the midterms, and on election night, it looked like Democrats had had a really disappointing night. And it took the days and weeks afterwards, as the full vote was counted, to realize that there really was a blue wave. If something like that happens with Trump, he’s extremely likely to just declare victory on election night and to try to shut down the vote count afterwards. And so if you think about, for those of us who are old enough to remember 2000, what happened with the fight over the recount in Florida and you multiply that by many states or many jurisdictions, and think back to the fact that Roger Stone, Trump’s criminal advisor, was involved in basically staging what is now known as the Brooks Brothers riot where a bunch of rowdy Republican operatives physically interfered with the vote count in a way that very likely changed the course of that election, while hapless Democrats relied on the courts. I do think that Democrats are not going to do that this time. They’re not just going to assume that the rule of law will prevail and the courts will protect them. And as I wrote today, people are already sort of organizing for the mass protest that’s going to be necessary if there is some sort of shenanigans with the vote count or if Trump tries to interfere within in some way. In 2016, the night Trump was elected, when I was envisioning all sorts of disasters, could I have imagined that he would try to destroy the post office in order to stop people from casting their ballots? Probably not. And so I don’t think we should assume that that is the last important American institution that he will use his power to try and wreck if he thinks that his holding onto power depends on it. Right, so there are things that are outside of the Democratic party’s control. What can and should it do between now and November 3 to try to prevent the worst happening, to try to make this election as free and fair as it can possibly be? Jamelle, do you have any thoughts on that? Yeah, I mean, I think Michelle Goldberg got to much of what would be included in that. It is first, providing for voters detailed instructions on how to get a ballot, how to cast a ballot, how to do it in person. It’s organizing efforts for people who need to go in person, to bring them in person. I think it would probably include distributing masks and stuff to voters who want them to kind of help people get themselves prepared for standing in line. Similar to what the R.N.C. and the Trump campaign are doing, kind of a nationwide plan to contest vote counts, which they’ve sort of announced that this is part of their election plan. I think the Democratic party and its affiliated institutions and organizations need to be prepping basically a defense of ballot counting, sort of a nationwide effort to stop that tampering. I think there needs to be plans for protests and demonstrations. This is going to sound very hyperbolic, but I think that we have to think of the task of getting Trump out as less of a traditional democratic transition and more of something akin to pushing an authoritarian regime out. And that’s going to mean in addition to at the ballot box on Nov. 3, there being a Biden lead at the end of the night. Because I think Trump is going to contest regardless. Regardless of the outcome, Trump is going to say, this was rigged. This is fake, whatever. But the key thing is, is there space for the Republican legislature in Pennsylvania or Michigan or Wisconsin to certify election night results and send those in before all the votes are counted to force basically a contest between the full count that’s if a governor certifies and the partial count that the legislature does. And demonstrations, a large vote count on election night, all those sorts of things send an important signal to Republican legislators and officials that if they take this step, they will be taking a step that directly affects their ability to hold power in the future. That’s the message of a demonstration — not for Trump because Trump I don’t think gives a shit. Now, there’s also something that the media needs to do. They need to start setting expectations, just as Trump is very aggressively pushing the idea that election night has to be it. You have to call this race on election night. I think there needs to be a fair amount of pushback where people are told, this very well could go on past the one night that everybody thinks of as the deciding moment, especially if it’s not a huge margin. And people have talked about the blue shift, where Democratic votes have been coming in on the later side. So what starts out looking like a close call then widens to be a more comfortable Democratic margin. Trump’s going to go berserk over things like that, and people need to be prepared but that is not cheating. That is not rigging this vote, that election night is no longer a drop-dead kind of moment. Because he’s been pushing the idea that if it’s not called on that night, it’s fake. And that’s just something that everyone else has to say, no, that’s nonsense. Can I push back on one thing? Everything you say is 100 percent true, but I want any one of you who can reassure me to reassure me. We can report that, Michelle. We at The Times, our colleagues at the Washington Post, people on the responsible cable networks can do everything you’re saying, and yet we live in an information ecosystem where we’re never going to reach some of the people who most need to hear exactly what you said. What do we do about that? You’re never going to get everybody. I mean, you don’t worry about something just because it’s not going to be 100 percent. But you’re also talking to Republican officials. You need to put the pressure on them. It needs to be one of these things where only the fraction of the base who is going to believe whatever, Trump shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue, they’re cool with that. Everybody else needs to know the reality of the situation. You can’t break into that weird alternative bubble with everything. But everybody else who’s not drinking the Kool-Aid needs to understand this. The more people you can get to understand it, the more pressure gets brought to bear on people like Susan Collins, assuming she’s still in the Senate at the end of this race. I feel like I could see something maybe mildly reassuring, which is out of character for me, which is that usually raising the salience of an issue like mail-in voting is a pretty difficult thing to do. It’s hard to get people excited about these procedural issues. The one useful thing that Trump has done by being both so blatant about the reason that he’s sabotaging the post office, and by just sabotaging the post office in a way that affects the lives of a lot of people who don’t follow politics very closely, is that people understand what’s going on. Even if they don’t understand all the nuances of it, they understand that they’re not getting their mail. They understand that they’re not getting their prescriptions. They understand that checks that they need are coming late. And so it has raised the public salience of an issue that otherwise might seem like a bit of procedural minutia. There’s a lot that complain about the fact that cable news media is responsible for reporting election results. Every state has a Secretary of State’s office, but people get the results by way of the media. But the advantage in this case is that everyone gets the results by way of the media. And so if there’s just a collective agreement among the non-Fox networks to say we’re not going to report percentage precincts. We’re going to report the amount of the vote that has come in. We’re not going to do projected winners until a certain percentage of the vote that we know probably went out has come in. Those sorts of things, if there’s a general agreement to do them, I think will help. Because in 2000, it was the opposite. Networks were rushing to get ahead of each other in announcing who won and who didn’t. And that actually helped create the space for the shenanigans in Florida. And maybe we all learned a lesson we won’t create that space this time around. There’s been a lot of kind of apocalyptic sentiment during the last few minutes of this. So I want to wrap up our discussion by leaving our listeners on a slightly maybe more positive, optimistic note. I want to ask each of you, and take it in whatever order you like, what are you seeing at this convention or what are you seeing in terms of the dynamics of this race that does give you great hope that the right thing will happen on November 3 or in the days after November 3, as the count continues, and that we will get past these last four years? Why don’t we start with Michelle Cottle. Well, I think there’s clearly much less internal squabbling among Democrats. We do not have the small differences battles that were such a problem in 2016. And I think Hillary Clinton was an incredibly controversial candidate. I know lots of Democrats who just couldn’t even hold their nose and stomach her. So I think that Biden, for better and worse, does not incite those kind of passions. And so it’s been much easier on both levels, both from you know what the stakes are and the Biden isn’t scary. Much easier to bring the party together in this situation. I just want to say quickly, I certainly know people who were enthusiastic about Hillary Clinton and are going to have a hard time voting for Joe Biden, even though they’re going to do it. So I don’t think that Joe Biden is completely anodyne as a candidate, although I agree, he partly just, as a white man, doesn’t inspire the sort of kind of panic and hysteria that Hillary Clinton has always inspired. So the thing that gives me a little bit of hope — and I’m not the person you turn to for hope — is as I said before, that I just think Democrats have wised up about relying on the courts and sort of procedural neutrality to sort this out. If you go back again and read about the Brooks Brothers riots and other sort of shenanigans around the 2000 election, Republicans had a multi-pronged strategy. They fought it in the courts, but they also fought it in the streets. They fought it in the court of public opinion. Democrats, at that time, really just had faith in the process and faith that the rules, neutrally applied, would see justice done. And I think that that is gone, and you have a lot of people now on hair trigger who don’t trust a lot of these institutions. They certainly don’t trust the courts. And so there’s going to be much more of an uproar if you see anything unfair, anything sort of un-kosher about the way that the vote is administered or the vote is counted. I just think that the Democratic base is much more activated and much more attuned and kind of much more ready to take to the streets. Somewhat counterintuitively, my ray of hope is exactly that Trump is trying to corrupt and destroy the election. This is not something that a confident authoritarian does. It’s not something that a confident candidate does. It reflects profound fear and insecurity, that Trump almost certainly knows that by any conventional measure, he’s losing the election, that he knows that the public is against him. That’s why he’s been hyping up these boat parades, flotillas of supporters, that the real popular vote is the people who own boats and who fly Trump flags. But I think he and his team are very aware of what the political mood is against him. And so these, to me, kind of desperate attempts to shift the ground on which the election is actually being fought — obviously, there should be vigilance and preparation — but it should also I think convince Trump’s opponents — not just Democrats, but sort of the broad anti-Trump coalition — that they’re moving in the right direction and that they have the initiative here, that they’re not on the defensive at the end of the day. I would be worried if Trump seemed super confident. That would fill me with fear because that’s sort of the I’m doing something that you people don’t know about, are not going to know about, may not ever be able to prove. But flailing like a child, that actually makes me feel a little more confident. That gives you your hope. I tell you what gives me hope. This convention gives me hope, in the sense that at every turn— every 15 minutes, every five minutes — someone says something that tells me that people appreciate the stakes here. Even though everyone in 2016 who was for Hillary Clinton and who was worried about Donald Trump certainly didn’t think he was just any Republican who might win, I still think the sense of stakes this time around that this is a crossroads, that we can’t go down the wrong fork in the road, that this is a kind of do-or-die moment for America, I’m hearing that loud and clear in this convention. And that gives me some hope that voters will bring the right urgency to November 3 and do the right thing. Let’s stop there. We are going to take a short break, and we will be back. And we’re back. And it’s that time when someone gives you all a recommendation to leave with. This week, I believe Michelle Cottle has something for us. Michelle, you have a recommendation? I do, and it might work best for parents. But you know, it could be adapted in some way. So obviously, I cover national politics for the board, so I just can’t live in that 24/7. So I have two teenagers. I have a 15-year-old daughter who’s a Broadway drama nerd and a 17-year-old son who plays any instrument and is in his heavy classic rock phase. So he knows more about ‘70s and ‘80s music than I do. And one extremely effective way to waste time and get my mind a wash is we have Sonos on our phones that connects to a stereo speaker in the house. And you each take turns picking songs and playing them. And so you get into this kind of groove where everybody goes and starts picking the music, and then you start fighting over whose music is the worst or who’s the best or who did this guitar riff better than whatever. And then if my husband gets involved, he likes to sing. He’s a frustrated Broadway diva. And so then the children are appalled, and they’re, like, yelling at me to make dad stop. And so it can go on like this for hours. And for those who have teenagers, my teenagers spend most of their time sleeping until 2 pm and then staring at their screens during this pandemic because they have nowhere to go. So this is a fun way to get everybody kind of thinking about something that they love. And I don’t sing, but that makes it even more fun for them because they can abuse me mercilessly when I feel compelled to break into song. It’s sort of like an old-fashioned jukebox. It is a jukebox. And you can cut off each other because you can break in with your phones on each other’s song. And at some point, it always degenerates into someone playing “What’s New Pussycat” at top volume. [GOLDBERG LAUGHS] I will not go into the whys of that. But at that point, you know it’s time to go to bed, really. It’s over. Michelle, Jamelle, you both have children. Does this sound like fun for your whole families? I mean, the time that we listen to music, we panic-bought a car during the pandemic. And so now we drive, which my kids aren’t used to. And they hate it, and they complain the whole time. But especially my five-year-old has very pronounced musical tastes. And the other day, for the first time, they asked us to play a song that we weren’t familiar with, “Exile” by Taylor Swift, which is actually a great song. And I’m not quite sure where they heard it. But it’s kind of fascinating to watch them develop musical personalities that are not just the albums that we’ve introduced them to. Jamelle, you have just been made an honorary member of the Cottle family, and you are playing the Sonos challenge. What song are you queuing up? I am cueing up “Girls On Film” by Duran Duran. Wow. Wow. Duran Duran, I’m back in college. Yeesh. Michelle Cottle, Jamelle, thank you both so much for coming on the show this convention week, and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future. Yeah, thank you, guys. Thank you for having us. Meanwhile, Michelle Goldberg and I will be back next week. That’s our show for this week. Thank you all for listening. If you have a question you want to hear us debate, share it with us in a voicemail by calling 347-915-4324.

The team includes Phoebe Lett, Paula Szuchman, Pedro Rafael Rosado, Vishakha Darbha, Kristin Lin, and Isaac Jones. We’ll see you next week. I was about to say the two Michelle’s. But I wasn’t exactly sure, is that OK to say? No, that’s good. OK. Yeah, it’s not like it’s Karen. [ALL LAUGH] TRANSCRIPT I’m Michelle Goldberg. I’m Michelle Cottle. I’m Jamelle Bouie. And I’m Frank Bruni, and this is “The Argument.” The Democratic convention is finally here, if you can even call it a convention. Like all else about a presidential campaign conducted in the shadow of a pandemic, it’s nothing like what happened in years past. Does that negate its usefulness? What can and should Democrats accomplish through this socially-distanced virtual extravaganza? To answer these questions, we’re doing something a little different today. Four of us are hosting the show, but none of the four is Ross, who’s on vacation. And we’re gathering on Tuesday morning after the first night of the convention. So we’re in the middle of a news event, which means plenty is going to happen after this recording. But whatever transpires, there are questions that will endure between now and election day and the morning after. They’re questions about the Biden-Harris ticket, about the state of the Democratic party, and about the threats to the election. So with no further throat-clearing, let me welcome our guest co-hosts — Jamelle Bouie, a columnist on the opinion desk, and Michelle Cottle, a member of our editorial board. Welcome to you both. Yeah, welcome, you guys. Hello. Excellent to be here. So let’s get right into it, starting with Kamala Harris. She seems to have excited people about November, and excitement was something that the Biden campaign was sorely lacking up to this point. I want to know what you all made of this pick, what its pros and cons are. And so I’m going to start with you, Jamelle. Were you happy with this pick, in a strategic sense? Sure. I can’t say that I was happy or unhappy about the pick. My range of emotions, with regards to politics, don’t really go in that spectrum. [GOLDBERG LAUGHS] But as far as thinking through the meaning of the pick, I think, as a political pick, it makes a lot of sense. And I think among the broader Democratic electorate, Harris is a pretty popular figure, a pretty well-liked figure. It may marginally increase the number in turnout for African-Americans and other groups. I think the weakness of the pick may come if Biden wins and takes office and it’s time to govern. Because I think one of Harris’s weaknesses during the primary was it wasn’t really quite sure what her vision was for governing the country. And given that a Biden administration will have to start immediately — no time for trying to figure things out, this is a running start — I think it matters that Harris, as a political figure, doesn’t seem to have some sort overarching vision for government, especially given the unusually high likelihood that she’ll end up taking over for Biden at some point, given his age. So for me, I was pleased by the pick. But more than that, I was relieved. What I wanted was for whoever was chosen to not be surprising, at least for people who watch politics even remotely closely. I didn’t want it to be a story that derailed everything. You don’t want this campaign, as it’s going right now, to get dramatically shifted because someone super out of the blue gets put on the ticket. And this sounds weird to say because, obviously, she is the first African-American woman who is in this position, but she was a completely unsurprising pick, almost the safe pick. She’s run for high office and been publicly vetted at a level that a lot of the people who were considered front-runners were not. It also was a nice signal that he’s not going to hold a grudge. Considering how petty the sitting president is, for Biden to have overlooked the early squabbling between him and Kamala, it just sent a nice signal. And then, of course, she is exciting, on some level. This is going beyond the usual ticket of two boring old white guys. It’s not exactly what the progressive left would have hoped for, but I think it does what it needs to do. Michelle Goldberg, I want to kind of pivot off of Michelle Cottle’s mention of the progressive left. Before this choice, there was a lot of talk about progressives having issues with Kamala. And it seems to me, but tell me if I’m not seeing it correctly, that since the choice, there’s been real unity. People have fallen in line. Is that your take on it, or what do you make of the progressive reaction thus far to Kamala’s presence on the ticket? Well, look, I think that there was always going to be sort of hardcore Bernie people who were very disappointed by Kamala, although people often forget. It’s kind of funny that we talk about Kamala as if she was some moderate when, by a lot of measures, she’s one of the most progressive senators. But she has kind of a troubling criminal justice record. She’s not as progressive as some of the other candidates on issues like Israel that matter a lot to a kind of incoming cohort of young progressives. She’s seen as closer to Wall Street certainly than Elizabeth Warren. My sense is that the Biden camp — I don’t know if they did this deliberately, but they were very, very smart, I think, to make it seem like it was going to be Susan Rice. Because that meant that when it was Kamala, almost everybody could feel a sense of relief, including people on the left. And I also think Bernie Sanders himself has played a really helpful role here, right? Bernie Sanders has endorsed this pick and so have other people who have credibility on the left. And then finally, I think that just seeing a lot of progressive black women who were really, really moved and overjoyed by this. And kind of seeing that made it a little bit harder for some other people, I think, on the left to quibble overly much because you just sort of had to recognize what this meant for a lot of people that are admired on the left. The funny thing about this pick is that before the entire primary started, if you would asked I think a lot of people, what is the most likely Democratic ticket? They would have said Biden-Harris. And so we just went through so much drama, the ups and downs of the presidential campaign, of the vice presidential search to end up pretty much exactly where it always seemed like we were going. It’s like that line in Edward Albee’s “The Zoo Story,” sometimes you have to go a long way out of the way to come a short way back. [GOLDBERG LAUGHS] That’s the story of the Democratic primary. We could talk for a long time about Kamala and about this ticket. But because we’ve got so much ground to cover, you just mentioned Bernie Sanders. He was there on the first night of the Democratic convention — or maybe one of you as a better noun. I’m not sure what we’re supposed to call this virtual event. But I’m really curious to hear what you all made of the event, given the difficulty of doing this without an arena, without a crowd that’s clapping and screaming, whether you thought the choreography of it worked, or whether you think this convention is going to end up mattering less than conventions ever have because of the coronavirus-mandated adaptations. Well, I had talked to the convention planners about this, and they had been thinking of ways to make it less — not staged, I guess, but even before they kind of knew what they were going to be dealing with the virus, they wanted to get more regular people in there. And I thought that the clips from people talking about their dreams and fears and hardships was actually kind of a good addition. These conventions tend to be about a lot of schmoozing and stuff behind the scenes. And then the public face of them is a long series of really boring, for the most part, speeches. And it’s like a big advertisement for the party. I do think that particularly in this moment, it helps to have a little bit of a reminder of what real people are going through. And because they couldn’t have everybody in Milwaukee and they were going to have to do it virtually anyway, you might as well take advantage of different people, different places. Jamelle, you wrote in the great scorecard that “The Times” does with various people, grading what’s happening at the convention, you thought Bernie Sanders was a real highlight and his speech was particularly important. Why is that so, not just in terms of the first night of the convention, but in terms of now going through Nov. 3? So I’ve been listening to Bernie Sanders speeches in one form or another for five years, and they typically have kind of the same rhythm to them and they hit the same themes. And I thought this one was interesting and notable in that it wasn’t really a typical Bernie Sanders speech at all, and it was very much the sort of plea for coalition-building, right? That one at the very beginning that he’ll work with anyone, even conservative Republicans, to stop Trump I thought was very important. Given that the political theme of the convention is essentially that Biden is leading a silent majority of anti-Trump Americans across kind of a demographic and political spectrum, having Sanders as the most prominent left-wing voice in American politics say that was really important. I thought it hit the exact right note of impressing upon listeners just the stakes of the election and the stakes of letting Trump win again. I thought Michelle Obama’s speech, on a similar point, did the same thing. Michelle Obama was, as expected, extraordinary. I was really struck, in terms of Sanders, his tone, which you’re right to focus on, felt so different to me from 2016. I mean, he said vote for Hillary back then. The words were correct. The script was what it was supposed to be. But I sensed this time around from Bernie Sanders, and really kind of from the whole party, a whole new appreciation of the stakes. And Michelle Goldberg, it gave me some real hope that between now and Nov. 3 and on Nov. 3, we may see no repeat of what happened in 2016. Am I just being a ridiculous optimist, or do you have that same hope? No, I mean, I think that I have that same hope. I think there might be a fair number of people who didn’t vote in 2016 not even out of some sort of deep ideological aversion to Hillary Clinton, but just out of a sense that they didn’t care that much for her and they thought it was in the bag, right? They didn’t foresee this utter catastrophe, this utter destruction of most of our day-to-day lives. And so yes, I think it’s very hard for anyone to pull the kind of tweedle-dum, tweedle-dee thing that certain people on the left have been pulling for most of my adult life. That said, one of the interesting things about doing a convention this way is that it gives a lot less power to grassroots activists, for better or worse. The kind of people who disrupted the convention in 2016 because they were angry about the treatment of Bernie Sanders, because they were angry about some of the revelations in the emails that were hacked by the Russians at Trump’s behest, they just didn’t have a say in this, right? So there was this kind of interesting duality to it. On the one hand, you do hear in this convention from a lot more, quote unquote, “ordinary people,” people outside of politics. On the other hand, ordinary activists have basically no say in how things proceed because they can’t start cheers or chants or interrupting. And so it feels more sort of homespun but is actually a much more kind of produced and polished affair. In terms of Democratic messaging and that which they can control, what do you think they need to accomplish in this convention and going forward to maximize the chances of the most votes on November 3? I think maybe the important thing that needs to happen, with regards to the entire convention, is the less about what is said and more about how what is said is reported. Because what we’ve sort of learned over the past four years is that earned media, how coverage goes out to the public is actually really important to shaping voter perceptions. You could make a good case that Biden is the nominee because the one-two punch of South Carolina and all those endorsements created this wave of positive earned media that drove the Democratic primary electorate to his side. And so to the extent that this convention presents a Democratic party that is unified, that is big tent, plenty of room for lots of different people of many different beliefs. To the extent that it shows a Democratic party that has a strongly contrasting message with the president, then I think it does its job. And I think it leaves the kind of impression you want voters to have. But beyond that, the specific things said, I don’t know. The general impression, that’s important. I think that’s a great point about earned media, by which, for the listeners who aren’t up on the jargon, we mean the reporting that happens independent of a political campaign’s chosen ads and stuff like that. But you’re seeing, apart from the programming at the convention, a lot of stories right now about how many Republicans have turned their backs on Trump and are actually campaigning for Biden. And that’s the great example of what the party is programming and talking about ends up going out into a thousand other media channels and reaching the public in different ways. Also most people are not going to be watching this in a multi-hour block. So a lot of what matters is the little clips that get repurposed and shown on the news and shown on talk shows. Journalists are going to watch the convention in totality, and what’s going to matter for how it resonates is these kind of little moments that become almost memes or become, as you said, earned media. I miss real conventions. I see a lot of people, kind of cynical journalists, saying, like, oh yeah, conventions suck, and so much nicer to watch them from your couch. I actually love political conventions — maybe not Republican ones, certainly not anymore. People used to call the White House Correspondents Dinner “nerd prom.” The Democratic convention is like “nerd Coachella.” You see people that you haven’t seen in forever. There’s all these tertiary events. Except for the big headline speeches, there’s five different places you could be at any one time. And so you experience it in this much more fragmentary way. I think that it’s not ideal to have a convention like this, from the party’s perspective. But the party does have much, much more control in this format of what to highlight. Often, these speeches would happen, and the live coverage would break away because you’re button-holing people in the hallway to interview different people in the party. They have much more control over the message in this format, and that could end up being good for them. Michelle Cottle, the climax, the headline act of this virtual nerd Coachella is Joe Biden’s speech on Thursday night. You have written extensively and wonderfully about the various influences on Joe Biden, about his sort of path through the primary to this point. What are you expecting, and what are you wanting from it? What can he accomplish with this speech that he maybe hasn’t accomplished yet but needs to? I don’t think he needs to do a lot of complicated things. I think, as with the message of the convention in general, he needs to convey the basics of compassion and competence. Now, he has a leg up, at this point, because the Trump campaign has basically painted him as a drooling imbecile sitting in his basement unable to string a sentence together. So all he needs to do, on some level, is clear that hurdle. He just needs to not pass out during his speech. But he needs to convey what I think people look to him for during the primary, which is a sense of humanity, a sense of empathy. That is something that, obviously, has been sorely lacking with the current administration. And the message of all these real people that they’re spotlighting at the convention talking about what they’ve been through is to kind of send the signal that this is the candidate who cares about this and who will actually take steps to improve your lives, that he cares about something other than his own ambitions and his own power. So I think just of conveying that, I feel your pain, I’m going to fix this. And then, of course, being not scary, and this is where the reaching out to Republicans, to progressives, the big-tent message will come into this. He has stressed that he wants to work with everyone. There is a place for everyone in his party. So I think all of those kind of basic things need to come through in the speech. He does not have to be Barack Obama. He is not a rhetorical god at this point, and he doesn’t even need to try that. So he just needs to let Joe be Joe, on some level. Michelle Goldberg, you made the great point that this convention gives Democrats more control than ever before because it’s not happening at an arena, people aren’t standing up able to do whatever they want to do. Is it going to matter in the end? And in terms of it having to have been reinvented and abbreviated and crunched, do you think this might be the beginning of conventions mattering less? I mean, I think it’s really hard to say, right? So it’s interesting to me to hear Jamelle be so sort of Spock-like in his response to this. And I’m curious about whether, Jamelle, have you always been like this, or was it the trauma of 2016? Because we were together at the conventions four years ago, and I feel like I had a lot of feelings. Maybe I was just projecting them onto you. But I remember being at the Democratic convention, and I wrote about this at the time, it was impeccable. Joe Biden gave one of the best speeches I’ve ever heard him give at that convention. Michelle Obama gave an amazing speech. Compared to the total shit show of Trump’s convention, which was this kind of pathetic shambolic thing with Scott Baio talking and a bunch of Nazis outside, I don’t think even the best-produced convention can change the political dynamics in the country. I do think a couple of things. I think first of all, conventions, beyond what they do for a candidate a couple months before the election, it’s good for a party to come together. It’s good for people to build these relationships. That’s why you have conventions not just of political parties, but of all sorts of organizations. It fosters cohesion. And so for that reason, I really hope that they resume them once they can. I also think that, again, because Donald Trump has chosen this particular attack on Joe Biden — that he’s senile, that he can’t talk, that he has to be hidden away from view — if he just gives a kind of mildly competent speech, a sort of ordinary, boilerplate political acceptance speech, it will do something to puncture that narrative. It seems — knock on wood — that it was potentially, from Trump’s point of view, a bad idea to lower expectations about your opponent to such levels. I was just going to echo the points that both Michelle Goldberg and Michelle Cottle made that it’s really strange, just from a political strategy standpoint, to attack your opponent as a bumbling idiot and someone incapable of stringing together a sentence ahead of a major event where people will see that candidate string together a sentence, a series of sentences, and appear competent. If there’s any political advantage in this moment that the Democratic ticket has is that the Republican attacks — the Trump attacks, specifically — are just so removed from reality that once people get any kind of direct contact with that ticket, they’re going to be like, oh, well obviously the Trump campaign is full of crap, right? So Biden is a drooling imbecile, not going to be the case. Kamala Harris is an anti-police radical, people are going to see her speak and be like, that’s nonsense. It’s not going to be the case. The ticket as a whole is in the thrall of leftists, well, we just saw John Kasich give a four minute speech, so that’s probably not true. And I think the Trump campaign, because it cannot actually campaign on its record or on current conditions, is throwing everything at the wall and will find that that just doesn’t work, that a voting public actually wants to hear about what each ticket has to say about things happening now and that the Democratic ticket is mainstream to a fault, you could say. There’s nothing there that’s going to cause people to think, oh, these people are dangerous or radical. But Jamelle, can I ask you a question? Both of us have seen Joe Biden speak a lot of times, and he’s pretty hit or miss. Like I said, in 2016, I thought he gave one of the best speeches at the convention. I’ve seen him give speeches on the campaign trail that left me with my heart in my throat, feeling like I was watching an actor forgetting his lines. This is such an important moment. Do you have any anxiety about how it’s going to come off? He’s always done worse in his impromptu moments. But a prepared speech, he’s perfectly competent of giving. He’s been giving them for his entire adult life. So I’m not too worried about that. The things I’m worried about have really less to do with the Democratic ticket or with the Democratic coalition, although there are, of course, tensions and divides to talk about within that coalition. But the things I’m worried about have just much more to do with election administration and the entire process of the election and how that’s going to interact with the president’s, I think, clear efforts to delegitimize the outcome and also the Republican Party, how it relates to those attempts, right? Because for as much as the conversation has been about Trump’s attacks on the election, kind of the key actor on Nov. 3 and Nov. 4, depending on the outcome, will just be Republican-elected officials, how they react to what’s happened. That’s a great point, Jamelle. Let’s use that as a pivot because this convention is four days in time. It will recede in the rearview mirror really quickly. But all around it — and Michelle Goldberg, you just wrote about this — we have this very clear evidence that Trump is cheating, is preparing to cheat yet more. We have this huge melodrama with the United States Postal Service. We have various other things the president has said and done to convince people that if the result of this election is not what they want, they can consider it illegitimate. How much does each of you, and let’s start with Michelle Cottle, worry about this truly being anything close to a free and fair election? Oh, I’m completely terrified on some level. Cheater’s gonna cheat. And I think that they’ve made clear they have no problem with doing whatever is necessary to undermine the process. I also worry about what happens if it is a remotely close election because all of President Trump’s efforts to delegitimize this become that much more of an issue if they are like, oh, well look, it was so close. They cheated. It’s all the systemic fraud from the mail-in voting. I think that the larger the margin is, the easier it will be for at least respectable Republican officials to say, OK, we need to move on, even if that infuriates certain segments of the base. That’s what Michelle Obama was saying on Monday night at the convention. I thought one of the most fascinating parts of that extraordinary, excellent speech was when she was essentially saying, get your ballot tonight. Mail it in now, or prepare to go. Pack dinner and breakfast in case you have to wait on line. She was basically saying to America, you have got to deliver the Biden-Harris ticket such a margin that the cheating is erased and that there’s no ability for Donald Trump to say that this is a fraudulent result. I mean, that was such a kind of appropriately cynical instruction to the American public, don’t you think? Well, and it’s not just the numbers that matter. It’s also the timing. Jamelle wrote about this that right now, there’s this asymmetry. And the Democrats are saying that they’re more likely to vote by mail because they are more likely to take coronavirus seriously and Republicans the opposite. And what that could end up meaning is if you look back to 2018, in the midterms, and on election night, it looked like Democrats had had a really disappointing night. And it took the days and weeks afterwards, as the full vote was counted, to realize that there really was a blue wave. If something like that happens with Trump, he’s extremely likely to just declare victory on election night and to try to shut down the vote count afterwards. And so if you think about, for those of us who are old enough to remember 2000, what happened with the fight over the recount in Florida and you multiply that by many states or many jurisdictions, and think back to the fact that Roger Stone, Trump’s criminal advisor, was involved in basically staging what is now known as the Brooks Brothers riot where a bunch of rowdy Republican operatives physically interfered with the vote count in a way that very likely changed the course of that election, while hapless Democrats relied on the courts. I do think that Democrats are not going to do that this time. They’re not just going to assume that the rule of law will prevail and the courts will protect them. And as I wrote today, people are already sort of organizing for the mass protest that’s going to be necessary if there is some sort of shenanigans with the vote count or if Trump tries to interfere within in some way. In 2016, the night Trump was elected, when I was envisioning all sorts of disasters, could I have imagined that he would try to destroy the post office in order to stop people from casting their ballots? Probably not. And so I don’t think we should assume that that is the last important American institution that he will use his power to try and wreck if he thinks that his holding onto power depends on it. Right, so there are things that are outside of the Democratic party’s control. What can and should it do between now and November 3 to try to prevent the worst happening, to try to make this election as free and fair as it can possibly be? Jamelle, do you have any thoughts on that? Yeah, I mean, I think Michelle Goldberg got to much of what would be included in that. It is first, providing for voters detailed instructions on how to get a ballot, how to cast a ballot, how to do it in person. It’s organizing efforts for people who need to go in person, to bring them in person. I think it would probably include distributing masks and stuff to voters who want them to kind of help people get themselves prepared for standing in line. Similar to what the R.N.C. and the Trump campaign are doing, kind of a nationwide plan to contest vote counts, which they’ve sort of announced that this is part of their election plan. I think the Democratic party and its affiliated institutions and organizations need to be prepping basically a defense of ballot counting, sort of a nationwide effort to stop that tampering. I think there needs to be plans for protests and demonstrations. This is going to sound very hyperbolic, but I think that we have to think of the task of getting Trump out as less of a traditional democratic transition and more of something akin to pushing an authoritarian regime out. And that’s going to mean in addition to at the ballot box on Nov. 3, there being a Biden lead at the end of the night. Because I think Trump is going to contest regardless. Regardless of the outcome, Trump is going to say, this was rigged. This is fake, whatever. But the key thing is, is there space for the Republican legislature in Pennsylvania or Michigan or Wisconsin to certify election night results and send those in before all the votes are counted to force basically a contest between the full count that’s if a governor certifies and the partial count that the legislature does. And demonstrations, a large vote count on election night, all those sorts of things send an important signal to Republican legislators and officials that if they take this step, they will be taking a step that directly affects their ability to hold power in the future. That’s the message of a demonstration — not for Trump because Trump I don’t think gives a shit. Now, there’s also something that the media needs to do. They need to start setting expectations, just as Trump is very aggressively pushing the idea that election night has to be it. You have to call this race on election night. I think there needs to be a fair amount of pushback where people are told, this very well could go on past the one night that everybody thinks of as the deciding moment, especially if it’s not a huge margin. And people have talked about the blue shift, where Democratic votes have been coming in on the later side. So what starts out looking like a close call then widens to be a more comfortable Democratic margin. Trump’s going to go berserk over things like that, and people need to be prepared but that is not cheating. That is not rigging this vote, that election night is no longer a drop-dead kind of moment. Because he’s been pushing the idea that if it’s not called on that night, it’s fake. And that’s just something that everyone else has to say, no, that’s nonsense. Can I push back on one thing? Everything you say is 100 percent true, but I want any one of you who can reassure me to reassure me. We can report that, Michelle. We at The Times, our colleagues at the Washington Post, people on the responsible cable networks can do everything you’re saying, and yet we live in an information ecosystem where we’re never going to reach some of the people who most need to hear exactly what you said. What do we do about that? You’re never going to get everybody. I mean, you don’t worry about something just because it’s not going to be 100 percent. But you’re also talking to Republican officials. You need to put the pressure on them. It needs to be one of these things where only the fraction of the base who is going to believe whatever, Trump shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue, they’re cool with that. Everybody else needs to know the reality of the situation. You can’t break into that weird alternative bubble with everything. But everybody else who’s not drinking the Kool-Aid needs to understand this. The more people you can get to understand it, the more pressure gets brought to bear on people like Susan Collins, assuming she’s still in the Senate at the end of this race. I feel like I could see something maybe mildly reassuring, which is out of character for me, which is that usually raising the salience of an issue like mail-in voting is a pretty difficult thing to do. It’s hard to get people excited about these procedural issues. The one useful thing that Trump has done by being both so blatant about the reason that he’s sabotaging the post office, and by just sabotaging the post office in a way that affects the lives of a lot of people who don’t follow politics very closely, is that people understand what’s going on. Even if they don’t understand all the nuances of it, they understand that they’re not getting their mail. They understand that they’re not getting their prescriptions. They understand that checks that they need are coming late. And so it has raised the public salience of an issue that otherwise might seem like a bit of procedural minutia. There’s a lot that complain about the fact that cable news media is responsible for reporting election results. Every state has a Secretary of State’s office, but people get the results by way of the media. But the advantage in this case is that everyone gets the results by way of the media. And so if there’s just a collective agreement among the non-Fox networks to say we’re not going to report percentage precincts. We’re going to report the amount of the vote that has come in. We’re not going to do projected winners until a certain percentage of the vote that we know probably went out has come in. Those sorts of things, if there’s a general agreement to do them, I think will help. Because in 2000, it was the opposite. Networks were rushing to get ahead of each other in announcing who won and who didn’t. And that actually helped create the space for the shenanigans in Florida. And maybe we all learned a lesson we won’t create that space this time around. There’s been a lot of kind of apocalyptic sentiment during the last few minutes of this. So I want to wrap up our discussion by leaving our listeners on a slightly maybe more positive, optimistic note. I want to ask each of you, and take it in whatever order you like, what are you seeing at this convention or what are you seeing in terms of the dynamics of this race that does give you great hope that the right thing will happen on November 3 or in the days after November 3, as the count continues, and that we will get past these last four years? Why don’t we start with Michelle Cottle. Well, I think there’s clearly much less internal squabbling among Democrats. We do not have the small differences battles that were such a problem in 2016. And I think Hillary Clinton was an incredibly controversial candidate. I know lots of Democrats who just couldn’t even hold their nose and stomach her. So I think that Biden, for better and worse, does not incite those kind of passions. And so it’s been much easier on both levels, both from you know what the stakes are and the Biden isn’t scary. Much easier to bring the party together in this situation. I just want to say quickly, I certainly know people who were enthusiastic about Hillary Clinton and are going to have a hard time voting for Joe Biden, even though they’re going to do it. So I don’t think that Joe Biden is completely anodyne as a candidate, although I agree, he partly just, as a white man, doesn’t inspire the sort of kind of panic and hysteria that Hillary Clinton has always inspired. So the thing that gives me a little bit of hope — and I’m not the person you turn to for hope — is as I said before, that I just think Democrats have wised up about relying on the courts and sort of procedural neutrality to sort this out. If you go back again and read about the Brooks Brothers riots and other sort of shenanigans around the 2000 election, Republicans had a multi-pronged strategy. They fought it in the courts, but they also fought it in the streets. They fought it in the court of public opinion. Democrats, at that time, really just had faith in the process and faith that the rules, neutrally applied, would see justice done. And I think that that is gone, and you have a lot of people now on hair trigger who don’t trust a lot of these institutions. They certainly don’t trust the courts. And so there’s going to be much more of an uproar if you see anything unfair, anything sort of un-kosher about the way that the vote is administered or the vote is counted. I just think that the Democratic base is much more activated and much more attuned and kind of much more ready to take to the streets. Somewhat counterintuitively, my ray of hope is exactly that Trump is trying to corrupt and destroy the election. This is not something that a confident authoritarian does. It’s not something that a confident candidate does. It reflects profound fear and insecurity, that Trump almost certainly knows that by any conventional measure, he’s losing the election, that he knows that the public is against him. That’s why he’s been hyping up these boat parades, flotillas of supporters, that the real popular vote is the people who own boats and who fly Trump flags. But I think he and his team are very aware of what the political mood is against him. And so these, to me, kind of desperate attempts to shift the ground on which the election is actually being fought — obviously, there should be vigilance and preparation — but it should also I think convince Trump’s opponents — not just Democrats, but sort of the broad anti-Trump coalition — that they’re moving in the right direction and that they have the initiative here, that they’re not on the defensive at the end of the day. I would be worried if Trump seemed super confident. That would fill me with fear because that’s sort of the I’m doing something that you people don’t know about, are not going to know about, may not ever be able to prove. But flailing like a child, that actually makes me feel a little more confident. That gives you your hope. I tell you what gives me hope. This convention gives me hope, in the sense that at every turn— every 15 minutes, every five minutes — someone says something that tells me that people appreciate the stakes here. Even though everyone in 2016 who was for Hillary Clinton and who was worried about Donald Trump certainly didn’t think he was just any Republican who might win, I still think the sense of stakes this time around that this is a crossroads, that we can’t go down the wrong fork in the road, that this is a kind of do-or-die moment for America, I’m hearing that loud and clear in this convention. And that gives me some hope that voters will bring the right urgency to November 3 and do the right thing. Let’s stop there. We are going to take a short break, and we will be back. And we’re back. And it’s that time when someone gives you all a recommendation to leave with. This week, I believe Michelle Cottle has something for us. Michelle, you have a recommendation? I do, and it might work best for parents. But you know, it could be adapted in some way. So obviously, I cover national politics for the board, so I just can’t live in that 24/7. So I have two teenagers. I have a 15-year-old daughter who’s a Broadway drama nerd and a 17-year-old son who plays any instrument and is in his heavy classic rock phase. So he knows more about ‘70s and ‘80s music than I do. And one extremely effective way to waste time and get my mind a wash is we have Sonos on our phones that connects to a stereo speaker in the house. And you each take turns picking songs and playing them. And so you get into this kind of groove where everybody goes and starts picking the music, and then you start fighting over whose music is the worst or who’s the best or who did this guitar riff better than whatever. And then if my husband gets involved, he likes to sing. He’s a frustrated Broadway diva. And so then the children are appalled, and they’re, like, yelling at me to make dad stop. And so it can go on like this for hours. And for those who have teenagers, my teenagers spend most of their time sleeping until 2 pm and then staring at their screens during this pandemic because they have nowhere to go. So this is a fun way to get everybody kind of thinking about something that they love. And I don’t sing, but that makes it even more fun for them because they can abuse me mercilessly when I feel compelled to break into song. It’s sort of like an old-fashioned jukebox. It is a jukebox. And you can cut off each other because you can break in with your phones on each other’s song. And at some point, it always degenerates into someone playing “What’s New Pussycat” at top volume. [GOLDBERG LAUGHS] I will not go into the whys of that. But at that point, you know it’s time to go to bed, really. It’s over. Michelle, Jamelle, you both have children. Does this sound like fun for your whole families? I mean, the time that we listen to music, we panic-bought a car during the pandemic. And so now we drive, which my kids aren’t used to. And they hate it, and they complain the whole time. But especially my five-year-old has very pronounced musical tastes. And the other day, for the first time, they asked us to play a song that we weren’t familiar with, “Exile” by Taylor Swift, which is actually a great song. And I’m not quite sure where they heard it. But it’s kind of fascinating to watch them develop musical personalities that are not just the albums that we’ve introduced them to. Jamelle, you have just been made an honorary member of the Cottle family, and you are playing the Sonos challenge. What song are you queuing up? I am cueing up “Girls On Film” by Duran Duran. Wow. Wow. Duran Duran, I’m back in college. Yeesh. Michelle Cottle, Jamelle, thank you both so much for coming on the show this convention week, and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future. Yeah, thank you, guys. Thank you for having us. Meanwhile, Michelle Goldberg and I will be back next week. That’s our show for this week. Thank you all for listening.

I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist for The Times since 2011, but my career with the newspaper stretches back to 1995 and includes many twists and turns that reflect my embarrassingly scattered interests. I covered Congress, the White House and several political campaigns; I also spent five years in the role of chief restaurant critic. As the Rome bureau chief, I reported on the Vatican; as a staff writer for The Times’s Sunday magazine, I wrote many celebrity profiles. That jumble has informed my various books, which focus on the Roman Catholic Church, George W. Bush, my strange eating life, the college admissions process and meatloaf. Politically, I’m grief-stricken over the way President Trump has governed and I’m left of center, but I don’t think that the center is a bad place or “compromise” a dirty word. I’m Italian-American, I’m gay and I write a weekly Times newsletter in which you’ll occasionally encounter my dog, Regan, who has the run of our Manhattan apartment. @FrankBruni I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter. @michelleinbklyn “The Argument” is a production of The New York Times Opinion section.
