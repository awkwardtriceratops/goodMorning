By Emma G. Fitzsimmons The developers behind Industry City, a major commercial project in Brooklyn that aimed to create 20,000 jobs, have abandoned their rezoning proposal for the neighborhood, overcome by a swell of opposition from the progressive left. The fight over Industry City was the biggest clash over development in New York City since the collapse of the Amazon deal in Queens last year, and the proposal’s defeat reflects the growing strength of progressive Democrats. The rezoning application had been cast as a way to bring jobs to an underdeveloped waterfront industrial area, and the city’s massive job losses during the pandemic gave supporters of the rezoning a compelling argument that the city could not spurn the prospect of new jobs. But the developers decided to withdraw the application on Tuesday night after more elected officials came out against the plan. “If a project like this can’t succeed, it concerns me very much about the future of New York City — a place I’ve spent my whole life,” the chief executive of Industry City, Andrew Kimball, said in an interview on Wednesday.
