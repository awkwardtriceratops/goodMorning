Meanwhile, a representative in Brooklyn may lose to a first-time candidate and QAnon supporter. By Ginia Bellafante On Saturday afternoon, as the champagne virtually uncorked itself in New York City in celebration of what looked like the end of Trumpism, an alternate history was unfolding in the southern stretches of Brooklyn. A Republican named Mark Szuszkiewicz was leading in a race against an incumbent for a State Assembly seat in and around Coney Island that had been held by a Democrat for decades. The current representative, a Haitian-American named Mathylde Frontus, had run a social-services agency she founded, fighting for the poor and disabled. Mr. Szuszkiewicz was a real estate agent whose support extended incongruously to tax credits for organic farmers and mandatory life-skills training in public schools (because too many people “don’t know what a Phillips-head screwdriver is,” he said in a debate). He also seemed to be a QAnon follower. It was not money that pushed such an unusual candidacy forward. On the contrary, Mr. Szuszkiewicz raised about $1,400 — less than what it might cost to buy a 15-year-old Subaru. Ms. Frontus fared marginally better — she brought in close to $9,500, according to the state’s Board of Elections, with top donations coming from people who shared the last name Frontus. Presented with a contest between an incumbent holding four graduate degrees — including a doctorate from Columbia — and a candidate sympathetic to a fantasy alleging world domination by a chain of Satanist pedophiles extending from Georgetown to Santa Monica, you would think that New Yorkers beyond the district might have opened their checkbooks in the name of proven competence and clarity. But their attention was focused elsewhere. They were long into a delirious bender pouring piles of money into high-profile Senate races around the country, some of them predictably unwinnable. Political giving, as with so much else in life, is driven as much by emotion and a vague sense of status proximity as it is by ideology and a practical calculus. Liberals have spent the past four years consumed by rage, and nothing motivates quite like fury, which demands no accounting of logic. As it happened, three ZIP codes on the Upper West Side sent more than $1.5 million in single, itemized donations to the doomed Democratic Senate campaigns of Amy McGrath in Kentucky, who was a long shot to defeat Mitch McConnell, and Jaime Harrison, who was unlikely to overtake Lindsey Graham in South Carolina. That donors gravitate toward the excitement is another dimension of the psychology. They don’t want to trawl local cable-access channels to find their candidates, Brad Hoylman, a New York State senator, told me. “They want to see Rachel Maddow talking about them.”
