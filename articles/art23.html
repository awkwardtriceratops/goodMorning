The 2020 Republican convention is looking strangely like the 1992 edition. By Jennifer Senior Opinion Columnist The Republican convention at last begins this week, and much of it will be virtual, which makes it very 2020. Yet as strange as it is to say — and bear with me here — something about this moment brings to mind the Republican convention of 1992. Does anyone remember that dark pageant of apocalyptica? The parallel circumstances are worth noting. Like Donald Trump, George H.W. Bush was a Republican incumbent with pitiful approval ratings and terrible poll numbers compared with his moderate challenger (then a young Arkansas governor named Bill Clinton); like Trump, Bush presided over a nation scarred and exhausted by a recession. They were very different men, Trump and Bush. A decades-long public servant, Bush believed in international alliances and the power of our institutions; he was a hard worker, a courteous colleague, a modest fellow — the superego to Trump’s id, the string trio to Trump’s death metal band. But he always had a goon squad on hand to fire up the party’s base of religious conservatives and social reactionaries, which lived in a curious coalition with the party’s elite cadre of internationalists seeking lower taxes. In 1988, he got himself elected thanks in large part to a race-baiting campaign ad. And in 1992, knowing he didn’t have a cheerful economic message to peddle, he turned over his convention to the socially conservative wing of his party, in the vain hope he could energize those same core supporters. The convention devolved into an atom-splitting culture war. Speakers decried the dangers of radical feminists (Hillary!). The evils of socialism (Bill wanted health care for all). The depredation of the “homosexual rights movement.” Ted Kennedy was their Bernie. H.R.C. was their A.O.C. The Los Angeles riots — also sparked by a videotaped act of police brutality — were today’s civil unrest.
