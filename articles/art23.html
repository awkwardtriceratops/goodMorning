Life With Severe Autism
By Amy S.F. Lutz “I see only hands,” Amy S. F. Lutz writes. “One wrapped over Jonah’s fist, another under his jaw to keep him from biting, another untangling my hair from his fingers, one intercepting before he could yank another necklace off my neck. … I never had enough hands.”
 The author is trying to safely defuse her severely autistic son, in the midst of one of the rages that once consumed him. Jonah, now 21, is not “quirky.” Nor is he an “indigo” child possessed of extraordinary and mysterious abilities. He is an affectionate young man who loves his parents, his four younger siblings, pretzels with cheese sauce and the kind of roller coaster rides that make the rest of us hurl. He also needs to be watched every minute of every day. Left to his own devices he will run away, or perhaps flush his iPad down the toilet when it needs to be recharged. He has few words. Though he can write and “decode” text, he doesn’t really comprehend. He required almost a year of hospitalization for his violent outbursts, and maintenance electroconvulsive therapy to quell his rapidly cycling bipolar disorder. When he was younger he might have tried to attack you, or himself. His family loves him deeply. Jonah is at the center of Lutz’s “We Walk: Life With Severe Autism.” (He’s a dude who loves to be in motion, but given the unknowables of his world to his family, the title also evokes II Corinthians 5:7: “We walk by faith, not by sight.”) Yet this extraordinary and thought-provoking series of essays is not really about him, or even about his family. It’s about us. Lutz is asking us to consider a question fundamental to a decent society: Can we take the most vulnerable among us and give them a place at the table? “We Walk” manages to be both heartwarming and cerebral. Lutz asks a whole bunch of questions — questions that I, as the mother of a far less affected but still dependent autistic son, wrestle with daily: Can a profoundly intellectually disabled person have a relationship to God? What is friendship to her son — and can it include the myriad people paid to care for him? Does the language we use to talk about disability matter? Are coercive treatments like electroconvulsive therapy, applied behavioral analysis and physically guided feeding (Lutz needed to take Jonah for professional help because he ate only pretzels and peanut butter) traumatizing, or a sometimes painful path to a better future? There is always someone around who is happy to argue the inarguable, and nowhere is this more true than in various factions of the disability movement. Deaf people who opt to get cochlear implants because it’s easier to live in this world with hearing are labeled traitors to deaf culture. Small people who opt for painful limb lengthening because they would like to be able to comb their own hair or wipe their own bottoms are called — as Tiffanie DiDonato was called in her memoir, “Dwarf” — sellouts. And when it comes to autism, the neurodiversity movement has a message for you: Autism is merely an alternative way of seeing the world, and don’t you dare say otherwise. The argument at the heart of neurodiversity, popularized in Steve Silberman’s “NeuroTribes” and promulgated in groups like the Thinking Person’s Guide to Autism and Autistic Self Advocacy Network, is that autism isn’t a disease at all, but rather a different way of seeing the world. To the portion of autistic men and women who are capable of autonomy, self-expression and self-awareness, that is absolutely true. Writers like John Elder Robison, Thomas Clements and Maxfield Sparrow have written eloquently about both the beauty and pain of navigating the world with their differences.
