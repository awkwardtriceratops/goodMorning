Teams<br></h1><p id="artcont">Making sure livestreams don’t lag. Sending out remote video kits. Showing speakers how to avoid microphone mishaps. Digital planners for the conventions have suddenly become all-important. By Nick Corasaniti A political convention is traditionally the work of thousands — event planners and security workers, camera operators and stage managers, handlers and groomers, even an inflation team for the ceremonial balloon drop on the nominee. But with the coronavirus sequestering delegates to living rooms and reducing the raucous arena to a pixelated party of (very roughly) like-minded politicos, the most critical staff members for this year’s nearly all-virtual convention are the ones who often operate behind the scenes, away from the stage, in front of small screens: The digital team. For the Democratic National Convention, their work has meant building a network capable of expanding from a dozen or so remote feeds to hundreds; ensuring a livestream has enough redundancy to offset any lags or other problems; constructing a broadcast to recreate some semblance of a reactive audience; and organizing a coaching team for speakers and participants to mitigate, as much as possible, any embarrassing Zoom-mutes or microphone mishaps. “With the pandemic, an inability for people to travel and really share experiences together, we had to reach out and go from a small number of remotes to hundreds of remotes,” said Andrew Binns, the chief innovation officer of the Democratic National Convention. While a devastating pandemic was not on the convention’s initial list of potential disasters heading into 2020, Mr. Binns has been preparing for an event like this for years. Having worked on the digital team since former Vice President Al Gore accepted the party’s nomination in 2000, Mr. Binns has often planned for the worst — be it a hurricane, an earthquake or some other catastrophic event — by building out a secure and reliable network of a dozen remote video links and a few spare video kits. Should organizers ever need to conduct the actual convention remotely, Mr. Binns could quickly dispatch a spider web of streams to recreate the convention online. This year, both have grown exponentially. TRANSCRIPT “I accept —” “— your nomination —” “— for president —” “— of the United States.” [cheers and applause] The conventions. “It’s when a lot of people start taking the race seriously.” “I’ve been to pretty much every convention since 1988.” “Read my lips.” “Normally, a convention is wild.” But in 2020, things are a little different. “The pandemic has changed virtually every aspect of the 2020 campaign.” “I think it’s defining the election. And I think you’re seeing that in the way they’re approaching the conventions.” “You could say that it has caused a reckoning about, do political conventions even matter at all? Can’t we just do this whole process without them?” So, how did the conventions grow to the spectacles they are today? “What do you mean, ‘shut up’?” And what will this year hold? “Conventions have been around for about a century in various forms.” “1944: The Democratic Convention in Chicago, Illinois, lifted the roof.” “I mean, it used to be, like, you’d have these really dramatic nomination fights.” “I feel absolutely confident that, in this convention, I’m going to be the winner.” “And floor fights.” “I don’t care!” “Keep your hands off of me!” “And things about platform and who should be allowed. The networks used to give these things around-the-clock attention, gavel to gavel. And most of that stuff is gone.” Over time, the process evolved. And now candidates are chosen based on the results of primaries and caucuses, so there aren’t many surprises. “And what has happened to the conventions is they have become this sort of four-night advertisement for the candidates —” “Thank you.” “— and their parties.” “If you believe that we must be fierce and relentless and terminate terrorism, then you are a Republican.” [cheers] But generally, that format hasn’t really changed. “The critique of conventions is that they’re just kind of like a dinosaur.” [music, Los Del Rio, “Macarena”] “They’re a relic of a past age of politics.” The challenge for campaigns this year — “Good afternoon, everybody.” — is how to pack in substance and excitement virtually. “How do you do a convention in the midst of a pandemic?” “The campaigns have really struggled to carry on since the pandemic.” “Good morning.” “Joe Biden is a helpless puppet —” “In contrast to Trump’s desire to keep campaigning, Biden has been at home, for the most part.” “The Democratic Party has approached the convention and Covid —” “Hey, good evening, Tampa.” “— much more conservatively, small C, than the Republican Party.” “We saved millions of lives. And now, it’s time to open up, get back to work, OK?” So what is actually going to happen? Well, the plan has changed — a lot. “The Democrats had hoped to have a big, splashy convention in Milwaukee. Then the virus intervened.” So the Democrats went to an almost entirely virtual convention. “And we ultimately received the call that even Joe Biden would not actually be traveling to Milwaukee to give his speech in person.” Instead, now all speakers, including Biden, will deliver their addresses from around the country. And the R.N.C.? “The Republicans had hoped to hold the convention in Charlotte, North Carolina.” But after North Carolina required masks and social distancing rules, the R.N.C. moved the main events to Jacksonville. Then cases spiked in Florida. “I looked at my team, and I said, ‘The timing for this event is not right.’” So now, they’ll be mostly virtual as well. And Trump will give his speech accepting the party nomination from Washington, D.C. “The challenge for both of these conventions is, what can you do to engage the American electorate that is already very tired of sitting on Zooms all day? What can you do to ensure that they tune in anyway and get energized?” “— is Jimmy Carter and I’m running for president.” “In terms of presenting the candidate to the nation, there are two moments to watch. One’s the roll call.” “We’re now prepared to call the roll of the state.” “Roll call vote!” This is where the delegates formally nominate the candidate. “California casts 33-and- one-half votes for Kennedy.” “And it’s kind of corny, but it’s kind of cool. But it’s kind of corny.” “75 votes for President George W. Bush!” “This year, I guess, it’ll be a Zoom call. And the other is the speech.” “Extremism in the defense of liberty —” “Let us build a peace.” “Let me be the bridge to an America that only the unknowing call myth.” “This is the biggest audience they will have for their pitch to Americans.” “The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation —” “This is their chance to lay out their vision for the future of the country.” “— I alone can fix it.” This year, Biden and Trump will give these speeches to, well, primarily a TV camera. “Giving a speech without an audience and without having a constant loop of audience feedback does look poised to present a challenge for both of the presidential contenders.” So are there any potential benefits to this? “One of the sort of benefits of the pandemic is that people in, well, a lot of the country are still locked at home. The question is, Are you going to watch reruns of ‘The Sopranos,’ or are you going to watch the convention?” “I think there’s a lot of fear and a lot of interest. And people really want to know how these different leaders are going to lead us through this pandemic and through the economic crisis that accompanied it.” But there’s also potentially a whole lot of downside. “You lose the energy that, presumably, you send delegates out into the world with to begin the fall campaign.” “For the president, what he’s missing out on is showing off this contrast from four years ago, when there was a lot of dissent against him.” “Stand and speak and vote your conscience.” “He would be able to show that, four years later, the party is in lockstep with him.” “They don’t call it Super Tuesday for nothing!” “Joe Biden is missing these big moments that would show someone who has struggled to look like a real candidate with a lot of enthusiasm behind him.” “Just this morning we heard we won Maine as well.” “Yeah, right!” So is it time to rethink conventions altogether? “I think the conventions matter less this year than ever — partly because neither one of them is happening in a normal way, but also because this election seems more than anything to be a referendum about Donald Trump. It’s really Donald Trump against Donald Trump.” “You’re fired! Get out!” “We’re just getting started.” And don’t expect the rest of the campaign to resume any sort of normalcy soon. “Historically, the conventions do mark the beginning of a really intense general election campaign cycle. But the subsequent activities after the convention — door-to-door engaging of those voters, how those voters actually cast their ballots — all of that is set to look extraordinarily different this year.” “So, we are in my tiny, postage stamp-sized backyard in Washington.” “We’re in my backyard in Hollywood, California.” “And I am currently at home in New York City, about to head to Delaware.” “It’s very hot. It’s very buggy. But we’re making the best of it.” “Hi. I’m Sarah Kerr, the producer of this video. We spent weeks looking back through footage of old conventions and learning how they might be different this year. Now, they’re finally here. And they’re definitely going to be unconventional. Check out nytimes.com every night for live video and analysis. We’ll see you there.” They have gone to some of the premier speakers as well as some delegates and Democratic Party superfans. They come with a lighting rig, microphones and a camera with a pre-established connection to the main video feed. Helping recipients set them up required some challenging video chats, but by Friday they were all in place. The goal is to film these Democrats’ living-room reactions and splice them in live during a major speech. Officials emphasize that the bar isn’t cinematic quality but rather more of a selfie-cam view, hoping that a bit more intimacy actually breeds electricity (think of the montages of sports fans celebrating a game-winning goal or play). That, of course, still required a bit of coaching. So for the past three or so weeks, a digital team led by Lindsay Holst, one of the convention czars, has been working with participants to prepare them for a digital experience. “We’ve set up a series of distribution channels that we’ve been getting people acclimated to using over the course of the past few weeks, for which we can share content in real time but also solicit content from them in real time,” Ms. Holst said. She offered some examples of instructions to participant audiences: “So send us a video of yourself cheering, responding to a given speech. Here’s a downloadable social graphic that looks just like one of the signs you might see somebody holding up in a normal year on the floor of the arena, but now we’re posting it from social.” “And our hope is, you know, this is how people will participate now from wherever they are,” she said. Kristin Urquiza will be one of those participants. Before the pandemic hit, she said, she would have just watched the convention from her living room in Arizona. But now she’ll be giving a speech on Monday night in prime time — also from her living room. “It’s different than going in the studio or meeting up with someone somewhere,” Ms. Urquiza said. But, she said, delivering a speech remotely is important to underscoring the necessary steps to take to beat the coronavirus. She received one of the camera kits from the D.N.C., which also came with tutorial videos showing how to deliver a speech from the comfort of her own home. Her partner played production manager as they set up the rig. “I’m an old millennial,” said Ms. Urquiza, 39. “So I’m not completely outside of the tech universe. It wasn’t completely foreign to me to use the technology, but there were some helpful tutorial videos that they provided to be able to help set up and it was super easy and user-friendly. Not like putting together Ikea furniture.” For the Republican National Convention team, the goal is the same, but they have a bit more to work with. Though there will not be thousands of screaming delegates and elected officials parading the floors of the convention hall, 336 delegates will gather, socially distanced, in the spacious Charlotte Convention Center in Charlotte, N.C., for the official nomination process. The goal of the Republican team is to capture enough energy from the hundreds of delegates to energize the millions of people watching, and make the convention feel somewhat special for the thousands of delegates who cannot attend. “Most of those are the most engaged members,” said Max Everett, the chief innovation officer of the Republican National Convention. “They’re really the ones missing out, so there is a bit of pressure on that so they can at least see what’s going on.” Of course, the Republican and Democratic National Conventions have been expanding their digital offerings since the early 2000s, when keynote speeches were confined to buffering bits on a RealPlayer video. But never before has so much of the convention experience itself been funneled and reconstructed in a livestream, and never has protecting that livestream been more important. Both Mr. Binns and Mr. Everett said they had built upon existing network plans and worked with partners like Amazon and Google to ensure the security of the streams from any bad actors, foreign or domestic. “Everything in cybersecurity is risk mitigation,” Mr. Everett said. “We have backups to our backups to make sure that we have multiple ways to make sure that everyone can see it.” He added, “We do a ton of redundancy, diversity in our planning to make sure that we can handle anything that gets thrown at us.” Conventions are as much a media spectacle as they are an arena-size jamboree. And though the broadcast coverage will largely remain the same, the expected online viewership spike has expanded the possible partners. For the Democratic convention, that led organizers to tap the hip-hop show “Behind the Rhyme,” which is broadcast on Twitch, another extremely popular livestreaming platform, to do the exclusive convention-sponsored preshow. Another staple of the D.N.C., the concerts, will also happen virtually. With John Legend and Common on the marquee, it is possible a full remote performance is in the works, given their past collaboration on the song “Glory” from the movie “Selma.” But on that detail, the digital team, and Democratic officials, had a single message: Wait and see. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
