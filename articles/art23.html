By Alan Blinder, Karen Crouse and Bill Pennington RIGHT NOW Dustin Johnson remains at 17-under through nine holes. He holds a two-stroke lead over Cameron Smith. AUGUSTA, Ga. — Someone will slip on one of Augusta National Golf Club’s green jackets on Sunday as the champion of a Masters tournament that the coronavirus pandemic delayed by seven months. Dustin Johnson will enter the final round at 16 under par, giving him a commanding four-shot lead. But there is a far tighter competition just below him on the leaderboard. Abraham Ancer, Sungjae Im and Cameron Smith, all at 12 under par, are tied for second. Dylan Frittelli is behind them by a shot, just as Justin Thomas trails Frittelli by the same margin. Augusta National officials expect that the tournament will be decided by midafternoon, far earlier than usual because of scheduled N.F.L. games which follow the TV broadcast on CBS. When people say the Masters begins on the back nine Sunday, what they mean is the stretch of holes from No. 12 to No. 16, which include the two par-5s on the second nine (No. 13 and No. 15) and the wicked water-protected par-3 12th. The leader, Dustin Johnson, played those holes in 5-under during the first three rounds. His nearest challenger, Cameron Smith, who pulled to within two of Johnson through nine holes, has played them in 7-under.
