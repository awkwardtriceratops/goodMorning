By John Koblin RIGHT NOW “Succession,” HBO’s operatic depiction of a feuding media dynasty, won best drama series. “Succession,” HBO’s chronicle of a treacherous, ultra-rich media dynasty, won best drama series at the 72nd Emmy Awards on Sunday. It was the fifth time in the last six years that HBO has taken television’s most prestigious prize. The HBO drama also won awards for Jeremy Strong’s performance as the show’s tortured scion, as well as writing for the show’s creator, Jesse Armstrong. Going into the ceremony, Netflix, HBO’s main rival for Emmy gold, had more nominations than any other outlet. But HBO won more awards than any other network or streaming platform, thanks, in part, to the awards it picked up in the limited-series category for “Watchmen.” Regina King, who plays the masked hero in the series, won in the best actress category, her fourth Emmy Award. “Watchmen,” adapted by Damon Lindelof from a graphic novel, took on socially relevant topics like white supremacy and police brutality, won best limited series. John Oliver’s “Last Week Tonight,” an HBO stalwart that has been consistently critical of President Trump, took the best variety talk series for a fifth straight year. And in one of the night’s biggest surprises, Zendaya won best actress in a drama for her role in HBO’s drug-fueled series, “Euphoria.” HBO’s triumphs aside, the night was arguably stolen by the big-hearted Canadian comedy “Schitt’s Creek,” a show that had its final episode in April. The series, created by Daniel Levy created with his father, the actor and writer Eugene Levy, won all the comedy awards during the Sunday telecast. The comedy sweep was an Emmys first, according to a Television Academy spokesman. Ratings for “Schitt’s Creek” audience started small when the show made its debut in 2015 and did not grow until Netflix started streaming its past seasons a few years ago. That was one of few bright spots for Netflix for the night. The streaming service with 193 million subscribers worldwide has been nominated for best drama for eight consecutive years — and once again ended up without a win in the category. It was also shut out for the top comedy honors, with not enough academy voters going for “Dead to Me” and “The Kominsky Method.” “Schitt’s Creek” dominated the first hour of the Emmys broadcast, and its cast members got plenty of screen time as they celebrated during a viewing party in Toronto, not far from where they show is made. Daniel Levy, the 37-year-old writer, actor and director who created the show with his father, Eugene Levy, won four Emmys: for writing, directing, best supporting actor and for best comedy. “Oh no, oh no,” Levy said, as he accepted the Emmy for best supporting actor, his third of the night. “The internet’s about to turn on me. I’m so sorry.” The show’s stars — the longtime colleagues Catherine O’Hara and Eugene Levy — won best acting in a comedy honors for their husband-and-wife roles on the show.  The Emmy wins were their first since the early 1980s, when they were honored for their writing on the groundbreaking comedy series “SCTV.” O’Hara thanked the Levys for giving her the chance “to play a woman of a certain age — my age — who fully gets to be her ridiculous self.” Few series have ever swept best comedy and top acting honors in the same year, including “30 Rock,” “All in the Family” and “The Dick Van Dyke Show.” To round it out for program’s fictional Rose family, Annie Murphy won for best supporting actress in a comedy, too. Daniel Levy’s four wins represented the biggest haul for anyone during the Emmys’ prime-time telecast, a spokesman for the Television Academy said. “Watchmen,” an ambitious adaptation of a graphic novel from the veteran producer Damon Lindelof that addressed police brutality and white supremacy, won in the category of best limited series. Regina King, the show’s masked hero, won best actress in a limited series, her fourth Emmy win. In her acceptance speech, King implored viewers to vote in the coming election and paid tribute to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice who died Friday. She delivered her remarks while wearing a T-shirt that honored Breonna Taylor, a Black medical technician in Louisville, Ky., who was killed by police in March. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who portrays King’s husband on the show, won for best supporting actor in a limited series. And Lindelof and Cord Jefferson won for best writing in a limited series for their work on the series. It wasn’t a complete sweep for “Watchmen.” Uzo Aduba, who played Shirley Chisholm in “Mrs. America,” FX and Hulu’s chronicle of the feminist movement (and counter-movement) in the 1970s, won best supporting actress in a limited series. It was the third Emmy for Ms. Aduba. The 72nd Emmy Awards on Sunday looked nothing like the earlier ceremonies celebrating the year’s achievements in television and streaming because of the pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 Americans this year. Red carpet? Canceled. Actors seated shoulder to shoulder in an auditorium as the envelopes are unsealed? Nope. Jimmy Kimmel kicked off the ceremony from a nearly empty Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. “Welcome to the Pand-Emmys,” he said. In the opening moments, he appeared to deliver his jokes to a live audience — but it was just footage of crowds from past broadcasts that made it seem as if Oprah Winfrey, Michael Douglas and Jon Hamm were laughing at his remarks. Kimmel eventually gave up the bit to reveal that he was facing empty seats, some of them filled with cardboard cutouts of television stars. “Of course we don’t have an audience,” he said. “This isn’t a MAGA rally.” More than 100 nominees watched his monologue — and would soon broadcast themselves — from far-flung locations ranging from Berlin to Fayetteville, Ga. In an effort to make the broadcast go as smoothly as possible, the Television Academy had sent a kit to each nominee with instructions on how to put together a D.I.Y. studio. It came complete with a ring light, a microphone, a laptop and a camera. Several presenters and entertainers — including Jennifer Aniston, Tracee Ellis Ross and Jason Bateman — joined the host on a stage built above the Staples Center basketball court. The show was moved from its usual spot, the Microsoft Theater, to the home of the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers, because the arena has the technological wherewithal to accommodate dozens of remote feeds. It seemed to have worked: Though video quality ranged from very high to low, there were few technical glitches. ABC and the Television Academy are hoping that the makeshift quality boost interest in an awards night that has grown stale in recent years. Despite a boom in scripted entertainment, ratings for the Emmys have declined sharply. The show drew 6.9 million viewers last year, a low. And on Sunday it faced competition from “Sunday Night Football,” and the N.B.A. playoffs. 
In one of the night’s biggest surprises, Zendaya won best actress in a drama for her role in HBO’s “Euphoria.” What did it take to get there? She had to beat an Oscar winner, Olivia Colman (“The Crown”), a four-time Emmy winner, Laura Linney (“Ozark”), a major TV star, Jennifer Aniston (“The Morning Show”), last year’s best actress winner, Jodie Comer (“Killing Eve”), and the perennial Emmy contender, Sandra Oh (also from “Killing Eve”) ”There is hope in the young people out there,” Zendaya said in her acceptance speech. “I know that our TV show doesn’t always feel like a great example of that, but there is hope in young people.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
