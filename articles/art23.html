By Catie Edmondson, Nicholas Fandos, Alan Rappeport, Luke Broadwater and Emily Cochrane A defiant Louis DeJoy, under tough questioning from Democrats, defended the cost-cutting measures he put in place as postmaster general and rejected suggestions that the changes were intended to influence the 2020 election by making mail-in voting less reliable. “I am not engaged in sabotaging the election,” an increasingly exasperated Mr. DeJoy told Democrats. “We will do everything in our power and structure to deliver the ballots on time.” Mr. DeJoy, a megadonor to President Trump, is embroiled in a political firestorm as recent changes aimed at reducing the Postal Service’s costs — including cutting overtime and limiting trips — have led to delays in mail delivery, including medicine, pension checks and bills. That has fueled concerns about whether the service will be able to handle what is expected to be a record number of mail-in ballots for the 2020 election. Mr. DeJoy, at times shouting over his Democratic questioners, criticized the “false narrative” that he said was being promoted about both his intentions and the changes, which he described as necessary to address the Postal Service’s financial woes but that civil rights groups, state attorneys general and Democrats have derided as an attempt to disenfranchise voters. Mr. DeJoy told House lawmakers that he did not put in place many of the changes that had caused concern — including the removal of blue mailboxes and mail-sorting machines — but said he did not know who ordered those operational changes. He acknowledged that some of the changes he had implemented, such as reducing overtime and limiting trips, had caused delays but said those were necessary and issues that arose from them were being rectified. “Transitions don’t always go smoothly,” he said, adding that while “we are very concerned with the deterioration in service, we’re seeing a big recovery this week.” As the hearing wore on, and Mr. DeJoy found himself being asked to tread the same ground again and again, he appeared to grow weary of trying to prove that his intentions were good. His decision to cut down on late and extra shipments of mail was based on a “fundamental, basic principle: Run your trucks on time.” “I would not know how to reverse that now,” he said. “Am I to say do not run the trucks on time? Is that the answer that we are trying to get me to say here today?” Pressed by Representative John Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, to put in writing his assurances to get mail service, including mail-in ballots, moving on time, Mr. DeJoy said he would commit to giving the Oversight committee “an update on the improvement of the service” by next Monday.
