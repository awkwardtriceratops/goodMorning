Slotnik [Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Tuesday. Tune into a live Election Day broadcast of “The Daily” from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. Weather: Chance of an early shower, then mixed sun and clouds. Blustery, with a high around 50. Alternate-side parking: Suspended today for Election Day. It’s Election Day, and two presidential candidates are nearing the finish line of a contentious campaign season shaped by the pandemic, a sharp economic downturn and recurring protests over racial injustice. In New York State, the polls are open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. For the first time in the state, early voting was offered in a presidential election, and over 1.1 million people in New York City took advantage of it. Many people endured long lines and cold rain to cast their vote over the past week, while others mailed in their ballots or dropped them off at poll sites. There are no statewide contests, but races for the House, State Senate, State Assembly and local offices will be decided. Here’s what you should know: This city website will tell you where to vote, based on your address. The basic voting process has changed little: Check in at your poll site, fill in your ballot and then slip it into a machine. Then pick up your “I Voted” sticker. But for coronavirus safety at polling places, face masks will be required, and will be provided for voters who need them; markers will encourage social distancing, also required; voters will get styluses that double as pens, which they can keep, to fill out ballots; and voting machines will be regularly cleaned with antiseptic wipes. If you have a mail-in ballot, you can put it in a drop box at your poll site or deliver it to the office of your local board of elections. Few races have garnered as much attention as the one between Representative Max Rose and Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, who are seeking to represent the House district that represents Staten Island and part of southern Brooklyn, and is the most conservative in the city. The contest is the G.O.P.’s only realistic chance to pick up a congressional seat in the five boroughs. Also of note is Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s re-election campaign, which has become one of the most expensive House races in the country even though she will almost certainly win. Some races elsewhere also bear watching: In two House races on Long Island and one in Central New York, Republican incumbents may fall to Democratic challengers.

Many races will be called on election night, but across the country the increase in mail voting because of the pandemic is expected to delay the full results. In New York, only unofficial results from in-person early and Election Day voting will be released on election night, according to my colleagues at The Upshot. Absentee ballots will be reported in the following days and weeks, depending on the county. It took weeks to finish counting ballots for the June primary. New Yorkers are bracing for possible unrest no matter who wins the presidency. Storefronts have been boarded up in the best-known shopping areas and, to a lesser extent, in other commercial districts. Tensions have already flared in Manhattan, where on Sunday police officers clashed with protesters who had gathered to confront supporters of President Trump.

The Mini Crossword: Here is today’s puzzle. The police said a woman thought to have jumped to her death in Queens was thrown from her sixth-floor apartment by her boyfriend. [Daily News] Wind knocked out power for over 2,000 people across New York City and Westchester County, and wreaked havoc on some outdoor dining setups. [Gothamist] Forty-eight artists designed “I Voted” stickers for everyone who wants one (like those who voted by mail). [New York magazine ] The Times’s Lauren Messman writes: New Yorkers commuting through the Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center subway station will find it transformed with vibrant portraits of Black, Asian and Pacific Islander people along with anti-discriminatory messages like “I did not make you sick” and “I am not your scapegoat.” The series is the work of the neuroscientist turned artist Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya (pronounced PING-bodee-bak-ee-ah). In August, Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya was named a New York City Public Artist in Residence through a program that has partnered artists with city agencies since 2015. She is one of two artists currently embedded with the city’s Commission on Human Rights. Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya’s “I Believe in Our City” series was created as a response to a grim statistic. From February to September, the commission received more than 566 reports of discrimination, harassment and bias related to Covid-19 — 184 of which were anti-Asian in nature. It’s a troubling spike not just appearing in New York, but in Asian-American communities across the country. “My goal with this art series was to turn these hurts into something beautiful and powerful,” Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya said in a phone interview. She added, “I really wanted to find a way to say, despite everything we have faced as Asian-Americans and New Yorkers, that I still believe in New York.” The series of 45 pieces will be displayed in the subway station through Dec. 2. It’s Tuesday — don’t stop believing. Dear Diary: I live alone in an apartment that used to be two apartments that were legally combined over 20 years ago. This year, the Census Bureau sent me two forms, one for each apartment. I called and asked for guidance on how to fill them out. After explaining my dilemma to a number of people, I decided to write that there was one occupant in the part of the apartments where I sleep and zero occupants in the other part. Then I mailed back the forms. A short time later, I encountered a young man in the hallway on my floor on a Friday afternoon. He told me that he was with the Census Bureau and that he was there to find out who lived in the apartment that I had listed as having no occupants. I explained my dilemma to him. He said my situation did not fit any in his template and that his supervisor had been no help. The next day, a young woman rang my bell. She said she was from the Census Bureau and that she was there to find out who lived in my apartment. I told my story again. She could not solve the problem either. I can’t wait to see who rings my doorbell next. — Marcia Weiser New York Today is published weekdays around 6 a.m. Sign up here to get it by email. You can also find it at nytoday.com.
