They are struggling to stay alive until indoor dining returns. By Sharon Otterman A dozen people were waiting in line when Imani in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, opened for brunch on a recent Saturday morning. That evening, diners packed the sidewalk tables at Anton’s, a cafe and wine bar in Greenwich Village. In Jackson Heights, Queens, two restaurants across the street from each other, Angel Indian and Phayul Himalayan, put out outdoor seating and were eagerly awaiting customers. Restaurants, a pillar of life in New York City, were devastated by the pandemic shutdown, and the move to allow outdoor dining has provided a tenuous lifeline for the business and a boon to residents desperate for a sliver of normalcy. Nearly 10,000 restaurants have set up outdoor seating since July, even as the ban on indoor service continues. Still, the industry is in crisis. Though outdoor dining has been a hit with patrons, restaurant owners said they were operating at a fraction of regular seating capacity. Many are staying open only because of the federal paycheck protection program, which supports payroll, and because they have not paid their full rent in months. A local emergency law shields restaurant owners from personal liability for commercial leases. “It is very hard, hard times for me, I only survive here,” said Amritpal Singh, owner of Angel Indian in Queens, who spent $3,000 to upgrade his outdoor dining area. “It’s not like before.” Hanging in the balance is a vital New York City industry that before the pandemic employed more than 300,000 people, from recent immigrants to musicians, artists, writers and actors who help define the city as a cultural hub. Without them, New York City may become less of a destination, and more people may choose to live in other cities or the suburbs. Some 160,000 people in the bar and restaurant industry in the city remain out of work, according to July federal employment data, and nearly 1,300 restaurants closed permanently between March and July. During the week of Aug. 14, New York City restaurants were doing about 23 percent of last year’s volume in terms of people seated, according to reservation data from Resy, the reservation app used by many outdoor dining restaurants. That is still very low, but the week before that it was 18 percent. In mid-July it was 10 percent.
