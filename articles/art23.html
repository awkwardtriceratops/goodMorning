Official Is Accused of Drugging and Sexually Assaulting Women<br></h1><p id="artcont">He was not charged with any of the alleged assaults, but rather with two counts of lying when he was questioned by the F.B.I. By Benjamin Weiser A former United Nations official has been accused of drugging and sexually assaulting women while he was stationed in Iraq, Egypt and the United States, and lying to cover up the conduct, the authorities said. The former official, Karim Elkorany, would render his victims unconscious and, in at least one case in 2016, a victim was able to observe him assaulting her but was physically unable to stop him, according to a federal indictment unsealed on Wednesday. After the woman reported the assault to the U.N., the organization conducted an investigation and Mr. Elkorany resigned in 2018, the indictment said. The indictment, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, said Mr. Elkorany was accused of sexually assaulting or attempting to assault at least six women. However, he was not charged with any of the alleged assaults, but rather with two counts of lying when he was questioned by the F.B.I. in 2017. On Wednesday, he was arrested in New Jersey, where he lives, and was expected to appear before a federal magistrate judge, the authorities said. Mr. Elkorany, 37, worked in international aid, development and foreign relations positions with the U.N. from about 2005 until 2018, the indictment said. A lawyer for Mr. Elkorany could not immediately be reached for comment. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
