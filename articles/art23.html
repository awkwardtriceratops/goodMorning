By Michael Angelo Mr. Angelo is an artist and small-business owner. When I founded Michael Angelo’s Wonderland Beauty Parlor in the meatpacking district 15 years ago, I never imagined I would one day have to downsize and relocate to survive rising rents, only to have to then shut down for months. Nor could I conceive of having to choose between paying the rent on my apartment, paying the lease on the salon or putting food on the table. But at the peak of the summer, my partner and I were presented with a letter from our landlord demanding we pay months of back rent — the four months when my business was closed — or vacate our home in the neighborhood where I’ve lived and worked for two decades. As Diana Vreeland said, “There’s only one very good life, and that’s the life you know you want, and you make it yourself.” My life is in New York. So after months of patience, I finally received enough unemployment to move into a more affordable apartment. The rent, the lease and dinner are finally paid. For now.
