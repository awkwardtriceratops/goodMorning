As parents, we spend half our time marveling at what our kid can do and half pulling out our hair because the little monster used a toilet brush to draw a mural in the den. If you’ve ever wondered what’s happening in those wonderful, hectic little heads, researchers have a few classic experiments designed to observe exactly how young brains develop. We asked experts in cognitive development to demonstrate these experiments, using their own children as their subjects. The good news is you don’t even have to be a scientist to do them.

Pull up a chair, because whether you know it or not, you have a front-row seat to one of the most complicated and interesting mysteries in brain science: How does the human brain come to be the way it is? The Concept of ‘Conservation’
Few things in a child’s world are as precious as a pristine cookie. And, as many parents know, few things are as worthless as that same cookie once it’s broken and your kid is screaming “No, it’s ruined! I don’t want it!” While, yes, it may just be time for a nap, from his perspective, he’s right: The old cookie is gone.

“They’re crying because it’s not the same snack anymore,” said Stephanie Sitnick, an associate professor of psychology at Caldwell University in New Jersey. “And then you try to convince them, but now you have two pieces where before you only had one piece. And it doesn’t matter, because there’s no putting the cookie back together.”

Thanks to an odd quirk in the developing brain, small children can’t always understand that things can look different and still be the same. That concept is what child psychologists call “conservation.” And, it turns out, there is a very simple test you can do on your child to see how it works. First, a Little Background
The basic concept of conservation comes from Jean Piaget, the Albert Einstein of child psychology, who was a brilliant pioneer and whose ideas dominated the field for decades. He was interested in the predictable ways that children develop, often studying his own kids. It wasn’t just how we crawl before we walk, but how certain concepts seem totally alien to us until we hit a certain age.

For instance, he noticed that kids ages 2 to 7 have a tough time holding two ideas about a single thing in their head at the same time. A ball can be round and red, but it cannot also be flat — the flat ball is something else.

“To be able to hold both of those things constant in your mind while comparing it to something else, that’s a lot of internal manipulation that has to happen,” Dr. Sitnick said.

Scientists call this “centration,” the habit of focusing on one thing and ignoring all others. It’s no secret that kids rarely think of other people’s feelings, but centration is deeper than that. It deals with their inability to hold onto any two ideas about a single thing at the same time.

We asked Dr. Sitnick to demonstrate this idea in a simple, elegant experiment with her 4-year-old son, Elliot. It tested whether he could track two glasses of water that contained the same amount but looked different. (You can find the steps to re-create this experiment below.)  The
Experiment
You can do the conservation test with water, Play-Doh, bath bubbles, pennies, Legos or 1,000 other things around your house that can be molded or put into containers. Water is the easiest. Step 1:
Take two identical transparent glasses and put the same amount of water (or juice or milk) in them. Step 2:
Ask your child if they are, in fact, the same. Yes? Good. Step 3:
Pour all the water from one glass into either a shorter, fatter glass or a taller, skinnier one while the child watches. Step 4:
Ask the child if the taller one has more water or if they are equal. It’s important to explicitly offer “equal” as an option. If you just ask if the tall one has more, the child might blindly agree with you.

Children under the age of 7 will mostly say they are not the same, despite having watched you pour the water into the glass. When I did this with my son, he looked at me like I was an idiot. Of course there’s more in the tall glass, Daddy, it’s taller! Step 5:
Try it with other media. Two identical gobs of Play-Doh. Are they the same amount? Good. Now whack one flat. How about now? Get creative. Cut a cupcake in half. Stack pennies. See if their answers change. Why It Works
Don’t worry, your child isn’t dense. Conservation is not an idea you can teach or control. It’s just that their brain hasn’t yet developed the ability to hold different relevant observations about an object. A tall thing is bigger than a short one; a tall, skinny thing cannot be as big as a short fat one. While this offers a fun window into your child’s brain, it also explains a lot about their behavior.

Dr. Sitnick stressed that it’s not just that kids don’t comprehend, they pay attention to the world differently than adults.

For instance, Elliot says that Dr. Sitnick has “princess hair” when she lets it down but that she is not a princess with it up. Partly, that’s because he cannot hold the idea that his mom has both princess hair and non-princess hair.

“Now, Piaget never would have done a study on princess hair,” she said, but her kid is similarly “focusing on something it wouldn’t even occur to me to look at.”

The ability to understand that tall water and short water can be the same also translates to social development, which is Sitnick’s specialty. Just like Play-Doh, people can be two things at once — sad yet excited, angry yet content, frustrated yet happy. Which explains why adult behavior can be so mystifying to kids. However, even though she understands why kids don’t pass the conservation test, it’s always jarring to see it.

“It’s surprising every time. I mean, really? You didn’t get that right?” she said. “It’s just that internal representation, right? I’m focusing on this one aspect and I can’t focus on another.” Produced by Deanna Donegan. Video editing by Nick Sansone. lllustrations by Igor Bastidas(top) and Deanna Donegan(inline)
