Also: Better not to prosecute Donald Trump. To the Editor: Re “Trump Allies Got Medicine Unavailable to Others” (news article, Dec. 10): More abuses, privilege and deadly hypocrisy are exposed here for all who suspected that Donald Trump, Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani, among others in this “circle,” did not survive Covid in any ordinary way. It leaves me infuriated that they get special treatment while my daughter, who is eight months pregnant, would probably not receive these treatments if she contracted the virus because they are “rationed” and “cleared” for the growing circle of Donald Trump’s family, friends and staff members. Don’t wear masks; you will be saved! This would be shameful for people who are capable of shame. Ann Sparanese
Englewood, N.J. To the Editor: So Rudy Giuliani and Chris Christie get special treatment for Covid-19 because of their status and whom they know. Reminds me of a line from George Orwell’s “Animal Farm”: “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” Brant Thomas
Cold Spring, N.Y. To the Editor: As shown by several of the Dec. 9 letters in response to “Should Trump Be Prosecuted?” (Op-Ed, Nov. 28), many people feel that although Donald Trump deserves to be prosecuted, the need for political healing and reconciliation makes such prosecution a bad idea. Of course, there is merit to this. But one can’t help but think that with Joe Biden in office, Mr. Trump and his followers will continue to incite division and rancor even if Mr. Trump is shown the generosity of not being prosecuted. That would be a “lose-lose” outcome. John R. Lewis
