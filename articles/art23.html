Also: Californians at the Democratic National Convention. By Jill Cowan Good morning. We knew this was coming. A dry winter was likely to lead to an explosive fire season that starts early and lasts longer. Lots of rain the winter before that one means there’s lots to burn. The pandemic, we’ve seen over and over again, has made people who were already vulnerable even more so. Firefighting ranks — usually filled out with prisoners — have been stretched thin, and evacuation protocols complicated by the possible transmission of the coronavirus. [Read more about how climate change means that the worst of both worlds is in California’s long term forecast.] Experts have warned of these risks repeatedly. And yet, every order to evacuate, every video of a lurid orange fire line, every image of a smoldering house, of cars leaving a packed cul-de-sac, of smoke drifting over hundreds of miles of the Bay Area, feels at once like a flashback and another sucker punch to the gut. [Read the latest updates on the wildfires burning across California.] On Wednesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom addressed a beleaguered, weary state. He sounded not a little weary himself as he rattled off alarming statistics about the number of lightning strikes over the past three days (almost 11,000) — any one of which could have ignited a catastrophic blaze, particularly during a record-setting heat wave. They’ve sparked at least 367 active fires across the state, 23 of which are considered major, he said. He highlighted several complexes of lightning-sparked fires that have sent residents fleeing from Northern California communities that have been hammered by wildfires and power outages in recent years, including the CZU August Lightning Complex, the LNU Lightning Complex and the Carmel fire — none of which were at all contained as of his news conference. [Read more about how the state has prepared for wildfires in a pandemic.] Still, Mr. Newsom emphasized that California is painfully familiar with the challenges of a busy wildfire season, and officials have been bracing for months. “This is what the state does,” he said. Mr. Newsom added that he expected a flex alert on Monday to be the last in the immediate future. (This article is part of the California Today newsletter. Sign up to get it by email.)

At the same time, however, he emphasized that gains could easily be lost. And the state is preparing, he said, for a possible second wave in the fall. “We are keeping our eyes squarely on mitigating the spread of Covid-19,” he said. The fires this year are so widespread and are burning at just about the worst time possible: In the middle of a pandemic.
