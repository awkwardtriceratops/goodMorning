Gyms Can Reopen Under These New Rules<br></h1><p id="artcont">NEW YORK TODAY By Amanda Rosa [Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Tuesday. Weather: Patchy fog in the morning and then a slight chance of thunderstorms. Expect a high in the mid-80s. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Sept. 7 (Labor Day). Read about the amended regulations here. Get pumped, New York. Gyms, which have been closed in the state since mid-March to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, will be allowed to open again as soon as Monday and no later than Sept. 2, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has announced. But a quick gym workout won’t be back to normal anytime soon. Here’s what you need to know before you head to a health club to sweat off the “Quarantine 15.” Mr. Cuomo’s announcement came with some new rules. Gyms will be limited to a third of their capacity, and they need to maintain a sign-in sheet to help contact tracers in case of a virus outbreak. Air filters must be able to help prevent the transmission of viral particles. People must wear masks at all times (yes, even on the treadmill). It wasn’t immediately clear if gym owners would need to make other changes, like installing plexiglass barriers between machines. Local elected officials can stop gyms from holding indoor classes. In New York City, a City Hall spokesman said in a statement that indoor pools and fitness classes won’t be allowed to operate just yet. At least 43 states and Washington, D.C., have allowed gyms to reopen to some extent, according to the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association, a nonprofit trade group. Mr. Cuomo said that he was allowing gyms to reopen now because New York has kept its positive coronavirus test rates at about 1 percent since June. Still, he warned that gyms have been “problematic” in other states. [Is it safe to go back to the gym?] Health clubs in New Mexico and California have been linked to coronavirus cases, and health experts have been worried about the risks of exercising indoors and sharing equipment. Epidemiologists have also warned that the risk of transmission is higher indoors. The city’s museums and cultural institutions can reopen on Monday. Masks are compulsory, and museums must keep the occupancy at 25 percent. Institutions must use a timed ticketing system to regulate the number of visitors. Last week, Mr. Cuomo said bowling alleys could reopen statewide, but with every other lane blocked off to ensure social distancing. Though every part of New York is in the final stage of the state’s reopening plan, several businesses remain closed. Movie theaters, amusement parks and casinos cannot reopen, and indoor malls in New York City remain closed. On Monday, the governor didn’t indicate when those spaces might get the green light. “We’re saying today that gyms for New Yorkers are more essential than movie theaters,” Mr. Cuomo said. 2 Are Arrested in Killing of Jam Master Jay, Hip-Hop Pioneer Can N.Y.C.

[NJ.com] The Times’s Gia Kourlas writes: An aspiring ballerina starts out bright and shiny, a vessel of faith and devotion. But little by little, as disappointments mount and personal tragedies overwhelm, faith and fortitude can crumble. That glow can fade. It’s hard for any dancer. What happens when that dancer is Black? Aesha Ash, who grew up in Rochester, N.Y., attended the esteemed School of American Ballet, the academy of New York City Ballet, and had a leading role in its annual Workshop Performances. Then she took the natural next step: She joined City Ballet, in 1996. Updated August 17, 2020 Back then, the ballet world was less concerned with diversity than it is now. “I wasn’t just dancing for myself, and I wasn’t just dancing to rise through the ranks and be seen by a director to promote me,” Ms. Ash, 42, said. “It was so much bigger than that. I was trying to battle stereotypes and biases on that stage every single night. And I succeeded in some and I failed in others.” Now she finds herself in a position to continue that mission — not only for herself but for generations to come. Starting in September, pandemic or not, she will become the first Black female member of the permanent faculty in the School of American Ballet’s 86-year history. [Read more about Ms. Ash’s career and her thoughts about ballet serving a greater purpose: dismantling stereotypes that exist for women of color.] The school began talking to Ms. Ash about the position in spring 2019, but she didn’t accept until January. The timing of the announcement is something that Ms. Ash said causes her “great fear,” as it might seem like a response to recent events in the Black Lives Matter movement. But she recognizes that it’s the job that matters. “I’m perfectly fine with being that sacrificial lamb,” she said. “I’m willing to be that first because the importance of this moment is so much bigger than any bruising of any ego.” More important, she added, “is who I will be touching once I step foot in that classroom.” It’s Tuesday — stay on point. Dear Diary: When my daughter Elizabeth was 18, I decided to take her to New York for a week to explore and savor the city. Somewhere in Midtown, we came upon a United Airlines counter with a lone uniformed agent. It seemed like a good opportunity to confirm our flight home to California, so we approached the counter. “Don’t whine,” the agent barked at us when we were about 10 feet away. It was such a surprise that I burst out laughing. “What was that about?” I asked. He said he just thought that I looked like a whiner. About two days later, we were somewhere around Second Avenue and Thirteenth Street as my daughter searched for a used pair of Doc Martens. I saw what looked like a classic New York delicatessen. It was lunch time, so we went in and were seated by a waitress who I estimated to be in her 70s. She may have been the owner. After looking over the menu, I decided to order a hot pastrami sandwich. What could be better in a place like this? The waitress took my order, and then paused before turning. “You want it hot,” she said. “But you’ll get it warm, and you’ll like it!” She was right. I did. — Michael Snyder New York Today is published weekdays around 6 a.m. Sign up here to get it by email. You can also find it at nytoday.com. We’re experimenting with the format of New York Today.
