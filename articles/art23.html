By Sopan Deb and Marc Stein RIGHT NOW The Lakers push their lead to 33 late in the third quarter. The Miami Heat are in another must-win game tonight, with the Los Angeles Lakers still just one victory from claiming the franchise’s 17th championship. Behind Jimmy Butler’s second triple-double of the N.B.A. finals, the Heat forced a Game 6 against the Lakers, who were seconds away from victory on Friday. Now the Lakers will turn again to LeBron James, who is seeking his fourth tittle, and Anthony Davis, who is after his first. Click here to refresh for live updates. The Heat have played the Lakers virtually to a draw halfway through the third quarter. Which would be fine, except that Los Angeles entered the second half with a 28-point lead. Miami is  shooting a dismal 34 percent from the floor and has just one more assist (12) than turnovers (11). Jimmy Butler looks tired or, rather, like a mere mortal with 8 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists. By Jonathan Abrams When he was on the verge of reaching the 2020 N.B.A. finals, LeBron James offered praise to some of his Los Angeles Lakers teammates who helped bring the team to championship contention. Rajon Rondo, the backup point guard, capably conducted the team’s offense, James said. Center Dwight Howard provided an interior prowess, he added. “Dwight was a beast,” James said after the Lakers pinned the Denver Nuggets down, three games to one, in the Western Conference finals. “Dwight brought that physical presence. It was great for our ball club.” James, facing the Miami Heat in his 10th N.B.A. finals, is on the cusp of capturing a fourth championship. A knock against him, if there is one to make in his transcendent career, is that he has not won more championships, despite being in a position to do so in almost every year of the 2010s. He doesn’t have to look further than inside his own locker room to spot the roadblocks who stifled his earlier championship efforts with the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Miami Heat. Howard and Rondo played vital roles in prematurely ending his postseasons in the Eastern Conference. They join the other current Lakers Danny Green, JaVale McGee and Quinn Cook as those who firmly and successfully opposed James in years past.

No surprise, then, that the Lakers, fueled by James and a rejuvenated defense, have hiked their lead to a robust 64-36 heading into halftime. James has 11 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists . An uber-aggressive Rajon Rondo, turning back the clock with a recharged first step, has supplied an unexpected 13 points, including several pretty drives and a 3-pointer while shooting 6-for-6. Anthony Davis leads the Lakers with 15 points. The Heat have already played nine players, after gutting out Game 5 with just seven, but they look weary. Miami is shooting just 34.2 percent from the floor against the Lakers’ swarming defense, benefiting little from the six minutes Goran Dragic logged in the first half in his first action since sustaining a torn plantar fascia in his left foot in Game 1. The Lakers’ lead reached 30 points, at 64-34, on consecutive 3-pointers by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (who also has 15 points). Rajon Rondo’s stay in the N.B.A. bubble began in uncomfortable fashion. First Rondo authored a viral social media post that likened the players’ hotel accommodation to a Motel 6. Not long after that, Rondo broke his right thumb in a Lakers practice that sidelined him until the second round of the playoffs. But those are distant memories for Rondo in Game 6 of the N.B.A. finals. He’s off to a 4-for-4 start from the field for a quick 9 points to emerge as the Lakers’ third scorer du jour behind LeBron James and Anthony Davis. The Lakers started out slowly, but Miami’s turnovers allowed the Lakers to build some momentum, as Los Angeles took a 28-20 lead into the second quarter. LeBron James scored 9 points and grabbed 5 rebounds. Anthony Davis had 8 points and added 3 rebounds, but he also picked up two fouls, which may cause issues as the game progresses. With 1:09 left in the first, Goran Dragic entered the game for his first action of the finals since Game 1.  Miami, which has never led, was 4 of 8 from 3-point land to keep them within striking distance of Los Angeles. The Lakers did most of their damage in the paint, often with James and Davis bulldozing to the rim. Jimmy Butler is in survey mode early for Miami. He has taken only one shot from the floor in the game’s first eight-plus minutes, but the Heat are hanging in just fine, trailing only by a point (17-16). The Lakers’ LeBron James, by contrast, has a quick 6 points, 4 rebounds and 2 assists early. Miami’s Duncan Robinson got hot from 3-point range in Game 5. Tonight he has opened with two 3s so far in the first quarter. The shots came amid a sloppy start for both teams. The Heat started 3 of 9 from the field and the Lakers began 4 of 10. Anthony Davis already has two turnovers while the Heat have three of their own. With 6:18 left in the first, the Lakers lead, 13-8. Read more about Robinson’s hot shooting in Game 5: Goran Dragic, the Heat guard, has missed the past four games after tearing a ligament in his left foot during Game 1. It’s unclear how much playing time he’ll get, if any, but at the very least, his presence should be a morale boost for Miami. Entering Game 6, the Lakers are making an adjustment right from the start: Alex Caruso will make his first playoff start in place of Dwight Howard. Howard has struggled on the defensive end for the finals and having Caruso take his place will allow the Lakers to play small from the outset. Danny Green, the Los Angeles Lakers guard, told reporters on Sunday that he and his fiancée had received death threats following Game 5. “I’ve gotten so many messages,” Green said. “I can’t even hit the delete all button. I just don’t read them. I know she probably doesn’t get as many, and she doesn’t have as many followers so she probably can see more of it. I had to ask. I said, ‘Are you getting death threats?’ She’s like, ‘Yeah, you are too.’” He continued, “I don’t know, because I don’t really pay attention or care, nor am I shaken or worried about it.” At the end of Friday’s game, Green missed a wide-open jumper that could have won the game for the Lakers and sent the team to their 17th championship. Green finished the contest with 8 points on 3-of-8 shooting. Several of his teammates had far worse games, but Green was targeted in particular for scorn, especially on social media. One of the most high-profile Lakers fans angry at Danny Green was Snoop Dogg, who on his Instagram story, posted several expletives directed toward Green. “I’d give anything to get that shot back again, trust me,” Green said Sunday. “You’re going to make some. You’re going to miss some. It’s part of the game.” Of the vitriol, Green said: “Fans are emotional. I hope they don’t take it that seriously. I hope that they are that passionate about voting or injustice.” By Scott Cacciola LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Duncan Robinson was struggling with his 3-point shot in the N.B.A. finals, and that was a problem because shooting 3-pointers is the one thing he does exceptionally well. Jimmy Butler, his teammate on the Miami Heat, invited him to his hotel room for a late-night chat. It was a pep talk with a heavy dose of tough love. “He’s hard on me, but it’s because he expects a lot,” Robinson said. “I welcome that. I love that. This whole team wants me to be aggressive and do my job.” Butler has done pretty much everything in this finals series — including motivational speaking — and he delivered again in the Heat’s 111-108 win over the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 5 on Friday night, collecting 35 points, 12 rebounds 11 assists and 5 steals. The Lakers lead the series, three games to two, ahead of Game 6 on Sunday night. And Robinson did his job, too, even though the Lakers had arrived ready to celebrate. Read more: It’s not the crown he’s after, of course, but LeBron James has moved to No. 1 on the N.B.A.’s career list for most playoff games no matter how Sunday night plays out. This Game 6 is the 260th playoff game of LeBron’s career, taking him one beyond the longtime former Lakers guard Derek Fisher. The Lakers need one more win for the fourth championship in James’s 10 career trips to the N.B.A. finals. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
