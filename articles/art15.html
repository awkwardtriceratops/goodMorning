Now it’s facing an even deeper existential crisis. By Julie Bosman KENOSHA, Wis. — Anguished residents wondered if their city would ever recover. The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson came to town and called for justice. An outraged Wisconsin governor vowed to make things right. It was 1988, and a grievous blow had struck Kenosha: Chrysler was shuttering its car assembly plant in the heart of the city, making 5,500 good jobs disappear. Ten percent of the city’s work force was gone, and an industry that had powered the town into middle-class prosperity for decades went quiet. “Everybody thought Kenosha was going to die,” said Jerry Costabile, 58, a charter fishing captain, whose house faces an empty lot where the old car plant once stood. “There was going to be nothing left.” That was the second-worst week in Kenosha history, Mr. Costabile said. This past week, he said, was the worst. Kenosha is now facing an even deeper existential crisis, set in motion last Sunday when a white police officer shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, seven times. Since then, demonstrators have marched through city streets and clashed with the police. After dark, rioters have smashed street lamps, broken windows and burned small businesses in residential neighborhoods. Two people were killed by gunfire on Tuesday night as protesters skirmished with counterprotesters, and a 17-year-old from Illinois armed with a military-style rifle has been charged with homicide. As in 1988, Kenosha is now drawing the sudden sympathies of visitors. Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, and Mr. Jackson, both arrived in town on Thursday. “It’s about wrong and right,” Mr. Jackson said, calling for the firing of the officer who shot Mr. Blake. I was a child in Kenosha when the car plant closed. But I remember the aching fear that it sent rippling through town and into my tiny elementary school, where classmates spoke anxiously of relatives who were Chrysler workers. Everybody, it seemed, had a father or a cousin or a neighbor who was abruptly losing a job, their futures and livelihoods uncertain. This week, I have seen my hometown become a wounded place once again. Mr. Blake’s shooting has registered near-universal horror by residents, who say they do not understand what prompted a police officer to shoot a man seven times during a dispute. They are also incensed and terrified by the destruction that has followed.
