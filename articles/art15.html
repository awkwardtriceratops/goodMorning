That, said the former first daughter, first granddaughter and current co-host of the “Today” show, “might be one step too far.” Hager started the book club in March 2019, and its selections, which are featured on “Today,” tend to get purchased faster than Al Roker can say, “Here’s what’s happening in your neck of the woods.” Fourteen of her 19 picks have become New York Times best sellers. She has anointed debut novelists, including Abi Daré, author of “The Girl With the Louding Voice,” and Megha Majumdar, author of “A Burning,” as well as veterans such as Ann Patchett, Kevin Wilson, Jean Kwok and J. Courtney Sullivan.
