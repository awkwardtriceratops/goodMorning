Mayor<br></h1><p id="artcont">Kathryn Garcia, the sanitation chief, is the third woman to emerge as a candidate to succeed Bill de Blasio. Men were the main contenders until this spring. By Dana Rubinstein Kathryn Garcia, one of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s most trusted cabinet members, resigned on Tuesday from her post as sanitation commissioner in anticipation of a potential run for mayor of New York City. If Ms. Garcia formally enters the race to succeed Mr. de Blasio in 2021, she will be the third administration veteran — all of them women — to run for the job or consider doing so. Mr. de Blasio’s former top counsel, Maya Wiley, resigned from her position at MSNBC to prepare a mayoral run. Loree K. Sutton, who ran New York City’s Department of Veterans’ Services under Mr. de Blasio, announced her candidacy last year. Before coronavirus descended on New York City, the field was thought to have been dominated by three men: Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller; Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president; and Corey Johnson, the speaker of the New York City Council. Ms. Garcia's resignation came just hours before Mr. Stringer made his long-gestating mayoral campaign official, formally announcing his run at a news conference in Upper Manhattan, near his childhood home — suggesting that the 2021 mayoral race has begun in earnest. But the effects of Covid-19 — economic devastation, widespread unemployment and the pandemic-related deaths of nearly 24,000 New Yorkers — have opened the field to  newcomers. Ms. Garcia, 50, has never run for political office before, but she has earned a reputation in City Hall as the mayor’s go-to problem solver. When the head of the New York City Housing Authority left office, Ms. Garcia was named to temporarily manage that agency. After the coronavirus sparked widespread food insecurity, Mr. de Blasio tapped Ms. Garcia to set up an emergency initiative to distribute millions of free meals. But to most voters, Ms. Garcia is a relative unknown. She has yet to flesh out policy prescriptions for New York City; her fund-raising abilities are untested, and the Democratic primary, which is likely to determine the election’s outcome, is only nine months away. Nor is it clear that an association with the de Blasio administration will boost a candidate’s chances. During his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Stringer argued that the mayor failed to deliver on his campaign promise to address the “Tale of Two Cities.” “He made it worse, not better,” Mr. Stringer said.
