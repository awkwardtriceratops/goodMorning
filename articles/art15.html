A Readiness Report<br></h1><p id="artcont">NEWS ANALYSIS Short on money and under enormous pressure, many swing states are still trying to shore up a democratic process challenged daily by court cases, new laws and surges in the coronavirus. By Nick Corasaniti and Reid J. Epstein In Georgia, the state’s voting machines have malfunctioned in three consecutive elections this year alone. In Pennsylvania, election officials are staring down possibly the biggest ballot processing backlog in the country, with no means of even touching the ballots until polls open on Election Day. And in North Carolina, thousands of submitted absentee ballots are currently in purgatory, neither rejected nor accepted but “under review,” amid a back-and-forth court battle over so-called ballot curing. Short on money, overworked and under enormous pressure, many battleground states are still in the process of standing up their electoral systems, a building-a-plane-midflight reality for a democratic process that is being challenged daily by court cases, new laws and surges in the coronavirus. The New York Times assessed the readiness of seven battleground states, and will continue to do so up to Nov. 3. Each of these states was won by Donald J. Trump in 2016; Joseph R. Biden Jr. is now ahead or effectively tied with Mr. Trump in most polls in all seven. After spring and summer primary elections that were undermined by a host of issues — ballot delays in the mail, polling location consolidation resulting in long lines, voter confusion and lengthy lags in counting — officials have mounted a fall sprint to recruit poll workers, scout safe poll locations, seek more time to process ballots, and start a significant education campaign to help voters navigate the pandemic-muddled process. Now, the readiness of states chiefly involves two distinct challenges: processing the tens of millions of absentee ballots that are already flooding election offices, and maintaining an Election Day operation that as closely as possible resembles normalcy. Here’s where the seven states stand with just 15 days before Election Day, ranked in order of preparedness.
