By Bryan Pietsch Thomas Jefferson Byrd, a Tony-nominated actor also known for roles in various Spike Lee films, was found shot to death on an Atlanta street, the authorities said Sunday. Mr. Byrd, 70, was found “unresponsive” by Atlanta police officers, who responded to a call about an injured person at 1:45 a.m. Saturday, Anthony Grant, a spokesman for the police, said. Mr. Byrd was pronounced dead of “multiple gunshot wounds to the back,” Mr. Grant said. Craig Wyckoff, Mr. Byrd’s friend and former representative, said on Sunday that he had spoken with a “circle of friends” who said that Mr. Byrd had gotten into an argument with someone at a store and that “that person must have followed him home.” The police said the case was under investigation and declined to confirm that account. In a series of posts to Instagram, Mr. Lee said he was “So Sad to Announce The Tragic Murder Of Our Beloved Brother” and highlighted Mr. Byrd’s roles in films like “Clockers” (1995), “Chi-Raq” (2015) and “Bamboozled” (2000). “Rest In Peace Brother Byrd,” Mr. Lee wrote. Mr. Byrd also appeared in the 1996 film “Set It Off” and was nominated for a 2003 Tony Award for his role in a Broadway revival of “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” by August Wilson. (A television adaptation is coming to Netflix, starring Viola Davis and Chadwick Boseman, who died in August.) “Loved working with you Byrd,” Ms. Davis wrote in a tweet on Sunday. “What a fine actor you were. So sorry your life ended this way.” A review of “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” in Variety in 2003 hailed Mr. Byrd as “a singular pleasure in the role of Toledo, the verbally fastidious piano player who dispenses nuggets of African history and homegrown philosophy.”
