The police later arrested four suspects and retrieved some stolen cash. By Livia Albeck-Ripka and Elian Peltier Armed men rampaged across a Brazilian coastal city early Tuesday, robbing banks, taking hostages and shooting at least two people, according to the mayor and the police. The siege began just before midnight on Monday in the southeastern city of Criciúma and lasted about an hour. Clésio Salvaro, the mayor, said in a Twitter post just before 2 a.m. local time that the city was under attack, and he ordered residents to remain at home. The two people shot, one of them a police officer, were wounded but survived, the authorities said. “Criciúma is the target of a major assault,” the mayor wrote. “Stay at home.” Mr. Salvaro told Radio Gaúcha, a local station, that the “bandits” had looted three or four sites. “I have no idea where they are from, but they are specialized,” he said. “We have never experienced this in the history of the city.” Brazil has one of the highest crime and homicide rates in the world and bank robberies are hardly uncommon. In recent years, gangs have attempted to dig their way to millions through tunnels, detonated dynamite to rob banks and blown up cash machines. Mr. Salvaro said that the bandits had fled in a convoy of cars and that the police had followed them. Early Tuesday morning, officers arrested four people suspected of involvement in the rampage. The mayor did not say how much money had been stolen, but local news reports said that the police had recovered some of it. Cristian Dimitri Andrade, a Military Police commander in Criciúma, told reporters that the attackers were “several men with rifles, long weapons” and described them as “an organized crime gang which specializes in bank robbery.” “We are receiving information from residents who send us photos and videos,” he told Engeplus, a local news outlet. He said that the attackers had also set fire to a tunnel in the nearby city of Tubarão to try to block additional security forces from arriving. Mr. Salvaro, the mayor, said the robbers had taken six city employees hostage as they were painting street signs. He said they had forced the hostages into a crosswalk to block a street but had later freed them. “I talked to them. They are well,” Mr. Salvaro said in an interview with GloboNews, a major outlet in Brazil. “The information we have is that everyone was released.” The assault left residents in the city of about 220,000 shocked by the violence unfolding in plain sight on the streets, with many filming the chaotic scenes from balconies and windows. Bruno Adriano Della, a 20-year-old citizen, said he had been woken up by gunfire. “The whole city was in shock, and with gunshots everywhere. Nobody knew what to do,” he said. “We were just praying that it would end.” He said the assault reminded him of scenes from the television show “Money Heist,” the Spanish crime drama that follows robbers carrying out elaborate heists. Video footage online showed people grabbing what appeared to be cash off the streets in the aftermath of the attack. “It was pretty terrifying,” said Gustavo Inacio, 21, adding that the assault had been concentrated in the central parts of the city. “I couldn’t sleep out of fear that they would come to the other neighborhoods.” The Military Police of Santa Catarina — a state agency with numerous battalions — intervened in the city and were calling in reinforcements to confront the group, according to local reports. Criciúma is in the state of Santa Catarina and is considered the center of Brazil’s ceramic and floor tile industry.
