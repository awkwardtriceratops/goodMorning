By Matthew Rosenberg Facing questions about its use of the slogan “We Are the Storm,” a rallying cry for QAnon adherents, the Texas Republican Party is defending its adoption of the language, saying it was drawn from a poem and had nothing to do with the internet-driven conspiracy theory that claims President Trump was elected to save America from pedophile Satanists. The state party was responding to a report in The New York Times on Thursday about how a small but growing number of Republicans nationwide have signaled support for QAnon, a movement that the F.B.I. has warned could inspire domestic terrorism. The Texas Republican Party’s use of the slogan was cited by some prominent Republicans there as an example of how some in the G.O.P.’s leadership are opening the party to QAnon followers by adopting language used by the movement.. In a statement posted on its website Friday after the article’s publication, the state party said that the slogan came from a favorite poem of the party’s new chairman, Allen West, and that the line had biblical roots. It is “one of Chairman West’s favorite quotes to use in speeches,” the party said. “He and the entire Texas G.O.P. will not be bullied by partisan leftists in the media into ceding powerful phrases with biblical roots — taken from Psalm 29 — to internet conspiracy groups.” Psalm 29 includes a line about thunder but not the word “storm.” The poem includes the line “I Am the Storm.” Its origins are unclear; it appeared on an Instagram post in 2018 by Tom Brady, then the New England Patriots quarterback, and can be found on a website about scripture and culture. Neither party officials nor Mr. West responded to a question on Saturday about whether they believed that the use of the slogan could be taken by QAnon supporters as a signal of support from Texas Republicans. Instead, Mr. West said that questioning how the party came to use the slogan was “a pure example of the leftist embrace of racism.” “It’s offensive and condescending that white, liberal, progressive socialists would expect me to respond to their demand to know how long I have said something,” he said in a written statement released on Saturday in response The Times. “It is obvious that as a strong, conservative Black man, I am not allowed to think or speak.” Regarding QAnon, Mr. West was quoted by KXAN, the local NBC News affiliate in Austin, as saying this month, “I don’t know about anybody else, and I’m not into internet conspiracy theories.” Messages from the Trump campaign and its surrogates have at times dovetailed with the language and images favored by QAnon followers, and have been used similarly by the White House and state and local party officials around the country. At least a dozen Republican congressional candidates, including one heavily favored to win in Georgia, have espoused some degree of support for the conspiracy theory’s false claim that a “deep-state” cabal of pedophile Satanists led by powerful Democrats is working to take down Mr. Trump.
