By Michael Levenson Ron Paul, the iconoclastic former Republican congressman from Texas who ran for president three times, attracting an enthusiastic following among libertarians, was hospitalized on Friday after he appeared to experience a medical episode and slurred his words while appearing on a livestream video. Video posted on Twitter showed Mr. Paul talking about economics on his YouTube channel before his speech became unintelligible. The video was not available on his YouTube channel on Friday afternoon. Shortly after, a photo shared on Mr. Paul’s Twitter account showed him smiling and giving the thumbs up from a hospital bed. “Message from Ron Paul: ‘I am doing fine. Thank you for your concern,’” the tweet said. It was not immediately clear if Mr. Paul had experienced a stroke. Representatives for Mr. Paul and his son Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, did not immediately respond to messages seeking information about his condition on Friday. “Thank God, Dad is doing well,” Senator Paul said on Twitter. “Thank you for all your prayers today.” Many other admirers of Mr. Paul expressed concern and wishes for his well-being on social media. “Prayers for @RonPaul,” Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, a libertarian and former Republican, wrote on Twitter. “May God watch over him and his family.”
