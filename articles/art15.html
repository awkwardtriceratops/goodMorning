But They’re Stuck in the Seventies.<br></h1><p id="artcont">(And, unfortunately, yes, they mostly are men). By Claudia Sahm Contributing Opinion Writer Let’s face reality: It is likely that no further economic relief is coming from Congress before the election. For months, negotiations between Democrats and Republicans over a follow-up package have alternated between stopping, starting and stalling. Congress and the White House became mired in partisan politics as soon as a tenuous recovery from the worst of the pandemic began. Congress started strong this March, passing the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The measures taken, though imperfect, worked. But we are now the victims of that success, as Congress has lost the will to do more. The outcome is as predictable as it is tragic: as soon as the crisis stabilized enough for partisan inaction to not be political suicide, legislative paralysis returned. In the meantime, coronavirus deaths continue to mount and normalcy remains elusive. It was far too soon to end relief but Congress did it anyway. Temporary job losses have become permanent. Through no fault of their own, businesses have closed their doors forever. Communities have laid off even more teachers. That leaves the Federal Reserve — gatekeeper of the world’s reserve currency, America’s central bank and lender of last resort — as the only game left in town. And its game is not good enough. As with Congress, the Fed acted boldly in March. Financial markets were seizing up and stock prices plunged. The Fed stepped in and pumped trillions of dollars into credit markets to put them back in sync. They offered to lend vast sums to financial institutions and corporations temporarily short on cash. However, shortly after, the Fed fell prey to politics and, perhaps most crucially, to its own longstanding technocratic obsessions and misconceptions. The first signs of the Fed walking away from this crisis began with its two failed lending facilities: one meant for middle-sized businesses and the other meant for municipalities with gaping budget shortfalls. As I wrote in April, these new programs were a watershed; the Fed was poised to support Main Street, for once, not only Wall Street. Even so, these two innovative facilities, authorized in the CARES Act, were rolled out too slowly and months later have made only a handful of loans, largely because the terms of the loans are needlessly onerous. Why is politics to blame? Both Democrats and Republicans took aim at the facilities. Democrats chastised the Fed for making midsize oil companies eligible, and Republicans scoffed at the idea of a “blue state bailout.” In turn, the Fed decided to essentially do nothing. They shifted responsibility to the Treasury and claimed victory with the lending facilities; a victory few strapped businesses or municipalities can see. With financial markets stabilized and stocks rising again, the Fed, in essence, appears to see its job as done. That mistaken view of a mission accomplished doesn’t stem from any malice among the Federal Reserve’s staff or leadership. Rather it comes from expertise that remains out of touch and stubborn fears of inflation that were bred during the crises of the late 1970s and early 1980s. A little over 40 years ago, it took the Fed raising interest rates into the double digits to fight the double-digit inflation that was stifling the economy. No one wants that level of inflation again. But no serious person thinks the economy is in danger of such a precipitous rise in prices. Still, the current leaders of the Federal Reserve, who came of age as students of that inflation crisis, remain chastened by it and continue to overcorrect for it. Even after the central bank was given a “dual mandate” by Congress to fight for more job creation, and not just stabilize prices, it has fought to keep prices stable at the expense of promoting maximum employment. “The Making of Hawks and Doves: Inflation Experiences on the Federal Open Market Committee,” a research study by Ulrike Malmendier, Stefan Nagel and Zhen Yan, tracks how the lived experiences of Fed officials with inflation decades ago has sustained a hawkish culture in American monetary policy in which inflation prevention has always overshadowed employment. In fact, the word “maximum employment” did not appear in an official Fed statement until September 2010. Four months later, the Fed adopted an explicit inflation target of 2 percent. Yet, to this day, it refuses to define full employment.
