It is separate from the newsroom. In a rare bit of bipartisanship, Democratic and Republican lawmakers now agree that Big Tech has gotten too big, too powerful, too quickly. Consider just the past several months: While the coronavirus has felled countless businesses and put millions of Americans out of work, technology stocks have soared and buoyed an otherwise stagnant stock market, further enriching Silicon Valley executives. Record Amazon profits stand in contrast to the bankruptcies of well-known retailers like J.C. Penney and J. Crew. Netflix added millions of new customers this year, as movie theaters struggle to stay afloat. And Facebook and Google are drawing new advertising dollars as homebound users log more on-screen hours. The list continues. Big Tech will loom large in the next four years, even if it has been a sideshow so far on the campaign trail. The pandemic has laid bare both the promise of technology — softening the blow of months at home — and its rougher edges, which include the consolidation of power and ever-greater personal data collection. Whoever claims victory following next week’s election will have to confront, among other things, the exposed gaps in the nation’s broadband network; the urgent need for broad online privacy protections; the rollout of 5G; growing consumer resentment of technologists; and the pitfalls of nascent technologies like self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and facial recognition. “The next administration cannot take a hands-off position in addressing technology’s place in our day-to-day lives,” said Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank. Here are some of the most pressing issues facing a Biden or Trump administration:

Broadband Access
The indefinite closure of many of the nation’s largest school districts amid the pandemic has put a spotlight on the slapdash state of broadband access. In many rural communities and urban centers, reliable access to the web is either impossible or too expensive. Forcing students to log in to classrooms from McDonald’s parking lots is a national embarrassment. With government services and medical care shifting online, those without access to high-speed networks are destined to slip further behind. The next administration must strive to extend affordable internet access to every corner of the nation. “Having access to broadband is an economic necessity,” said Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia. “We could have done more to think creatively about how to expand access during the pandemic,” including through wiring more schools and churches, he said. Flawed federal mapping techniques and a lack of economic incentives for private industry have left as many as 42 million Americans without access to high-speed broadband service, according to one estimate. It’s imperative that the next Congress and president open up funding for a long-term fix. 5G
High-speed wireless 5G networks can help accelerate new uses of mobile technology, like connected vehicles, smart cities and supply chain logistics; ensure speedier and more reliable consumer devices; and set the stage for next-generation tech like smart glasses and in-home robotics. While it is critical that the United States invest in the technology, the nation is already falling behind China, which has devoted billions to subsidizing infrastructure projects.
