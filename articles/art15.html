By Caryn Ganz Five months after the surprise arrival of “Folklore,” an album entirely written and recorded in quarantine, Taylor Swift is doing it again: “Evermore,” the singer and songwriter’s ninth studio album will arrive on Friday. “To put it plainly, we just couldn’t stop writing songs,” Swift wrote in a post on Instagram Thursday morning. “I’ve never done this before,” she added, saying that she’d treated each previous album as a discrete aesthetic cycle and moved on to the next. “I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales,” she wrote. “I loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found into your lives. So I just kept writing them.” “Evermore” features the same core creative team as “Folklore”: Aaron Dessner of the indie-rock band the National and the producer Jack Antonoff (one of her longtime collaborators), along with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver and William Bowery (a.k.a. her boyfriend, the actor Joe Alwyn, who has writing credits on the “Folklore” songs “Exile” and “Betty”). New guests include Haim and the National. “Folklore” has been a chart blockbuster, holding No. 1 on the Billboard 200 for eight nonconsecutive weeks and becoming the first album to sell 1 million copies in 2020. Last month, it received five of Swift’s total Grammy nominations for the 2021 ceremony, including best album; its first single “Cardigan” is up for best song. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
