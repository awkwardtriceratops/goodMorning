By Elizabeth Bruenig Ms. Bruenig is an Opinion writer. Since accusations of sexual misconduct with boys and young men culminated in the former archbishop Theodore McCarrick’s dramatic resignation as a cardinal in 2018 and expulsion from the priesthood the following year, the Catholic hierarchy has been haunted by the question of who knew what, and when. A Vatican-commissioned report released Tuesday gives us a clearer answer: everyone — to the highest echelons of the church — and far sooner than had previously been verified. According to the report, a year before Pope John Paul II installed Mr. McCarrick as archbishop of Washington, D.C., Cardinal John O’Connor of New York warned the pontiff of serious concerns about Mr. McCarrick’s rumored sexual abuses, citing seminarians who had entered psychiatric treatment in the wake of their encounters with him. The warning, in a letter dated Oct. 28, 1999, persuaded the pope to delay the installation. The reputation of the church might have been spared a serious blow if he had then deployed a sincere investigation of the enterprising bishop. But when Cardinal O’Connor died in the spring of 2000, Mr. McCarrick caught wind of the letter and wrote to the pope’s personal secretary, swearing that the accusations were malicious lies and that he had never had sex with any man, woman or child.
