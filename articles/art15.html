He’ll Have to Start at Home.<br></h1><p id="artcont">America has to be a functioning democracy before it can be an exemplary one. By Michelle Goldberg Opinion Columnist During the end of Barack Obama’s presidency and the beginning of Donald Trump’s, Frances Brown served as the director for democracy on the staff of the National Security Council. It was her job to help coordinate administration efforts to support democracy, encourage free and fair elections, and oppose authoritarianism abroad. Among America’s most important tools in this regard, she told me, are statements from its political leaders and high-level diplomats backing democratic moves in other countries and speaking out against autocratic ones. Obviously, American denunciation was not enough to arrest authoritarianism, but it wasn’t meaningless, either. “The idea of closer relations to the U.S. and Oval Office visits, a photo-op — that still matters to many leaders around the world,” said Brown. Besides, for better or worse, America would sometimes pair its rhetoric with economic pressure or limits on arms sales. “Those kinds of policies often do accompany public condemnation,” she said, though they tend to be “more under the radar.” These days, Brown, who left the government in the summer of 2017, often thinks about the memos she’d have written if she’d seen Trump’s actions in another country: “Leader uses security services to ‘dominate’ peaceful protesters. Leader refuses to pledge a peaceful transition of power if he loses upcoming election. Leader threatens extrajudicial imprisonment of political opponents. Leader threatens members of press. Leader encourages violent nonstate militia that targets minority population.”
