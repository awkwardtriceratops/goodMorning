In a lawsuit, survivors of the catastrophe and descendants of victims said the city and state needed to rectify the past. By Maria Cramer Nearly 100 years after white mobs slaughtered Black residents and destroyed a prosperous Black business district in Tulsa, Okla., survivors of the massacre and descendants of the victims filed a lawsuit against the city and others on Tuesday, saying they must be compensated for the losses they endured. Greenwood was once a booming business district in Tulsa, comprising some 40 blocks of restaurants, hotels and theaters owned and run by Black entrepreneurs. But in 1921, it was destroyed by a white mob enraged after a confrontation with armed Black Tulsans trying to save a man from being lynched. Decades later, Greenwood is now only half a block, according to lawyers for the plaintiffs, who accused Tulsa officials of appropriating the massacre, decrying the horrors of the past while trying to turn what remains of the district into a tourist destination. “It’s so much more than a tourist site — it’s a crime scene,” said the Rev. Dr. Robert Turner of the Historic Vernon African Methodist Episcopal Church in Tulsa, the only structure in Greenwood that was not destroyed by the mobs. “Until Tulsa does right by Greenwood, this district will forever be a crime scene.” The lawsuit, which was filed in Tulsa County District Court, names seven defendants, including the Tulsa County sheriff, the Oklahoma National Guard and the city’s Chamber of Commerce. The sheriff’s office declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for the mayor of Tulsa, G.T. Bynum, did not respond to messages seeking comment on Tuesday. The episode started on May 31, 1921, after a Black man was accused of sexually assaulting a white woman. The man, Dick Rowland, was arrested that morning and jailed in the Tulsa County Courthouse. A large group of armed Black people, fearful Mr. Rowland would be lynched, rushed to the courthouse to ensure his safety. The charges against Mr. Rowland were later dropped, and the authorities eventually concluded that he had most likely tripped and stepped on the woman’s foot, according to a 2001 report from the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921. But by June 1, the day after the arrest, a large mob of white Tulsans had begun setting fire to businesses in Greenwood. People were killed on the street or simply vanished. One of the plaintiffs is Don M. Adams, the nephew of Dr. A.C. Jackson, an accomplished Black surgeon who was shot in the stomach as he tried to surrender to the mob. He bled for five hours before he died, said Damario Solomon-Simmons, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs.
