This year, he says, they were even worse. The difference between the final polls and the actual results was just as wide, but pollsters don’t have the same excuses this time around, he tells us. So, what happened? Nate talks us through a few of his theories — including that some Republicans, particularly Trump supporters, are less likely to pick up the phone and answer a survey — and considers whether, after two flawed performances, polling should be ditched.
