By Vanessa Friedman For the last five years, the name Gucci has been synonymous with success, with a fashion reinvention that has helped redirect the luxury industry toward inclusivity, emotion and the importance of creativity. The family that created the brand has a more complicated, darker past, one involving tax evasion, generational feuds and murder. This week, another charge will be added to that list. On Tuesday, Alexandra Zarini, the 35-year-old granddaughter of Aldo Gucci, the man responsible for transforming an artisanal leather goods house into a global behemoth, filed suit in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles. In it, she describes years of sexual abuse from her former stepfather, Joseph Ruffalo, and complicity and a cover-up on the part of her mother, Patricia Gucci, and grandmother, Bruna Palombo. According to the court documents, Mr. Ruffalo, a music manager who worked with Prince and Earth, Wind & Fire, began abusing Ms. Zarini when she was about six years old and continued until she was about 22. In her lawsuit she describes him regularly climbing naked into bed with her when she was a child and teenager and fondling her breasts and genitals; flashing his genitals at her; and rubbing his penis against her body. The lawsuit also claims that her mother, Patricia Gucci, and her grandmother knew of the abuse for years and that her mother not only helped groom her for Mr. Ruffalo’s advances by allowing him to videotape her naked in the bath but also regularly hit her. In addition, the suit states that both women threatened her so that she would remain quiet. In a statement emailed to The New York Times, Ms. Gucci wrote: “I am deeply sorry for the pain Joseph Ruffalo caused Alexandra. What he did to her is inexcusable and I was devastated when she disclosed everything to me at our family doctor’s office in London in September 2007. I immediately initiated divorce proceedings against Mr. Ruffalo and set about healing my family through counseling. I am equally devastated by the allegations against me and her grandmother, which are completely false.” Mr. Ruffalo’s lawyer, Richard P. Crane Jr., responded: “My client has not been served and has not read the complaint. Therefore, he is not aware of all of the allegations that the Complaint contains. What he has been informed of, he vehemently and categorically denies. While married to Alexandra’s mother, Mr. Ruffalo and his wife were greatly concerned about the mental well-being of Alexandra and took steps to address her instability. Apparently, their efforts failed.” Along with a forthcoming Ridley Scott film starring Lady Gaga about the plot to murder Maurizio Gucci orchestrated by his ex-wife, the sex abuse filing, in which Ms. Zarini has asked for a trial by jury, will once again draw public attention to the underbelly of what can appear a gilded story. The Gucci family has not been associated with the Gucci brand since 1993, when Maurizio Gucci (who is Ms. Zarini’s mother’s cousin) sold his final stake to the Bahrain-based Investcorp, which took it public; Gucci was subsequently acquired by PPR, which became Kering, Gucci’s current owner. But the family is conscious of its relationship to the luxury house and that their legacies are forever intertwined. In 2016, Patricia Gucci published a memoir, “In the Name of Gucci,” about her life and her parents’ relationship, which began in secret and lasted 30 years. Aldo Gucci, her father, was already married and had three sons when he met her mother, a sales clerk in the Rome store; they began an affair at a time when adultery was illegal in Italy. Patricia, however, was doted on by her father. She was featured in a Gucci ad campaign, given a seat on the company board at 19, and named a roving ambassador for the brand. In 1986, while embroiled in a family feud, Aldo Gucci was convicted of tax evasion in the United States and served a year in prison; he died in 1990. Patricia married, had two children, divorced and then started a relationship with Joseph Ruffalo. Ms. Gucci and her two daughters moved to California to live with him; they later married and had a child, though according to Ms. Zarini, he had already begun abusing her. In the lawsuit, Ms. Zarini said that when she had nightmares as a child and climbed into bed with her mother, Mr. Ruffalo would be there, naked, and she would wake up to find her hand on his penis. As Ms. Zarini got older, she said, Mr. Ruffalo’s behavior began to escalate.
