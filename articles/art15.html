By Elizabeth Bruenig Ms. Bruenig is an Opinion writer. Dave O’Bannon, 62, cast his first presidential ballot, in 1976, for a fellow evangelical — Jimmy Carter. “I fell in love with Jimmy Carter,” he sighed on an October phone call. “I just fell in love with his love of God.” At the time, Mr. O’Bannon was 18 years old, and the Republican campaign to capture the white evangelical vote was just gaining momentum. Mr. O’Bannon was shortly swept up by the party’s alliance with conservative Christians, and for the next four decades, he would not cast a single presidential ballot for a Democrat. It seemed like a reasonable bargain for evangelicals, Protestant Christians whose distinctive mix of activism, biblical focus and emphasis on being “born again” makes them unusual. Political objectives could advance evangelicals’ religious convictions — ending abortion, halting the sexual revolution and permitting demonstrations of faith in public settings, like prayer in schools. Theirs was a politics of piety intended to spiritually renew a broadly Christian country that often seemed to lose sight of its moral guideposts. They brought their fervor to a party otherwise concerned with lowering taxes and limiting government reach. The Republican Party would lend their moral aspirations the force of law, and they would be the party’s conscience.
