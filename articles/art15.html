Did the August conventions offer a road map for saving a flailing political institution? By Adam Nagourney and Michael M. Grynbaum After 18 hours of speeches by the candidates, testimonials from former presidents and generals, poignant appeals from voters, a cross-country nominating roll call, opera on a White House balcony and fireworks over the Washington Monument, the verdict is in on the national political conventions.
