How Do I Know It’s Safe to Go Outside?<br></h1><p id="artcont">A high-tech sensor network brought me closer to the natural cycles of my environment. By Annalee Newitz Contributing Opinion Writer Here in California, those of us lucky enough to escape the wildfires are battling smoke. We can’t always see our enemy, but we can smell it. For a while, the whole Bay Area reeked of rotting plants; experts suggested that a source was succulents burning along the Santa Cruz coastline. Some nights, there’s a rich, woodsy scent that reminds me of sitting on the beach around a campfire. But in the morning, the odor is more like stale cigarette butts. As I write this, the stench is of burning rubber and plastic. At first, it’s an annoyance. But then the sinus headaches kick in, or the asthma, and the anxious lethargy that comes with staying indoors on a hot day with the windows shut tight. When will we be able to breathe again? To find out, many of us in the Bay Area have turned to a community-driven app called PurpleAir. Using OpenStreetMap and a worldwide network of 8,000 environmental sensors — mostly mounted on private homes — PurpleAir reveals the air quality in your neighborhood at any given moment. It’s a straightforward and practical tool. The Environmental Protection Agency, university researchers, and popular weather services like Weather Underground all use PurpleAir’s data. But the app is also a harbinger of where “smart city” technology might take us. These days, most of us encounter such devices in the form of surveillance cameras run by law enforcement, or in the agile electrical grids managed by local utilities. Many of these systems raise concerns about who has access to vast amounts of data, often with little oversight.
