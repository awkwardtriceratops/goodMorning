House Seat<br></h1><p id="artcont">Supported by Jeff Van Drew, a Republican congressman who defected from the Democrats, beat back a challenge from a former schoolteacher who is married to a Kennedy nephew. By Patrick McGeehan and Tracey Tully Representative Jeff Van Drew, a onetime Democrat who switched parties in December and declared allegiance to President Trump, held onto his New Jersey seat in a race against Amy Kennedy, a former teacher who married into an American political dynasty. The race was the last New Jersey congressional contest to be decided, and one of only two in the state won by a Republican. Mr. Van Drew’s protracted victory appeared to vindicate his politically fraught decision to cross party lines and align himself with the president during last year’s impeachment proceedings. The Associated Press declared Mr. Van Drew the winner at midday on Friday. Its tally showed that he had received 51.7 percent of the votes, compared with 46.7 percent for Ms. Kennedy. That 5 point lead amounted to more than 15,000 votes as of Friday afternoon. Mr. Van Drew had claimed victory nearly three days earlier, on election night, with tens of thousands of ballots still to be counted. But Ms. Kennedy had not conceded by early Friday afternoon. The Associated Press called the race with about 80 percent of precincts reporting. Mr. Van Drew may be returning to Washington without Mr. Trump, whose prospects for re-election appeared to be fading fast as the last votes were counted in Pennsylvania and other battleground states. A posting on the Facebook page of Mr. Van Drew’s campaign said that he had spoken to Mr. Trump on Thursday night and offered to help the president in any way he could. “Our campaigns have worked hand in hand from day one and have continued to do so since Election Night,” the posting said. In a statement issued after the race was called on Friday, Mr. Van Drew made only a passing reference to his decision to switch parties. “The United States of America is an exceptional nation and I will continue to work with anyone willing to put party aside to fight for a strong America and a strong South Jersey,” Mr. Van Drew said. First elected to the House two years ago as a Democrat, Mr. Van Drew overcame his opponent’s lead in most polls, a considerable fund-raising disadvantage and the familiarity of the Kennedy name. Ms. Kennedy’s husband, Patrick Kennedy, a former congressman from Rhode Island, is a nephew of President John F. Kennedy. Ms. Kennedy’s performance in her home base of Atlantic County was disappointing, compared with the strong support there for Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president, in the presidential race. With about three-fourths of the expected votes in Atlantic County counted, Mr. Biden had a 9,000-vote edge on Mr. Trump. But Ms. Kennedy was leading Mr. Van Drew there by fewer than 4,800 votes. “Jeff Van Drew has been around a long time, and he’s got cross-party support, but I was not expecting a drop-off like that,” said Michael Suleiman, chairman of the Atlantic County Democratic Committee. “I wish Amy had a better showing out of Atlantic County.” Local observers attributed much of that falloff to the work of Craig Callaway, a notorious political operative whom Mr. Van Drew had paid more than $100,000 for his get-out-the-vote efforts. Mr. Callaway, who served more than three years in prison for bribery, specializes in delivering mail ballots from low-income precincts in and around Atlantic City, a Democratic stronghold. State law was changed five years ago to limit to three the number of ballots a “messenger” like Mr. Calloway can deliver to a polling place or collection site. Mr. Callaway had worked for Ms. Kennedy during the Democratic primary, but after a falling out signed on with the Van Drew campaign. “It’s been a controversial operation over time, but it’s never been actually proven vote fraud,” said John Froonjian, director of the William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy at Stockton University, in the state’s Galloway Township. Mr. Callaway did not respond to messages seeking comment. Ms. Kennedy, 42, carried only two of the eight counties — Atlantic and Cumberland — within the Second Congressional District, which stretches across the southern end of New Jersey from the Atlantic Ocean to the Delaware River. Mr. Van Drew overcame those deficits by winning in the more conservative counties of Cape May, Gloucester, Ocean and Salem. The district also includes small portions of Burlington and Camden Counties. Mr. Van Drew was a vocal opponent of the president’s impeachment and joined the Republicans in December when it became clear that he could not count on re-election support from Democratic leaders in his South Jersey district, setting up a marquee House race infused with national angst. “A lot of money and a lot of power was used against me, quite frankly, to remove me from my seat during a difficult year,” Mr. Van Drew said in an address to supporters late Tuesday, which his campaign manager, Ron Filan, said was a declaration of victory. “But the truth is, we believed,” he added. “We believed in the America that we know, the America that we love, the America that we know is this great place.” Mr. Van Drew was able to overcome the stigma of switching parties, buoyed by Mr. Trump’s warm embrace in a district that the president won by about five points in 2016. Comparable results for Mr. Trump in the district this year were not available. In another close congressional contest in South Jersey, Representative Andy Kim, a first-term Democrat, defeated David Richter, a wealthy Republican businessman who similarly yoked himself to Mr. Trump during the campaign. And Representative Tom Malinowski, a first-term Democrat who, like Mr. Kim, was elected two years ago in a so-called blue wave aligned against Mr. Trump, defeated Thomas Kean Jr., the minority leader of the State Senate.
