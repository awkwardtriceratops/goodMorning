By Jeanna Smialek WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, said on Thursday that the labor market’s recovery was only halfway complete and that more government support would likely be needed to return the economy to full strength, calling the recent rise in virus cases “particularly concerning.” In remarks after the central bank’s November meeting, Mr. Powell reiterated that the economic outlook is “extraordinarily uncertain” and pledged to continue supporting growth for as long as needed. Economic progress has exceeded initial expectations amid state and local reopenings, but the recovery remains incomplete, progress is moderating and risks loom ahead. Mr. Powell noted that the U.S. is “a long way from our goals, and we’re halfway there on the labor market recovery, at best.” The Fed is trying to coax the economy back to full health. It left interest rates unchanged at its November meeting, having slashed them to near-zero in March, and it reiterated that it plans to keep them low for the foreseeable future. The central bank has also been buying huge quantities of government-backed bonds — about $120 billion a month, recently — in an attempt to keep markets functioning smoothly and to stimulate demand. It said it would keep the purchases up at that pace “at least.” Low rates do seem to be powering a recovery. Housing has been a bright spot, for instance, as buyers scramble to purchase new and existing houses. But government spending programs have also been an important driver of the rebound so far, keeping money flowing to businesses and households. Now further economic progress is teetering on a precipice as U.S. coronavirus cases rise and those government support programs run dry. The outcome of this week’s presidential and congressional election remains uncertain, making it hard to guess whether and when the government will renew programs that created forgivable small business loans, expanded unemployment insurance and provided other safeguards that have helped to keep businesses and families afloat. Mr. Powell said the two biggest economic risks right now are the “further spread of the disease” and the likelihood that households will run through the savings they were able to accumulate as a result of government programs early in the pandemic, including stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits. “The fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference,” Mr. Powell said. “Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes.”
