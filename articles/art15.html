By David Leonhardt Want to get The Morning by email? Here’s the sign-up. The United States is no longer the world’s only rich country still suffering through a major coronavirus outbreak. So is Spain. Spain’s number of cases has surged in the last month. Over the last week, its per capita rate of new cases has been five times larger than France’s, six times larger than Portugal’s and 15 times larger than Japan’s. Adjusted for population, Spain’s outbreak has even surpassed the U.S. outbreak over the last few days. How has it happened? Health experts are still trying to figure that out. But some of the early answers may sound familiar to Americans. Lack of a clear national message. Spain’s prime minister — Pedro Sánchez, of the Socialist Workers’ Party — has not promoted medical disinformation, as President Trump has. Yet Sánchez has recently handed back control of virus policy to regional governments, instead of continuing to provide clear leadership about how people should behave. “In the past month, regions have announced new measures almost weekly, and they have often differed,” Raphael Minder, who’s based in Madrid for The Times, told me. Last week, Sánchez went on vacation and didn’t address the public as the crisis mounted, Rodrigo Orihuela of Bloomberg reported. Premature reopening. Spanish officials, like their American counterparts, made the mistake of thinking they could help the economy by prioritizing it over public health. Bars and nightclubs reopened. British tourists — a major source of revenue — were allowed to travel to Spain without restriction, in what María Ramírez of El Diario called “a desperate attempt to save the summer season.” In truth, the only way to help the economy is to control the virus. “We wanted to return to normality too quickly,” Magda Campins, a Barcelona doctor, told El País. Not enough testing and contact tracing. The shortages have made it “difficult for health authorities to identify and isolate potential virus carriers,” according to The Wall Street Journal. As I’ve written before, there is a set of consistent lessons from around the world about how to beat back the virus: Mass testing. Rapid quarantines, contact tracing and, when necessary, lockdowns. Limited social gatherings, especially indoors. Widespread mask wearing. After taking these steps, many countries, including Canada, Australia and much of Europe and Asia, have the virus under control. Spain itself followed this strategy in the spring and also sharply reduced new cases (as you can see in the chart above) — before lifting its state of emergency on June 21 and reopening less carefully than its neighbors. Since then, it has joined the U.S. as a classic exception that proves the rule. In other virus developments: Scientists have confirmed the first known case of reinfection in a person who had recovered. But the patient experienced no symptoms from his second infection, indicating his immune system may have learned how to respond. A judge in Florida struck down the state’s requirement that public schools open their classrooms for in-person instruction.
