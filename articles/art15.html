Dear Diary: I went to the Museum of Modern Art and stopped at the gift shop before doing the galleries. I was at a counter checking out some pens when I noticed a woman a few feet away examining a display of artsy earrings. She was wearing a striking jacket of many colors, and I watched as she walked off. Walking over to the jewelry, I admired a pair of tiny earrings that looked like zipper pulls. I spotted a cellphone, and I took it to the cashier and explained where I had found it. As I turned around, I saw the woman in the colorful jacket. I remembered that she had just been at the jewelry counter. I told her I had found a phone. She got a panicked look as she felt through her pockets. When I told her to check with the cashier, she hurried off. In a minute, she turned back toward me with a big grin. “It is mine,” she called across the room. “Thank you, thank you. What can I do for you?” “Nothing,” I said. “‘Thanks’ will do.” “Well thank you,” she said. “But I must do more. Here, do you like these?” She held up a small card holding something blue. It was a pair of tiny earrings that looked like zipper pulls. — Judith Hoy Dear Diary: It was on Putnam Avenue in Brooklyn between Ralph and Patchen, sometime in 1946 or ’47. Word went around the neighborhood one day that you could buy a pet snail for a penny. All you had to do was provide your own can of water, give your penny to the storekeeper and “plop,” the snail was yours. All day long, kids were walking around carrying tin cans with snails climbing up the sides trying to escape. When they got to the top of the can, they would be dunked back down again. When it was time to go home, the snails were all dead. The pet snail craze had started, peaked and evaporated, all before dinner.
