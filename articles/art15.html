Why didn’t the art world notice? By Philip Gefter In the mid-1960s, three of Richard Avedon’s closest friends reached Olympian heights in their respective fields: Truman Capote published “In Cold Blood,” an overnight best seller that would forge a new genre in literature; Mike Nichols received an Academy Award nomination as director of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”; and Leonard Bernstein won a Grammy for his “Third Symphony (Kaddish).” Their achievements cast Avedon’s own career in stark relief. He may have been the most glamorous photographer in the world, but in the context of film, literature and classical music, he was still only a fashion photographer. It irked him, too, that his portrait work was considered “celebrity photography.” The prestige of his name had indeed come from his portraits of Marilyn Monroe, Brigitte Bardot, Elizabeth Taylor, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, but by then he had also established his own visual pantheon of arts and letters with portraits of W.H. Auden, Marianne Moore, Ezra Pound, Isak Dinesen, Marian Anderson and Jasper Johns, among many others. “Don’t think about who they are,” he would later tell people who marveled at the prominence of his subjects. “Just look at their faces.” Avedon was of a generation that endured the threat of the atomic bomb. More and more, he photographed his subjects like specimens under the forensic scrutiny of his lens for the strain of existential dread that runs through our species at the thought of annihilation. Certainly, no one is smiling against the white nuclear backdrop in his portraits. Now, in his early 40s, and notoriously competitive, he measured himself against his friends’ triumphs. “I had this block,” he later recalled about that period. “I could photograph, but I couldn’t do anything that meant anything to me for a number of years.” His breakthrough occurred in the late 1960s as he had been searching for a way to represent that tumultuous era — in effect, a way to “portraitize” a set of cultural values that defined the period. In August 1968, the Democratic National Convention in Chicago attracted thousands of antiwar protesters. The police used tear gas and billy clubs to beat back the crowds in a clash that was televised for the entire world to witness — including the horrified parents of the student-age demonstrators. Eight political activists were arrested on charges of inciting the protests, but after the case against one of them, Bobby Seale, was declared a mistrial, they became known as the Chicago Seven. They would be Avedon’s first subjects in his new artistic endeavor. (A Netflix film about the notorious trial debuts Friday, Oct. 16.) Avedon had just begun to use a new camera — an 8-by-10 inch Deardorff — which enabled him to make direct eye contact with his subjects, as opposed to the smaller twin-lens Rolleiflex he had always used that required him to look down into the viewfinder and away from the subject. “They couldn’t see my eyes, and I couldn’t see them,” he said. Now he could stand next to the camera and make direct eye contact with his subjects. When the Chicago Seven trial began, in September 1969, Avedon took his new Deardorff, along with his studio entourage, to Chicago. He hung a large roll of white seamless paper in one corner of his Chicago Hilton suite and held a fund-raiser for the legal defense, inviting the defendants, their lawyers, and deep-pocket supporters. As the guests mingled, he asked them to step into the frame of his makeshift “proscenium,” trying for as much spontaneity as possible.
