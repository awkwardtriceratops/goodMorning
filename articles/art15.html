Dr. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, was leading Senator Kelly Loeffler after a race in which she was bloodied by a fellow Republican. The race will be decided in a January runoff. By Nicholas Fandos The Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, a Democrat, emerged as the leader Tuesday over Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican, in a special election to fill a Georgia Senate seat that will now be decided in a January runoff. Fueled by his party’s resurgence in the heart of the Deep South, Dr. Warnock will face Ms. Loeffler in a closely watched one-on-one contest on Jan. 5. Ms. Loeffler, a businesswoman and the Senate’s richest member, was temporarily appointed to fill the seat late last year. With a crowded field of Democrats and Republicans on the Nov. 3 ballot, neither reached the 50 percent threshold required under Georgia law to win outright, according to The Associated Press, but after a nasty intraparty struggle, Ms. Loeffler prevailed over Representative Doug Collins. The runoff between Dr. Warnock and Ms. Loeffler promised to be one of the hardest-fought and most expensive contests in the state’s history. Depending on the outcome of other races, it could determine which party controls the Senate just two weeks before Inauguration Day.
