Then Trump Came Along.<br></h1><p id="artcont">For decades, Republicans in Manhattan carved out a niche by embracing socially liberal causes. President Trump’s election destroyed that centrism. By Dana Rubinstein and Azi Paybarah Over the course of two decades, the New York City Republican Party got two mayors elected in deep blue New York City. It was a neat trick made possible by the party’s ability to toe a centrist line — conservative on the budget, liberal on social issues. But that line has shifted in the era of President Trump, and so has the idea of a New York City Republican. The Metropolitan Republican Club in Manhattan, whose members have included Theodore Roosevelt and Nelson A. Rockefeller, has in the last two years hosted talks by Steve Bannon; the Breitbart News editor, Joel Pollak; and the Proud Boys founder, Gavin McInnes. Republicans are now outnumbered by Democrats in Manhattan by nearly eight to one, and some prominent New Yorkers like Joseph Lhota, the 2013 Republican candidate for mayor, have left the party. “It had to do with Donald Trump, as head of the party,” Mr. Lhota said. “I just couldn’t deal with it.” Few things embody the change more than the Manhattan Republican Party, and the divergent paths of the city’s two former Republican mayors from Manhattan: Michael R. Bloomberg, who is now a Democrat, and Rudolph W. Giuliani. In a vitriolic speech in New York in September, Mr. Giuliani said that Mayor Bill de Blasio’s biracial son should fear “another Black” more than a police officer, and that Black Lives Matter protesters are “cop killers” who might also want to kill white people. “When you see a police officer killed, which you are watching, somebody is carrying out what Black Lives Matter asked them to do,” Mr. Giuliani said. “Or if you see a white person killed, it could be that, too.” Mr. Giuliani made his remarks at a forum hosted by the Manhattan Republican Party, which is now run by the family of John Catsimatidis, a billionaire Republican grocery magnate who has run for mayor. He has given the majority of the party’s recent political donations; his daughter, Andrea, 30, is the party chair. Mr. Catsimatidis has evolved from a self-described undecided voter at the 2016 Republican convention to a full-throated Trump supporter in 2020. “If you vote on personality, Trump loses. If you vote on performance, Trump wins,” Mr. Catsimatidis said.
