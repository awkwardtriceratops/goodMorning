By Michael Crowley and Adam Goldman WASHINGTON — Two Americans held hostage by Iran-backed Houthi fighters in Yemen were released on Wednesday in a deal brokered by the Trump administration and the government of Oman, according to a senior administration official. Sandra Loli, an aid worker, had been held in the war-ravaged country for 16 months, and Mikael Gidada, a businessman, who had also been held for a lengthy period of time. They were released as part of an agreement under which about 240 Houthis in Oman, many of them former armed combatants originally captured by Saudi Arabia, were allowed to return to Yemen. Some of them were former armed combatants. Houthi leaders also released the remains of a third American, Bilal Fateen, a Yemeni dual national who died of natural causes while in captivity. “Our family is filled with immense relief and gratitude that Sam — a beloved wife, mother, daughter, sister and friend — has been released and reunited with her family,” said Ms. Loli’s husband, Richard Boni, in a statement. He described Ms. Loli as “stable and in good spirits.” Freeing Americans held abroad has been a top priority for President Trump and his national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, who previously served as Mr. Trump’s chief hostage negotiator. In a brief statement, Mr. O’Brien thanked the sultan of Oman and the king of Saudi Arabia “for their efforts to secure the release of our citizens.”
