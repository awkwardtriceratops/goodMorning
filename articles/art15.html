(We Checked.)<br></h1><p id="artcont">Divided government sometimes overperforms expectations. By James M. Curry and Frances E. Lee Mr. Curry and Ms. Lee are the authors of “The Limits of Party.” Many progressives are in despair at the prospect of Joe Biden facing a Senate with Mitch McConnell as majority leader. On top of that, this might be as good as it gets for Biden: The president’s party almost always loses seats in Congress at the midterm, which may well mean divided government for his entire term. Does that mean that ambitious things — climate change legislation, health care and policing reforms — are off the table, and little of consequence will be achieved? Not necessarily. That’s because divided government sometimes overperforms expectations. Unified governments, on the other hand, usually end in disappointment for the party in power. The hard truth about the U.S. political system is that very little legislation gets enacted without bipartisan support. Even as voting in Congress has polarized generally, there has been no increase in the share of legislation enacted on party-line votes. Laws rarely pass without substantial backing from the minority party. Since 2011, 90 percent of new laws that cleared the House and 75 percent that cleared the Senate received positive votes from at least a majority of minority party members. This kind of broad support is not confined to minor legislation. Fully 90 percent of the laws included on a list of landmark legislation enacted during that time (put together by the political scientist David Mayhew of Yale) received support from most minority party members in one or both chambers. They often receive less attention because they do not involve as much partisan combat, but they are instructive for the way the system works, with compromise on each side. For example, the 21st Century Cures Act (2016) dramatically increased National Institutes of Health funding (a Democratic priority) and streamlined F.D.A. approvals (a Republican priority); the 2018 bipartisan deal ended spending caps established by the Budget Control Act, and Republicans got military spending increases while Democrats got domestic spending increases. We looked at the success of majority parties in achieving their stated policy goals, from 1985 through 2018, by tracking more than 250 proposals. For each, we marked whether Congress enacted a law that achieved most of what the party wanted, some of what it wanted or none of what it wanted as it failed to pass any new policy. The parties failed outright roughly half the time; there was no real difference between Democrats and Republicans and no long-term trends in success or failure over time. When one party had unified control, it made only a modest difference: In a unified government, congressional majority parties failed on 43 percent of their agenda priorities; in divided government, the number was 49 percent.
