An elephant’s pandemic journey. Bike shorts. And more. By Jillian Rayfield Welcome to the weekend. This week, we had major news in the U.S. presidential race: Joe Biden’s selection of Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate. As we get closer to the fall, the election season is intensifying, and it will continue to do so over the next two weeks with the Democratic and Republican conventions. So before all of that starts, try to take a break from the news cycle. Maybe make some homemade ice cream. Or enjoy a bit of moth-watching. But still make time for some incredible journalism. For some on the South Side of Chicago, like Antoine Dobine, above, words are insufficient, and an embrace of the Black Lives Matter movement requires caring for communities that both Democrats and Republicans have ignored. _____ Some national chains, both retail and restaurants, are closing outlets in New York City, where their branches are struggling more than elsewhere. _____ A fear of hospitals is leading many Mexicans to delay treatment for the coronavirus until it is too late for doctors to help them. Above: Fabiola Palma Rodríguez’s husband died an hour after reaching the hospital. _____ Photographs of generations of Black suffragists offer invaluable documents of their thwarted and central roles in the history of women’s rights. Above, the suffragist Nannie Helen Burroughs, center and framed by a black doorway, in 1909. _____ After decades in captivity and a 1,700-mile road trip from Argentina into Brazil, an Asian elephant named Mara finally gained a chance to roam. _____ “Having those months off to work on certain stuff definitely helped,” she said. _____ As the coronavirus spread on the Fort Apache reservation in Arizona, medical teams sought out residents who might have been exposed. The effort paid off in unexpected ways. _____ “Jurassic World: Dominion,” filming in England, is a chance for the movie industry to see if it can move past the financial woes caused by the pandemic. _____ In her new book “Men to Avoid in Art and Life,” Nicole Tersigni harnesses her skill with a Twitter meme to illuminate the experience of women harassed by concern trolls, “sexperts” and more. _____ With international travel still largely curtailed, you can take a pictorial trip around the world via these abstract architectural photographs. Can you identify the city in which each was taken? _____ Are stretchy shorts an enlightened choice for the times, or a tumble into sartorial laziness? Either way, they work. _____ For more great reads, follow me, @jillrayfield, on Twitter. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
