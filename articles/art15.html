Also: Fires and wind cause dangerous conditions in Northern California. By Jill Cowan Good morning. Early voting, including voting by mail, in this election has decimated records in states across the country, including California, where more than 6.5 million ballots have already been returned, according to the state. Still, over the weekend, California voters lined up to cast their ballots early at dozens of newly open polling places, including, for the first time, Staples Center, home of the Los Angeles Lakers. Hundreds more will open on Oct. 30. On Thursday, I talked with California’s secretary of state, Alex Padilla, about what voters should know in the homestretch, especially if they’re planning to vote in person. Here’s our conversation, lightly edited for clarity: How are things going? What’s the biggest challenge on your mind right now? Californians are voting in big numbers. We’re about 2.5 times where we were at this point in 2016, if that’s any indicator. We’ve been planning and preparing for months. And if voter registration and early returns are any indication, it’s going to be a big turnout.
