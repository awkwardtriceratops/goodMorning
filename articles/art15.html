By Emily Flake We talk so much about how the pandemic has made our lives harder. But we talk less about how it’s made some things easier, or at least how it has given us permission to slow the pace of our previously frenetic lives. Quarantine permissiveness takes many forms, some hedonistic — why not have cake for lunch? It’s quarantine! And some shading close to despair — who cares if I eat, shower or get out of bed? It’s quarantine! But it’s in my parenting that the idea of lowered standards keeps me up at night. Some rule loosening is an inevitable consequence of constricted mental bandwidth. Many of us just don’t have the energy to insist on the completion of every single online assignment across a multitude of goofily-named platforms, or to shepherd a child into making her bed every day. But as a parent, I can’t permanently abdicate responsibility for raising my daughter to be a decent adult, even if it feels optimistic to assume she’ll be an adult in a world where decency is prized. As a Gen Xer, I am primed for nihilism. But I would hate to find that a decade from now, the world hasn’t ended and I’ve wound up broke, out-of-shape and having raised a brat. It’s the behavioral piece I truly need to figure out, more than anything else. My own 8-year-old daughter has leaned hard into the idea that these are extraordinary times. “You don’t know what it’s like to be a kid during Covid!” she wails, sometimes in response to being asked to brush her teeth. This is true, but I also know that as weird and dislocating as these times are, most generations have faced something at least as terrible, and dental hygiene is important. I adore my daughter and genuinely enjoy spending time with her, but these days there’s both an adolescent tang to her back-talk and a toddler-like regression in the way she gets upset, and neither bode well for the future. One rejoinder to being told it was time to go to bed was to tell me she doesn’t even want her life anymore, and “You can just TAKE it, Mom.” I didn’t know whether to laugh at the absurdity of that or to place a call to emergency psych services.
