The police said officers were initially responding to a reported bomb threat. By Christina Morales Two people were killed and two others injured in a shooting on Saturday night at a Nebraska Sonic Drive-In, the authorities said. Officers from the Bellevue Police Department were called to the restaurant, about nine miles from Omaha, Neb., at approximately 9:23 p.m. about a possible bomb inside of a moving truck in the parking lot, the police said. The bomb squad was dispatched, Lt. Andy Jashinske of the Bellevue Police Department said at a news conference. He said there was a truck “and maybe some fireworks or some type of device in it” at the restaurant’s parking lot. “We are still trying to figure this out,” he said. A minute later, the call was updated to involve a shooting. Officers found four people with gunshot wounds, the police said. Two people were transported to the University of Nebraska Medical Center and two others were declared dead at the scene. Details on the identities, ages and conditions of the victims were not provided by the police. A suspect, Roberto Carlos Silva, 23, was quickly taken into custody, the police said. He was charged with first-degree murder and first-degree arson. In a statement, a Sonic Drive-In spokesman said the company was “stunned and saddened by what occurred” and that the franchise owner was working with the authorities. “Our heartfelt condolences go out to the franchise owner and the families and friends impacted by this horrific tragedy,” the spokesman said. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
