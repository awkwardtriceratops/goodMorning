Psychologists say conjuring nostalgia during stressful times is a healthy coping mechanism. The 1985 movie “The Goonies” was a favorite this summer.Credit...Kevin Coombs/Reuters Supported by By Jenny Gross Dr. Libby Torchia’s pandemic breaking point came one morning in May, when she and her boss got into an argument over whether staff members should wear masks at the Columbus, Ohio, clinic where they worked. (“We should!” said Dr. Torchia, 32, a veterinarian.) Her colleagues knew just how to comfort her: Blast the Spice Girls’ hit song “Wannabe.” From the surgical suite where they were about to spay a dog, they broke into a dance party. “It really helped to bring my focus back, and made me feel a lot happier and just kind of let go of all of the conflict,” Dr. Torchia said. Some people swear by silent breakfasts. Others recommend breathing exercises. For another group of people, the ultimate coping mechanism for political angst and the pandemic is escaping into a world of yesteryear — listening to 1990s hits, watching old films and playing 16-bit video games. When everything has turned upside down, why not go back to a time when the world seemed simpler? It’s not just Spice Girls and Fleetwood Mac that are having moments. “Jurassic Park” (1993), “Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back” (1980), “Hocus Pocus” (1993) and “The Goonies” (1985) have hit box office charts over the past few months, pulling in thousands of dollars in ticket sales, especially at drive-in screens where social distancing is easier. “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” (1982) dominated an evening’s conversation on Twitter after Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and other celebrities re-enacted it in a virtual table reading. These throwbacks have not had much competition, admittedly, since many major movie studios have delayed releases until next year or later. But people are harking back to old favorites not just because there is nothing else to watch or do. These films and songs offer solace and predictability in a time when each week seems to bring unpleasant surprises.
