Here’s How It Went.<br></h1><p id="artcont">CRITIC’S NOTEBOOK Our critics examine the highs, the lows and the oddities of the online versions of events in Toronto and New York. By Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott The Toronto International Film Festival ended its largely virtual edition on Saturday, and the largely virtual New York Film Festival is in progress, through Oct. 11. We asked our critics what it’s like to attend events like these from your living room. MANOHLA DARGIS If this were a normal year (I hate typing those words), you would have already filed your critic’s notebook on the Telluride Film Festival, I would have filed mine on Toronto, and we’d be starting our coverage of New York. We would have seen dozens of movies, caught up with festival friends and have had a considered grasp on the rest of the film year — its aesthetic highlights, awards-hungry atrocities and our top 10 (20!) candidates. Instead, we have streamed and paused and shut off a whole lot of movies in our homes. I’m very grateful to see so much new work. But no matter how organizers frame this year’s events, and however enthusiastically they roll out their virtual red carpets, none of this remotely approaches the experiences of an in-person festival like Toronto — which I greatly missed attending. You? A.O. SCOTT In principle, yes, but the idea of taking an airplane to a faraway place and spending 12 hours a day in overcrowded screening rooms, news conferences and parties fills me with dread. In some ways it always did. Seeing four or five movies a day, juggling deadlines and managing expectations, trying to take note of the buzz and tune it out at the same time — festivals are not necessarily ideal settings for the discerning appreciation of cinema. Maybe that isn’t their primary function these days. Telluride (which was canceled this year), Toronto, Venice and New York play an important role in setting up the fall and holiday movie seasons, and of course (alas) the Oscars race. Even when our coverage is pushing against that hype, we can’t help but be aware of it; it’s why the stars show up for gala screenings and Q. and A. sessions, and why The New York Times pays our airfare. The pandemic has upended that rationale. The sense of anticipation and discovery — of encountering movies at the start of their progress through the world — is missing this year. And to be honest I’m not sure what being “at” a festival means in these conditions. DARGIS It means grumbling in solitary despair rather than in hostile solidarity, something I long for. More than anything it is the communal experience — other people — that makes a film festival, maybe even more than the selections. I mean, you do need movies even if some festivals show TV. That’s fine, sure, whatever. But I love the rituals, spaces and excited throngs at festivals. I miss my congregation and vibrating alongside people who, at Toronto, I could have shared my contempt for Michel Franco’s nitwit provocation “New Order” and my fondness for Matthew Heineman’s documentary “The Boy From Medellín,” on the reggaeton star J Balvin. Even the suboptimal visual quality of streaming can’t keep a good movie down, it turns out, even when the poor images produce something like VHS PTSD. One of the best I saw via Toronto is “76 Days,” a tough, very good Chinese documentary about the first months of the pandemic in Wuhan. (It was directed by Hao Wu, Weixi Chen and anonymous collaborators.) It felt eerie watching the movie in Los Angeles at home by myself, partly because it’s about something that has forced me into near-lockdown over the past six months. It also made me cry, especially when ambulances were blaring onscreen — I kept wanting to call you in New York because it reminded me of how I’d hear sirens whenever we talked on the phone in April.
