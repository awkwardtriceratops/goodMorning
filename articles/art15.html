Neither injury was life threatening. By Ashley Southall A woman walked into a Queens police station on Tuesday with an alarming complaint: her husband had attacked her the night before over accusations of infidelity, she told the police. A pair of domestic violence officers escorted the woman back to her house on 179th Street in Jamaica early in the afternoon, but it seemed her husband, Rondell Goppy, had left before they arrived. Six minutes later, around 12:45 p.m., he showed up armed with two guns and started shooting at the officers, who returned fire. One of the officers was shot in the right thigh and the other in both hands. Mr. Goppy, 41, was killed. His wife, also 41, was not injured, the police said. Police Commissioner Dermot F. Shea said detectives were still investigating what prompted Mr. Goppy, a college public-safety officer, to open fire on the officers.   In a news conference outside the hospital where the officers were expected to undergo surgery, Mr. Shea said the police had been called to the home several times in the past, although Mr. Goppy had no criminal history and was licensed to own firearms. “Whether he was laying in wait or just happened to arrive at that time, will be part of the investigation,” Mr. Shea said. The police commissioner said it was unclear why Mr. Goppy had been allowed to keep the three guns he owned legally after the previous domestic violence calls. He said investigators would be looking into what happened. Under New York State law, the authorities can obtain a court order allowing them to confiscate legally owned weapons if they believe the owners pose a danger to themselves or others. The so-called red-flag law went into effect in 2019 and has rarely been used. Mr. Goppy was previously forced to give up his guns under circumstances that remain unclear, but they were later returned to him, according to a police official briefed on the investigation. Mr. Shea said the officer shot in the thigh had a shattered femur. Both officers were awake and alert at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, he said. “Both require surgeries for their very serious injuries, and we’re hoping for a full recovery,” he said, adding that the shooting was “a stark reminder” of the dangers police officers face in the line of duty. Mr. Goppy worked as a crime prevention specialist at City College in Manhattan, according to the school’s website. He and his wife bought the home on 179th Street two years after they married, according to the police and public records. The couple have two children together, who were home attending school remotely when the shooting unfolded, the woman’s mother, Donna Cameron, said. Ms. Cameron said her daughter ran to the basement after the shooting and called her on the phone. “She said ‘Mommy! Mommy! He tried to shoot me, and he shoot the police,’” Ms. Cameron said. “I said, ‘Stay in the basement, stay in the basement, I’ll come.’” Ms. Cameron said she immediately drove to New York from her home in Philadelphia with the woman’s sister, Eulene Cameron.   The sister said that the abuse “had been going on for years,” but the family only learned about it over the summer. “We were mad, we were upset, but she didn’t want us to get involved,” Eulene Cameron said. “We’ve been trying to get her out for so long, but she was not leaving because she did not want her kids to suffer.” Police officers swarmed the house on Tuesday and used police tape to cordon off the dead end portion of 146th Road leading to its entrance. Investigators found two of Mr. Goppy’s guns at the house and one at another location, Mr. Shea said. Mayor Bill de Blasio, at the hospital, praised the officers for their bravery in taking on an assignment that is often unpredictable and sometimes dangerous. “Here we have a situation where a woman was in danger, and these officers went to protect her, only to find themselves in harm’s way immediately,” he said. Police respond to thousands of domestic violence calls each month, but few escalate to complaints of assault. Between January and September, police responded to 142,586 such calls and recorded 5,868 felony assaults, according to the most recent police totals. The police have also recorded fewer domestic violence crimes this year compared to last year, but the authorities and aid groups that work with victims say those decreases may mask an underreported problem. The declines have been attributed to victims being isolated with their abusers during the pandemic, which also forced police to stop conducting home visits and the courts to temporarily close. Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association, used the shootings to ridicule recent calls from protesters to defund the police and, in some situations, replace them with social workers on emergency calls. “We can’t be removed," he said. “We need to be there.” The news of the shooting sent shock waves through the neighborhood where the couple lived near Kennedy International Airport. Sabyasachi Kundu, who lives next door to the couple, said he was “very surprised” by the shooting. He and Mr. Goppy had helped to form the neighborhood block association and worked together to put on small events like block parties and potlucks, he said. A Facebook post identified Mr. Goppy as the president of the Diversity Unity Block Association, with a photo of him and his wife, Mr. Kunda and two other organizers, wearing matching black T-shirts. “The family that we know, this is the least of our expectations,” he said. “But obviously, we don’t know what’s going on inside.” Outside the house on Tuesday, officers lifted the tape to admit detectives and commanders to the crime scene, which was surrounded for blocks by police cars and a vehicle from the medical examiner’s office.
