Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Wednesday. Weather: Mixed sun and clouds, with a stray shower. High around 80. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Sept. 7 (Labor Day). Read about the amended regulations here. In mere weeks, New York City’s 1.1 million schoolchildren are set to return to classrooms part time. Reopening public schools on Sept. 10 would not only be crucial for vulnerable students but pivotal in helping to repair the pandemic-ravaged economy, as many parents would be able to return to work. Still, as we inch toward that date, principals, teachers and others are continuing to raise concerns about the threat of the coronavirus. Mayor Bill de Blasio may be the only big-city mayor attempting some in-person learning this fall, and now he’s facing mounting pressure to delay that plan. [Getting the virus under control in New York is only the first step to opening schools.] The city, no longer an epicenter of the pandemic, is planning a hybrid learning model, with students returning to school for a only few days each week to allow for social distancing. That plan has proved to be a logistical challenge. Principals, for instance, have said that they don’t know how many students will show up on Sept. 10 because there isn’t a deadline for families to opt in for some in-person classes or all-remote learning. So far, about 30 percent of families have said they would start the academic year remotely, but that number may change, making it almost impossible to plan class schedules and determine how many teachers schools will need. My colleague Eliza Shapiro, who covers education, wrote recently that the city’s biggest obstacle is time. Principals have only two work days in September to meet with teachers for staffing decisions, and questions about classroom ventilation and how to test students and faculty members for the coronavirus largely remain unanswered. “A delayed start to in-person classes is beginning to feel like more of a ‘when’ than an ‘if,’” she said. A school district outside of Phoenix temporarily canceled classes after teachers and staff members called out sick to protest in-person schooling. Near Oklahoma City, an infected student went to school before his 14-day quarantine was over, NBC News reported. Now, dozens of students there are in quarantine. In Cherokee County, Georgia, more than 2,000 students and staff members were ordered to quarantine because of large numbers of coronavirus cases. In Los Angeles — home to the nation’s second-largest school system, behind New York City — children started virtual classes on Monday. The district also has an ambitious program to test its 700,000 students and 75,000 employees for the virus. In New York, many out-of-state college students must quarantine in the state for 14 days before attending classes. That has left families scrambling to find arrangements to do so. Tanja Chevalier, whose daughter attends Syracuse University, was confused about what do when her home state, Illinois, was added to New York’s mandatory quarantine list. It was too late for her daughter to sign up for on-campus quarantine housing. “I don’t even know what moves to make,” Ms. Chevalier told my colleague Troy Closson. Elsewhere, The Times has identified more than 250 cases tied to Greek life at universities across the country. Fraternities have thrown parties, and sorority members at University of Alabama have filled bars. And at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, officials swiftly called off in-person classes because of outbreaks.

[Gothamist] Updated August 17, 2020 The Times’s Melissa Guerrero writes: At a moment when small businesses in New York City are closing, Edy’s Grocer has opened its doors for the first time. Edy Massih, the chef and owner, last week held a sneak preview of the Lebanese grocery and deli in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, helping to raise money for the victims of the Beirut explosion. Lines wrapped around the corner, he said, and the store sold out of “literally every single thing.” The green-and-pink space is a spot for drip coffee, riz a jej (a chicken-and-rice dish) and many other Lebanese staples. But it is also a place to find Polish delicacies: The grocery was previously Maria’s Deli, a longtime Polish market owned by his friend Maria Puk. “Maria’s like a grandmother to me,” Mr. Massih said. He was a regular at Maria’s Deli and had befriended Ms. Puk over coffee. Mr. Massih, who has appeared on the reality television show “Chopped,” said he had always joked with Ms. Puk about taking over the store when she retired. After the pandemic devastated New York, his catering business slowed down and he more formally proposed the idea to Ms. Puk. At first she declined, saying she wasn’t ready. But by Memorial Day weekend, Ms. Puk, who is in her 60s, had changed her mind. Soon, she and Mr. Massih were working to create Edy’s Grocer. The two friends have also bonded over their experience as immigrants: Ms. Puk moved to United States from Poland at age 10; Mr. Massih came from Lebanon at the same age. She took over the storefront at age 24, and he took it over at 25. “I’m trying to bring my grandmother’s recipes to life, and I want to keep her recipes alive as well, because she’s been a really big impact in the neighborhood,” Mr. Massih said. “She’s had history here. And I want to keep that history alive.” It’s Wednesday — dig in. Dear Diary: My girlfriend and I were on a D train going from Brooklyn into Manhattan. Next to us in the crowded car was a young man who was standing near the window and looking out. As we got close to the Manhattan Bridge, a man with a small boy approached the young man and asked whether he could move aside a little so that his son could also look out the window. “He lives for this,” the father said with a smile. “Yeah,” the young man said while making space. “Me too.” He and the boy stood there side by side as we crossed the bridge and watched Manhattan come closer into view. — Moritz Schäfer New York Today is published weekdays around 6 a.m. Sign up here to get it by email.
