It did not lift their rent obligation. By Matthew Goldstein The Trump administration announced an order on Tuesday to bar evictions for most renters for the rest of the year as the nation grapples with the coronavirus pandemic. The order, put forward by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the action was needed to stop the spread of the virus and to avoid having renters wind up in shelters or other crowded living conditions, compounding the crisis. The moratorium would go further than the eviction ban under the pandemic CARES Act, which covered as many as 12.3 million renters in apartment complexes or single-family homes financed with federally backed mortgages. That provision expired in July, though landlords could not begin eviction proceedings for 30 days. To apply for the new moratorium, tenants will have to attest to a substantial loss of household income, the inability to pay full rent and best efforts to pay partial rent. Tenants must also stipulate that eviction would be likely to leave them homeless or force them to live with others at close quarters. Forms will be available on the C.D.C. website once the order is published in the Federal Register. The order provides for criminal penalties for violations, but it does not relieve tenants of their ultimate obligation to pay rent. It applies to those who expect to earn no more than $99,000 this year or who meet other income limits. Tenant advocacy groups have said millions could face eviction in the coming months without government intervention. Negotiations on Capitol Hill to renew aspects of the CARES Act, which was passed in March, have been fruitless. In announcing the eviction moratorium, the Trump administration took a swipe at Democrats for the impasse in negotiations. Brian Morgenstern, deputy White House press secretary, said that while congressional Democrats “play games,” President Trump “is helping families overcome unprecedented challenges.” The National Low Income Housing Coalition, a policy group focused on affordable housing, welcomed the order but said further action was needed to provide financial relief to struggling renters.
