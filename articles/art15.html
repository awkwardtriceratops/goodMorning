The family, she told him, will not be traveling to his grandfather’s house in Miami to celebrate Iranian New Year like they usually do. He might become infected, but not know. He won’t be able to go to school or see friends for, well, who knows how long. But he can still enjoy bike rides around the neighborhood or swimming in their backyard pool. For the first month or two, Roman appeared fine with life in the bubble, as he hunched over the dining room table for hours writing screenplays for a stop-action film starring his “Star Wars” figurines. As the months dragged on, however, he seemed a little too fine with life inside the bubble. “Now,” Ms. Kian, 37, said, “he doesn’t want to leave the four walls of this house. He doesn’t even want to go to the backyard. If I want him to go with the pool, I have to beg.” “My son,” she added, “who was a pretty introverted kid pre-Covid, has turned into a hermit.” After more than a half-year of virtual house arrest, some adults crave nothing more than escape into the broader world beyond four walls. For some younger children, however, the topic is a little more complicated. Faced with a world of ominous warnings, masks, and playgrounds barricaded by yellow tape, some crave the security and familiarity of home — so desperately, it seems, that parents find themselves resorting to pleas, threats, or bribes to drag them out of the house, with highly mixed results.
