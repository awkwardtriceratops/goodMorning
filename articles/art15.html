We asked readers what they were missing as fans in the stands. By The New York Times Live sports are back. Live fans are (mostly) not. You can catch some spectators projected digitally at N.B.A. games or cardboard cutouts “seated” in Major League Baseball stadiums. But it’s not the same. The echoing “DEE-FENSE” chant can’t be heard in arenas or on TV broadcasts. Players don’t hear the roar for a home run, and there is no chest-pounding for thousands of adoring fans. As live sports began returning in the United States, The New York Times asked sports fans to share what they missed about going to games. Responses were both wistful and hopeful. Readers said they longed for the simple pleasure of a minor league baseball game with family and the euphoria of witnessing a hometown team advance to the playoffs. Many expressed hope that it would someday feel normal again to hug strangers after a sweet victory or a devastating defeat. Here is a selection of responses, edited for clarity and length. PETER MASTRIPPOLITO, WASHINGTON D.C. After over seven innings of palpable tension and despair in the crowd, Juan Soto’s base-clearing hit to give the Nationals the lead against the Milwaukee Brewers in their National League wild-card game last year was like throwing a Molotov cocktail into a fireworks factory. I’ve never been so elated at a game, and I’ve never seen a crowd go as crazy as the Nationals fans did that night. I still rewatch Soto’s hit and still can’t believe that the Nationals won that night, let alone the World Series a few weeks later. I can’t imagine a moment like that having the same impact without the 40,000 people there experiencing the same emotions. Everyone was chanting “Beat L.A.” as we left the ballpark. It felt like the whole city believed in the team. ALYZE BELLUCCI, EL DORADO HILLS, CALIF. In late January, my 9-year-old son and I attended the San Francisco 49ers’ N.F.C. championship game, which led them to the Super Bowl. We had the most amazing time and we did not sit down for a single defensive play as the 49ers dominated the Green Bay Packers. We woke up the next morning with hoarse, raspy voices from screaming and cheering. It’s hard to believe now that earlier this year we were closely packed in with more than 60,000 people and not remotely concerned. Before I had children, I worked in the front office of two Major League Baseball teams. Fans in attendance, both from my personal and past professional experiences, are a huge part of the game. I miss sports with all my heart … from my son’s Little League team to the San Francisco Giants’ season. TARYN SHANES, PLANO, TEXAS In 2010, at 12 years old, I was standing alongside my dad and thousands of Texas Rangers fans as we witnessed the first American League Championship Series win in franchise history. Updated Aug. 19, 2020 Here’s what’s happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to life: I wish I had recorded more of the crowd reaction: Kids cheering at the fireworks, crisp high-fives between strangers, grown men gruffly embracing each other and pretending not to notice the tears.
