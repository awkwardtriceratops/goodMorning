It Never Happened.<br></h1><p id="artcont">In 2016, agency scientists deemed hair straighteners containing formaldehyde to be unsafe, according to newly obtained emails. By Roni Caryn Rabin It’s been more than a decade since a popular hair treatment called Brazilian Blowout appeared in salons, promising months of straight hair after a single application. But soon users were complaining that the product emitted noxious fumes that stung their eyes, brought on headaches, nosebleeds and nausea, and made it hard to breathe. Government health inspectors said the culprit was formaldehyde, a chemical that has been linked to cancer. Although the labels on the bottles claimed the product was “formaldehyde-free,” it contained a solution called methylene glycol, which converts to formaldehyde gas after coming in contact with air. The Food and Drug Administration has allowed Brazilian Blowout and similar products, called keratin treatments, to remain on the market despite the recommendations of its own scientists, according to internal agency emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the advocacy group Environmental Working Group and shared with The New York Times. F.D.A. scientists deemed hair straighteners with formaldehyde unsafe in 2016, and agency lawyers started drafting rules for a proposed ban, the emails show. “This is a very big deal for us, and for the public,” an agency scientist wrote to her colleagues on July 26, 2016. But a ban never happened. Internal emails about the drafting of new rules continued for a few months before the process appears to have abruptly halted. F.D.A. officials have not yet provided the Environmental Working Group with any internal documents or communications on the topic written after December 2016, despite the group’s request. An F.D.A. spokeswoman did not directly respond to questions about why the agency’s move to ban hair straightening products with formaldehyde stalled, saying only that the agency’s Center for Food Safety and Nutrition considered a rule “as one of several potential actions.” She said the cosmetics division had shifted its attention to tattoo inks, talc and allergens in makeup. The revelations of the intended ban come at a time when public trust in the F.D.A., the agency responsible for reviewing the safety of coronavirus therapies and vaccines, has been shaken. Critics have questioned the agency’s emergency approval of Covid-19 treatments, and many Americans fear the agency is being pressured to prematurely authorize a coronavirus vaccine. Susan Mayne, who heads the center that oversees cosmetics, was one of several senior F.D.A. officials who recently wrote an article in USA Today pledging to make decisions about the safety and effectiveness of Covid-19 treatments and vaccines based on the available science. She declined a request for an interview about the agency’s handling of the hair straighteners. The National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, has noted links between formaldehyde and cancer. Studies of workers exposed to high levels of formaldehyde, like embalmers, have found an increased risk of myeloid leukemia and rare cancers of the nose and pharynx. Even the cosmetics industry’s own expert panel, asked in 2011 by the F.D.A. to evaluate the safety of the hair straighteners, concluded it is unsafe to use formaldehyde in products designed to be used with heat, such as blow dryers or flat irons. To use the products safely, “you’d have to do the treatments in a wind tunnel,” said Bart Heldreth, executive director of the group, called the Cosmetic Ingredient Review, which was created and funded by the cosmetics industry’s trade association, the Personal Care Products Council.
