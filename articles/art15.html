It’s Both<br></h1><p id="artcont">Credit...Diana Markosian Supported by By Jonathan Griffin LOS ANGELES — In a soundstage on a quiet street in Glendale, Calif., a whisper passed among the crew. Svetlana, the director’s mother, had arrived. It was April 2018, and the photographer Diana Markosian, then 28, was directing her first short film — the centerpiece of her autofictional project titled “Santa Barbara.” She had invited me to witness the beginning of this ambitious and multidimensional work, named both for the campy television soap opera of the ’80s and ’90s, and the town where she spent much of her childhood. Over the next two years, I followed “Santa Barbara” as it grew to include a series of photographs, a book that will be released by Aperture in November, and an exhibition of images, videos and installations that will debut in February at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Shooting took Ms. Markosian and her crew to locations across California, from Santa Barbara to Palm Springs and the Mojave Desert, and eventually to Yerevan, Armenia. “Santa Barbara” is based on Ms. Markosian’s dramatic reconstruction of her exodus from post-Soviet Russia with her mother, Svetlana, and older brother, David, when she was 7. The three settled in Santa Barbara with a man named Eli, whom Ms. Markosian came to call “Dad.” She did not see her biological father again for 15 years.
