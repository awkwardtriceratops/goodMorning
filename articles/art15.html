By Gail Collins and Bret Stephens Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every week. Bret Stephens: Good morning, Gail. I was reading on social media that Osama bin Laden is alive and well and that he’s living inside Donald Trump’s brain. Care to comment? Gail Collins: Bret, we’ve spent a lot of time listening to Trump trying to destroy Barack Obama’s legacy. Obama didn’t save the auto industry — he did. Obama didn’t resuscitate the economy — he did. Obama didn’t fix health care for veterans — he did. Bret: And now, thanks to a Trump retweet of a bonkers-despicable-QAnon-linked conspiracy theory, we have: the United States didn’t actually kill Bin Laden, but Biden killed the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden’s body double. Eventually, “Jeopardy!” will have a category called “Trump’s Lowest Twitter Moment” and that will be the daily double. Gail: Lately, when he goes into one of those rants, I relax by picturing the moment when we get to say: “Obama got elected to a second term — you didn’t.” Bret: Inshallah. Gail: Speaking of the competition between Trump and Biden, what did you think of those town hall pseudo debates? Bret: I think they’re a public service. Biden continues to dispel the myth that he no longer has a brain. And Trump continues to dispel the myth that he’s ever had a heart. The more voters are reminded of these two facts between now and the election, the likelier we are to send Trump into permanent exile in Mar-a-Lago or wherever else he goes from here. Gail: Well thanks to great reporting from our Times colleagues, we are able to hope that the first place he goes from here is bankruptcy. Bret: From Here to Bankruptcy? Wasn’t that a film with Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift? Gail: If it was a new version, we’d have to watch the scene where Trump goes to the beach and embraces Melania (or Stormy? Or someone in between?) in the waves. Definitely don’t want to go there. Bret: In the meantime, it looks like Amy Coney Barrett is heading toward confirmation, and some progressives are advocating all manner of retaliation against Republicans for pushing the nomination through: ending the Senate filibuster for legislation, packing the Supreme Court, even pushing for statehood for Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. All this assumes Democrats win back the Senate and the White House. If they do, is any of that warranted or wise? Gail: None of those would be on the top of my priority list, but I can understand why they’re coming up. The way the Republicans have handled court appointments is shocking, including their decision to break all the precedents they set during the Obama administration and ram Barrett through just days before the election. Bret: Well, I wouldn’t object to any president’s right to nominate a justice at any point in his presidency if Mitch McConnell hadn’t held up Merrick Garland’s nomination to replace Antonin Scalia on transparently bogus grounds. But the hypocrisy rankles and reeks. If Senate Republicans had integrity — ha! — they would have held themselves to their own standard and held the nomination until after January. Gail: The filibuster tradition — one Senator stopping a bill from coming up to vote by just refusing to stop speaking — calls up a lovely vision of Jimmy Stewart in “Mr. Smith Goes To Washington” talking for 23 hours in order to fight corruption and get children a summer camp. Classic movie, which was made in 1939. About 10 people under the age of 60 have seen it. We don’t live in a Mr. Smith world. We live in a world where the filibuster means Ted Cruz trying to stop health care legislation. Bret: It would be a mistake to abolish the filibuster outright. I know lots of Democrats who privately regret Harry Reid’s decision, back when he was the Democratic majority leader in 2013, to end the filibuster for federal judgeships and executive branch appointments. That set up Republicans to end it for Supreme Court nominees a few years later. We’ve just wound up in a race to the bottom.
