By his estimate he has handed out around 26,000 signs, put together with the help of his family. Mr. Mitchko, a former factory worker, might seem like the kind of voter Joseph R. Biden Jr. wants to peel away from the Republicans in November. He had always been a Democrat — he voted for Barack Obama twice — but opted for Donald Trump in 2016. “It’s like they want nothing to do with the people right now,” he said of the Democratic Party. “So me and my wife left the party. We went down and joined the Republican side and that’s it.” Today, we speak to voters and politicians on the ground in northeastern Pennsylvania, exploring the factors that swung former Democratic strongholds toward Mr. Trump and asking whether Mr. Biden can win them back.
