He’s seen here via FaceTime from his home in Honolulu, Hawaii.Credit...Tayler Smith for The New York Times Supported by By Rachel Strugatz St. Ives was all the rage when Letizia Timoni was in middle school. Letizia, now 16, and most of her friends used its exfoliating face scrub that smells like apricots and sloughs off the topmost layers of skin with ground walnut shells. As recently as February, St. Ives face masks and face washes were a part of her skin care regimen. A month later she found Hyram Yarbro and threw it all out. Mr. Yarbro, the purple-haired creator of Skincare by Hyram, a YouTube channel turned TikTok account, has captivated teenagers like Ms. Timoni during the pandemic with pointed product reviews, ingredient tutorials and quippy videos reacting to skin care routines of celebrities and influencers like Bella Thorne, Skai Jackson and Madison Beer. For the record, Mr. Yarbro, 24, does not approve of any of their skin care routines. His mantra is “ingredients don’t lie,” no matter the size or popularity of a brand or how famous the founder. He takes price into consideration and is uncompromising in his views on fragrance in skin care products, chemical sunscreens and face scrubs — especially St. Ives ones. “The moment Hyram came out and was so adamant about how terrible they are — he just annihilated this brand,” said Letizia, who lives in South Korea. Mr. Yarbro believes that the St. Ives scrubs are harsh on skin. They give instant gratification, leaving skin feeling smooth, he said, but ultimately cause inflammation, redness and sensitivity. (“Face scrubs in general are just trash,” he said in a May TikTok video.) In an email statement, St. Ives said: “Our St. Ives scrubs are beloved by millions.”. “While we appreciate Hyram’s opinion,” the statement added, “we respectfully disagree.” The statement continued: “We take pride in ensuring that our walnut shell powder exfoliant, used in many of our scrubs, is finely milled and polished so that each particle has a smooth surface to promote safe and effective exfoliation.” Ava Michael, 13, said she stopped using scrubs because of Mr. Yarbro. So has Chloe Ramsey, 14, and her friend Devon Blum, 12. Ava started to use Kiehl’s cleanser, and Chloe switched from a harsh sugar scrub to a cleanser with glycolic acid. None of them had heard of Skincare by Hyram until March. Now they’re all fans of serums and peels by the Ordinary, which cost about $7, and CeraVe, a drugstore brand — two of the influencer’s go-to’s. Mr. Yarbro has a business relationship with CeraVe but not with the Ordinary. “I saw companies profiting off customers’ ignorance,” Mr. Yarbro said. “At the very minimum, I started telling people that you didn’t have to pay that much money for good skin care.” MR. YARBRO’S ASCENT TO SKINFLUENCER FAME began right when people started to quarantine. Real clothes and makeup went the way of indoor dining, and interest in skin care and in-home self-care soared. In early March, Skincare by Hyram had just 100,000 TikTok followers. Today he has more than six million. “I grew up on a cattle ranch,” said Mr. Yarbro, who relocated from Arizona to Honolulu five years ago. “I thought the sun was your best friend.” Now he won’t go outside without slathering on sunscreen that is at least SPF 30. He is the authority in teenage skin care (ask anyone under 24), yet he’s not a dermatologist, chemist or aesthetician. He’s a former Saks Fifth Avenue makeup artist turned skin care fanatic who spent the last four years studying what, according to him, has amounted to thousands of ingredients. He followed dermatologists, aestheticians and chemists on social media, rabidly consuming their content and reaching out with questions. “They would call me out when I would say something wrong,” Mr. Yarbro said. “They still do now.” Early on, a follower studying to be an aesthetician corrected him about a statement he made about essential oils being good for sensitive skin (they’re not). “It was great for them to be able to say: ‘OK, Hyram, no. You do not know about these ingredients,’ or, ‘You need to know how they’re potentially harmful to the skin.’” Despite a lack of formal training, he can read a product’s label and tell you about an ingredient’s composition, its purpose, how it interacts with skin and what skin types it will work for. IT TURNS OUT THAT GEN Z is sick of traditional, P.R.-friendly beauty sponcon, easily identifiable by magic-hour light, expensive hair and flawless makeup. A poreless human is holding up the product she is being paid to promote, praising a miracle ingredient often used in such an infinitesimal amount that it could never deliver the benefits it’s purported to. It may have worked on millennials, but Skincare by Hyram fans are not interested in learning how to contour or buying whatever new palette (that looks exactly like the old palette) an influencer is selling. They want Mr. Yarbro’s opinion about Rihanna’s Fenty Skin (he’s not a big fan). But most important, he’s not beholden to brands, especially the very ones paying him for publicity. Labels like CeraVe, Kosas, Purito, Foreo and Curology have all worked with Mr. Yarbro, knowing there was a chance he would talk negatively about their products. Once, he made a sponsored Dermalogica video, “bashing them pretty hard,” he said, but “they weren’t salty about it.” His approach is working. Mr. Yarbro expects to become a multimillionaire this year. In July, he made $265,000 from online ads, affiliate sales (the cut of a sale he gets when someone buys something he links to in his content) and fees from brand partnerships, he said. Mr. Yarbro said that many brands reach out to him, and he selects about three per month. In January of last year, he made $50 from affiliate sales. “As usual, I have some controversial opinions,” Mr. Yarbro said in July during a 26-minute “The Truth About Fenty Skin” YouTube video, during which he shared the “good, the bad, and the ugly.” The good: Hydra Visor, a hybrid moisturizer and sunscreen, contains safflower oil, a “hydrating oil that’s not a fragrant essential oil,” and niacinamide. It also has refillable packaging. The bad: Hydra Visor’s strong fragrance and use of chemical UV filters. “I felt a lot of pressure to make a positive review,” he said. “It was a scary video to make. I was sweating and shaking.” In the meantime, other influencers, celebrities and beauty editors were all over social media endorsing Rihanna’s line. “Mr. Yarbro is capitalizing on things Gen Z is passionate about,” said Holly Jackson, a director at Traackr, an influencer marketing firm. She was referring to his views on sustainability, the environmental impact of ingredients and affordable recommendations, like the Ordinary’s AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, which costs $7.20. Mr. Yarbro often talks about the label, and not because he is paid to do so, although the company has sent him products. “I’m surprised no big brand has come after him or a celebrity,” Ms. Timoni said. “He says it in a very light-hearted way, but he is also putting down a product. Yet somehow people still love him.” Mr. Yarbro talked about CeraVe products for months before the company reached out to ask if he would work with them in a paid capacity, he said. “It’s our first stab at speaking to someone that’s 100 percent aligned with Gen Z,” said Tom Allison, a CeraVe founder. Before that, CeraVe reached Gen Z only through physician recommendations, Mr. Allison said. The company dabbled in social media, but early efforts were geared toward millennials. The first sponsored content appeared in June and again in August. “It was super-clear he was a major force in the skin care realm when we started seeing people buy CeraVe,” said Michelle Miller, the vice president for marketing at Kosas, a makeup label that did a sponsorship with Mr. Yarbro in July. Because of Skincare by Hyram, Ms. Miller, 36, bought CeraVe and the Ordinary. Sales on the Kosas website tripled within 48 hours of a Skincare by Hyram mention, she said. “He’s a golden Cheez-It,” Ms. Miller said. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
