In doing so, they have regularly exaggerated Mr. Trump’s accomplishments in office, glossed over or misled about his efforts in confronting the coronavirus pandemic and twisted the record of his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. A team of New York Times reporters are following the developments and fact-checking the speakers, providing context and explanation. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg — President Trump A report by the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services in the early days of the pandemic found serious problems with the supplies shipped from the strategic national stockpile. “Some hospitals noted that at the time of our interview they had not received supplies from the Strategic National Stockpile, or that the supplies that they had received were not sufficient in quantity or quality,” the inspector general wrote. One administrator stated that getting supplies from the stockpile was a major challenge, saying that the supplies the hospital received “won’t even last a day. We need gloves, we need masks with fluid shields on — N95 masks — and we need gowns.” By Michael Crowley — President Trump Mr. Biden suggested that the senior Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, deserved to be killed — but doubted the intelligence that Mr. Trump used to justify the strike and warned it could lead to dangerous military escalation. Hours after the Jan. 2 missile strike that killed Mr. Soleimani, Mr. Biden issued a statement highly critical of the operation. Although he said that Mr. Soleimani “deserved to be brought to justice for his crimes against American troops and thousands of innocents throughout the region,” Mr. Biden called the strike “a hugely escalatory move in an already dangerous region.” In a Democratic debate the next month, Mr. Biden implied that he might have supported the killing if he believed that Mr. Soleimani was plotting an imminent attack on Americans in the Middle East as Mr. Trump claimed. But, he said, “the reason I wouldn’t have ordered the strike is there isn’t any evidence yet of an imminent strike that was going to come from him.” Mr. Biden has also said that Mr. Trump “flat-out lied” about the underlying intelligence, which has never been made public and which members of Congress who have seen it have also questioned. In his initial statement, Mr. Biden warned that “we could be on the brink of a major conflict across the Middle East,” but that has not materialized. By Ana Swanson — President Trump President Trump has consistently tried to distance the trade deals he has updated or revised from their earlier iterations that were written by other administrations. But the revised trade deal with South Korea that Mr. Trump signed in 2018 is a minor update to what he refers to as “the horrendous South Korea trade deal.” That pact included steps to open up the Korean market to increased American exports, most notably for automobiles, but there were few other fundamental changes to the existing agreement. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement was a more significant transformation of its predecessor, the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. But while the 2,082-page pact includes some important changes in key areas, like incentives to make cars in North America and reforms to Mexican labor rules, it’s also fair to describe it as an update of the original NAFTA pact. Much of the new agreement simply updates the pre-existing deal with new laws on the internet, intellectual property protection, state-owned enterprises and currency. And much of that updated language was itself taken from the negotiated text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump derides. By Linda Qiu — President Trump The Veterans Choice Program was created in 2014 after the scandal of hidden waiting lists at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. In 2018, Mr. Trump signed a law that overhauled and consolidated Veterans Choice and other existing programs into a single Veterans Community Care Program. It is unclear what poll Mr. Trump is referring to, but 57 percent of veterans approved of Mr. Trump’s handling of his duties as commander-in-chief and 92 percent of Republican veterans approved, according a 2019 poll from the Pew Research Center. By Coral Davenport — President Trump While President Trump did withdraw the United States from the Paris climate change agreement — a move that was not legally initiated until 2019 — the pact, which includes nearly every other nation on earth, remains intact without the participation of the United States. It is not accurate to say that the United States is “energy independent,” a phrase that suggests that the United States is independent of reliance on imported energy sources. In 2019, nearly half the oil consumed by the United States was imported — about 9 million barrels per day were imported of the roughly 20 million barrels per day that were consumed, according to the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department. By Eric Schmitt — President Trump Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to end wars in the Middle East and Southwest Asia but has yet to fulfill this promise. In February, the United States signed a deal with the Taliban laying out a timetable for the final withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan within 12 to 14 months if the insurgent group met certain conditions. In recent months, Mr. Trump has repeatedly voiced a desire to leave Afghanistan sooner than that. A few weeks ago, Mr. Trump said there would be fewer than 5,000 American troops in Afghanistan by Election Day in November. There are currently about 8,600 U.S. forces in the country. In December 2018, Mr. Trump ordered the withdrawal of 2,000 American troops from Syria. Roughly 1,000 remained by October 2019, when Mr. Trump ordered withdrawal again. A February report from the Defense Department’s inspector general estimated that 500 troops remained in northeastern Syria — including seven who were injured in a clash with Russian troops there this week .There are currently about 5,200 American troops in Iraq — about level with the 5,262 reported at the end of 2016. Though there are plans to reduce the number to as few as 2,500, there are no fixed timetables or numbers. By Linda Qiu — President Trump Not according to historians. Among modern presidents, historians agreed that the most significant legislative achievements belong to President Lyndon B. Johnson, who shepherded the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act. A 2017 study that assessed modern presidents based on the analysis of editorials published in Black newspapers ranked Mr. Johnson at the top. Mr. Trump would place in the bottom third, the study’s co-author told the Times. By Sharon LaFraniere — President Trump The race to develop a vaccine is well underway, but it is uncertain whether it will produce results by the end of the year. Dr. Anthony Fauci, an infectious disease expert and a member of the coronavirus task force, has repeatedly said it will likely be the end of 2020 or the start of 2021 before it is clear whether clinical trials were successful. Some researchers working on vaccine candidates have said getting data this year will be a real feat. Mr. Trump has been pushing hard for a faster timetable. According to two people with knowledge of the discussion, Treasury Secretary Mark Mnuchin, who sits on the coronavirus task force, suggested in a July 30 meeting with congressional leaders that the administration would likely grant emergency authorization for a vaccine before the end of phase three clinical trials in the United States. Asked about that remark, a Treasury Department spokesperson said that Mr. Mnuchin believes vaccine approval is wholly up to the Food and Drug Administration. Nonetheless, the promotion of overly optimistic scenarios by Mr. Trump and his aides has fostered deep concern that the White House will try to influence the vaccine approval process for political reasons. By Linda Qiu — President Trump For four years, President Trump has consistently misstated how defense spending in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization works. He is referring to the projected military spending of NATO, which is expected to be $400 billion more by 2024, compared with 2016. It is not a “payment” paid to NATO by its members. As of November 2019, nine countries, including the United States, had met the NATO goal of each member spending at least 2 percent of its gross domestic product on its own defense. That’s up from five countries in 2016. Mr. Trump can take some credit for urging other countries to meet that goal, but it’s worth noting that the members had in 2014 already pledged to meet the 2 percent goal by 2024. By Jeanna Smialek — Ivanka Trump, President Trump’s daughter It is true that the unemployment rate was its lowest in half a century before the pandemic struck, and recent job and wage gains were especially strong for people who had long been on the sidelines, benefiting low-income workers and minority groups. But given the extreme levels of income and wealth inequality that are prevailing in the economy, it is hard to label this the “most inclusive economy” in our lifetime. Likewise, average hourly wage growth was actually stronger in decades past. Another popular measure of pay increases, the employment cost index, improved, but not to the highest level in “decades.” A wage tracker produced by the Atlanta Fed shows that across various groups, pay gains have actually been moderate by historical standards, despite recent gains. By Ana Swanson — Ivanka Trump, President Trump’s daughter The president updated the North American Free Trade Agreement to add incentives for manufacturing in the United States. But that agreement, considered a modest change to Nafta, just entered into force last month, and there is little economic evidence to suggest that his trade policies have already brought a significant number of factories or jobs back to the United States. While Mr. Trump ostensibly fought his trade war with China on behalf of American workers, economists say the trade war was actually a drag on most American factories, by increasing prices for components and inciting foreign retaliation. U.S. factory output declined throughout 2019, as Mr. Trump’s trade war intensified, and it has dropped further this year. The number of manufacturing jobs also flatlined last year after increasing in the first two years of Mr. Trump’s presidency, and fell sharply with the pandemic. After peaking in mid-2019, corporate investment declined for three consecutive quarters. Foreign direct investment into the United States — which measures spending from internationally owned companies to start, expand or acquire American businesses — sank drastically last year, to its lowest recorded level since 2006. By Mikayla Bouchard — Ivanka Trump, President Trump’s oldest daughter and a senior White House adviser In a White House ceremony, the president signed four executive orders related to drug prices last month. But none of these policies would have a dramatic impact on drug prices for most people who take prescription drugs. And all of them will require additional regulatory or state actions — which could take months or years — before they will have any effect at all. Even more, the content of one of the orders signed during the ceremony still hasn’t been made public. By Katie Benner — Rudolph Giuliani, former New York City Mayor and Mr. Trump’s personal attorney The Justice Department has indicted scores of people for rioting and related crimes, but the department’s latest compilation of criminal charges related to the nation’s ongoing protests does not include members of Black Lives Matter or Antifa, the loose coalition of self-described anti-fascist activists. While local authorities in some parts of the country have accused members of Antifa of committing crimes, the government has brought charges against men who are associated with Boogaloo, a loose coalition of radical right-wing, anti-government activists, some of whom believe that it’s their duty to take up arms to avoid a white genocide. By Edward Wong — Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas Joseph R. Biden Jr. did make those remarks on China in May 2019. That prompted criticism at the time from Republicans and some Democrats, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who was one of Mr. Biden’s challengers in the Democratic primary this year. Mr. Biden’s aides say his comment was the kind of expression of confidence in the superiority of the United States that he has made throughout his political career. And Mr. Biden has made more recent comments on China that show he sees it as a formidable challenge. He told The Washington Post this year that China is the greatest “medium-term” strategic challenge for the United States. In a Foreign Affairs essay this year, he wrote: “China represents a special challenge. I have spent many hours with its leaders, and I understand what we are up against.” He added: “The United States does need to get tough with China. If China has its way, it will keep robbing the United States and American companies of their technology and intellectual property.” Also, there is no evidence the Chinese government purposefully “unleashed” the novel coronavirus on the world. Scientists say the virus almost certainly emerged naturally, making a leap from animals to humans. And U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed in an internal report that officials in the city of Wuhan — where the initial outbreak occurred — hid the severity of the virus from officials in the central government in Beijing. By Mike Baker — Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York  Cities have at times struggled to resolve the recent unrest that Mr. Giuliani was describing, but police have continued using aggressive tactics to contain them. In Portland, where protests have persisted, officers have arrested hundreds of people, chasing them through the streets, knocking them to the ground and firing tear gas. In Seattle, leaders did retreat from the department’s East Precinct in June as part of an effort to de-escalate tensions. The city largely kept officers out of the area and allowed demonstrators to control several blocks for much of the month, but the city brought that to an end after a series of shootings around the so-called autonomous zone. Officers have since clashed with protesters and made arrests at other demonstrations. By Lara Jakes 
— Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas. An American intelligence report released earlier this month concluded that China prefers that President Trump be defeated in November. But as our colleague Julian Barnes has reported, while China seeks to gain influence in American politics, its leaders have not yet decided to wade directly into the presidential contest, however much they may dislike Mr. Trump. The intelligence report also concluded that Russia, which was assessed to favor Mr. Trump’s election, is the far graver, and more immediate, threat. By Eric Schmitt — Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas While the Islamic State has been pushed out of its so-called caliphate and its leader killed, the extremist group continues to carry out attacks in Iraq and Syria. And some of the territorial gains made by American troops and their allies took place in the Obama-Biden administration. The research firm IHS Markit estimated that the Islamic State lost about a third of its territory from January 2015 to January 2017, while Brett McGurk, the former special presidential envoy to the coalition fighting the group, has said 50 percent of those losses occurred before 2017. Officials and experts had always anticipated that the campaign, which started in 2014 during the Obama administration, would result in pushing the extremist group out of its self-declared caliphate. Mr. Cotton rightly credits Mr. Trump for ordering the strike that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in October 2019. But he overstated a claim Mr. Trump himself has repeatedly made, including in a tweet last October. “When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area,” Mr. Trump said. “We quickly defeated 100 percent of the ISIS Caliphate.” Mr. McGurk responded to the president on Twitter that “none of this is true.” By Sheryl Gay Stolberg — Ben Carson, secretary of housing and urban development It is impossible to look back through all of American history to examine the abortion views of each president; the issue did not come to the fore until the late 1960s and early 1970s, in the time leading up to the Supreme Court’s landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, the case that found a constitutional right for a woman to terminate a pregnancy. But President Trump stands alone as the president who has made the most vocal and public commitment to oppose abortion. Mr. Trump is the first and only president to address the “March for Life,” the annual demonstration that brings thousands of anti-abortion advocates to Washington each January on the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. And Mr. Trump is the only president to have made an explicit written promise to the anti-abortion movement. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group, agreed to back Mr. Trump, who in 1999 described himself as “very pro-choice.” In exchange, he provided a written promise that he would pursue an anti-abortion agenda — including “nominating pro-life justices” to the Supreme Court, and stripping Planned Parenthood of federal funding if the group continues to provide abortions. Shortly after Mr. Trump’s election, Ms. Dannenfelser said, “This is the strongest the pro-life movement has been since 1973. We are dealing now with a president who has not been playing the game in the way that other presidents, including Republicans, have.” By Eric Schmitt — Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas The Trump administration has budgeted more than $2 trillion to the defense budgets for the past three fiscal years: $671 billion in 2018, $685 billion in 2019 and $713 billion in 2020. And Mr. Trump did create a new branch of the military, the Space Force. But Mr. Cotton’s suggestion that military spending was declining before Mr. Trump took office and had seldom received such a large amount of money is wrong. Adjusted for inflation, the Pentagon operated with larger budgets than under President Trump every year from the 2007 fiscal year to 2012 fiscal year, peaking at $848 billion in 2008. Under Mr. Trump, the amount appropriated for procurement — buying and upgrading equipment — averaged $132 billion over the past three fiscal years. That is lower than the annual averages of $134 billion under President Barack Obama and $140 billion under President George W. Bush. The Trump administration has invested in operational readiness, but there are signs that the military continues to face substantial challenges in addressing an array of threats from around the world. For example, the military earned a middling grade of “marginal” last year in the conservative Heritage Foundation’s annual index of military strength, based on factors like shortages in personnel and aging equipment. The think tank noted that American forces are probably capable of meeting the demands of a single major regional conflict but “would be very hard-pressed to do more and certainly would be ill-equipped to handle two nearly simultaneous major regional contingencies.” By Lara Jakes and Eric Schmitt — Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas Mr. Cotton is repeating a charge that Vice President Mike Pence made last night, regarding the 2014 book, “Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War,” by the former Pentagon chief and C.I.A. director Robert M. Gates. In his memoir, Mr. Gates offered a scathing assessment of how the Obama administration handled the war in Afghanistan. Of Mr. Biden in particular, Mr. Gates said, “I think he’s been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.” But Mr. Cotton did not mention what Mr. Gates had written immediately before his criticism of Mr. Biden. “He’s a man of integrity, incapable of hiding what he really thinks, and one of those rare people you know you could turn to for help in a personal crisis,” Mr. Gates wrote of the then-vice president.
