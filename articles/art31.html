By Allyson Waller A junior at Texas State University lost his jobs as a bartender and a barista when the pandemic started. Now he sells instant ramen and CBD-infused baked goods that he makes in his kitchen. A senior at Vassar had some income from an internship, but it wasnâ€™t enough to keep her or her family financially secure. So she started an online tarot-reading business. A senior at Stanford used to work at his campus library until it shut down. Now he has a job with a storage marketplace start-up modeled after Airbnb.
