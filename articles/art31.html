By James E. Clyburn and Krutika Kuppalli Mr. Clyburn is the chairman of the House select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis. Dr. Kuppalli is an infectious diseases physician. This country is having to conduct an election in the midst of a pandemic that has claimed over 220,000 American lives. Fortunately for both our health and our democracy, voters have options to cast their ballot without putting their health at risk. One of us is a member of Congress, and the other is an infectious diseases physician with expertise in biosecurity and pandemic response. We have both fielded plenty of questions — from people in our state, South Carolina, and around the country — about how to safely participate in the election. Our advice is simple: Before heading to the polls, voters should make a plan to cast their ballot safely. Depending on your state, options include early in-person voting, voting by ballot drop box and voting by mail in addition to voting on Election Day. If you want to vote in person, fill out a sample ballot beforehand to reduce your time inside the polling place. All of the information you need to make a plan can be found at Vote.org. First, check your registration status. If you aren’t yet registered, in some states it is still possible to do so for this election. Once you are registered, check out your voting options by clicking on your state at the bottom of the Vote.org home page. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends early voting because it reduces crowds at polling places. Decreasing the number of people standing in line and the density of crowds on Election Day reduces the risk of coronavirus transmission, thus keeping voters and poll workers safer. Many states have expanded early voting hours on weekdays and weekends, so consider voting at an off-peak time. This election, all voters in 49 states (and many in the 50th, Mississippi) have options to cast their ballot right now — either early in person or by mail or, in some states, both — without waiting for Election Day. By Wednesday evening, more than 42 million Americans had voted, according to data collected by the United States Elections Project. If you are voting in person, follow the recommendations of public health experts to keep yourself and others healthy. Practice good hand hygiene, wear a mask and keep your distance. Come early, and be prepared to wait. Consider bringing snacks, water, something to read or listen to, and even lawn chairs and umbrellas. Be ready to spend time outdoors, since some election officials have moved check-in tables and lines outside in accordance with public health guidance. All voters have the tools they need to stay healthy when they cast their ballot this year. Ideally, states would do more to help. In a congressional hearing this fall, we urged states to open more polling sites, hire more poll workers, and arrange polling places to keep voters and poll workers safe. Yet in this year’s primaries, many states reduced the number of polling sites and struggled to recruit poll workers, leading to long lines that made it harder for thousands of Americans to cast their ballots. Many of the longest lines were in communities that have a history of disenfranchisement. Unfortunately, as Election Day approaches, we are still seeing unacceptably long lines and wait times at early voting sites in Georgia and elsewhere. Some states, like Ohio, still have not recruited enough poll workers for the general election. Long lines predictably formed outside mail-in ballot return locations this month in Texas after the governor closed down all but one per county. A battle to reopen them is in the courts. While long lines and other barriers to voting are an inexcusable continuation of the ugly history of voter suppression, voters across the country are demonstrating that they will not be stopped from participating in our democracy. Young people are signing up in droves to staff polling sites, stepping in for older poll workers who are at higher risk for coronavirus. In many states, poll workers are still needed, and it is not too late to sign up. State and local election officials should also follow evidence-based scientific guidance for safe in-person voting. Simple public health measures can make a big difference: All polling sites should offer masks and hand sanitizer and require physical distancing. Poll workers can be protected with appropriate personal protective equipment, plexiglass barriers at check-in tables, and free coronavirus testing before and after Election Day. The United States is a democracy because Americans have refused to be deterred by barriers to the ballot box. While the coronavirus pandemic poses new challenges, the response will be the same: Between now and Nov. 3, the American people can and will take the necessary steps to safely exercise their right to vote.
