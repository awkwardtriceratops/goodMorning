By Emma G. Fitzsimmons It seemed like a noble idea to offer quick help during the pandemic: New York City would give away free air-conditioners this summer to low-income older people who are stuck indoors. It turned out to be a far more complicated mission for the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio had said that his administration would install 74,000 air-conditioners by the end of July. But workers had installed about 55,800 units by mid-August — about three-fourths of the city’s goal. There were problems with some installations. Community groups say the program is disorganized and did not reach everyone it could. One center gave up waiting and bought dozens of air-conditioners on its own. The difficulty in getting a free air-conditioner left many seniors frustrated and confused by what they described as a bureaucratic, inefficient process. Concepcion Reyes, who is 67 and has asthma, said she made numerous phone calls to a handful of city agencies from her stuffy apartment last week, after seeing her neighbor snag a free air-conditioner from the city. “I’ve been in the shower two times already today,” Ms. Reyes, who lives at Holmes Towers, a public housing building on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, said last week. “I’m sweating bullets.” Mr. de Blasio’s administration has faced criticism over its ability to roll out key initiatives, including meal deliveries, coronavirus testing and a contact-tracing program to contain the virus. In some ways, the air-conditioner program could be viewed as a success: The city mobilized relatively quickly to help improve the lives of some of its neediest residents. But it also failed to meet its target goal by its deadline. A variety of factors made the program particularly challenging. First, the city tried to contact more than 450,000 households in an effort to find eligible recipients. Then the city had to order an enormous number of appliances and find enough people to install them; early on, members of the National Guard were tapped to help. The project was also mired in structural issues: Separate pieces of the program were handled by half a dozen city agencies, including four that were responsible for determining eligibility. A fifth agency, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, was charged with buying the air-conditioners. Installation was split between two agencies: The New York City Housing Authority dealt with public housing installations, while the city’s Office of Emergency Management installed units in other buildings. Adding to the confusion, the Department for the Aging sent an email to community groups earlier this month incorrectly saying that the program had ended. “Bravo!” the email said, adding that: “The GetCool project has concluded, so no more client submissions will be accepted.” After The New York Times asked City Hall about the program’s conclusion, the Department for the Aging sent another email saying the program was not, in fact, over. City officials said they were still accepting requests. Mr. de Blasio’s office defended the air-conditioner program and said another 11,600 units would be installed in the coming weeks. “There’s no precedent for ordering and installing almost 56,000 free A.C. units in three months during a pandemic,” Mitch Schwartz, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, said in a statement. “It’s a monumental undertaking — one that hasn’t been done before, and isn’t being done anywhere else.” New York City has more than 1 million residents who are 65 and older — about 14 percent of the city’s population. About 11 percent of white people over 65 live below the poverty line, compared to 28 percent of Hispanic seniors, 23 percent of Asian seniors and 18 percent of Black seniors, according to a report by the city comptroller. During the pandemic, many older people have been afraid to leave their apartments. Senior centers, where older residents gather to cool off and play bingo or mahjong, closed in March. Residents can qualify for the program if they are 60 or older, do not already have an air-conditioner and are enrolled in other city benefits programs. “There are a lot of seniors who are in limbo; they were told a long time ago that they qualified, but they’re still waiting,” said Sonal Jessel, a coordinator for WE ACT for Environmental Justice, an advocacy group. Frustrated by delays, officials at the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center in Manhattan spent nearly $30,000 on 56 air-conditioners for older people. Rosalina Acevedo, who is 73 and diabetic, had one of the units installed in her bedroom at Holmes Towers in July. When she turned it on for the first time, she instantly felt relief. “It was delicious,” she said. Gregory J. Morris, the center’s executive director, said the city should have worked with community groups that could easily have provided a list of older residents with serious health conditions who urgently needed the units. The city had its own lists, and names were missing. “They were desperate,” he said of the older people his center works with. “There was no timeline from the city. If you’re in the middle of a heat wave, do I wait longer for the city? Or do I step in and solve the problem?” Updated August 17, 2020 Helen Rosenthal, a City Council member from the Upper West Side, said her office has been helping older New Yorkers who have not been able to get an air-conditioner. “The city needs to follow through on the promises it makes,” she said. “We need to have the logistical capacity to get things done.” In June, Mr. de Blasio was optimistic about the program, known as “GetCool,” when he celebrated its early results at a news conference. In the first three weeks, the city had installed 4,000 units, he said. “The goal is to be able to install 1,500 air-conditioners each day and have all 74,000 installed by the end of July, and we are confident we can meet that goal,” the mayor said. But the city found that installing window units in creaky New York City apartments can be a vexing experience, with variable factors like window size and configuration and proximity to a suitable electrical outlet. Linda Rios got an air-conditioner after “months of pushing.” But when the workers arrived, they were too forceful and broke her window, she said. Ms. Rios, who is in her 80s and lives at the Stephen Wise Towers on the Upper West Side, said the workers argued over whether the air-conditioner would fit; it was like “something from a Laurel and Hardy comedy routine,” she said. Still, she is grateful for the cool air. “It’s a good one,” she said. “It freezes me out. I have to put a sweater on.” Her neighbor, Yves Dupiton, said workers tried to install an air-conditioner in his home, but they could not do it because his window has a gate. Mr. Dupiton, who is 69 and had heart bypass surgery, finally got a unit after The Times asked city officials about his situation. “I feel very hot,” he said before receiving the air-conditioner. “I need to cool off.” The city also had to find additional funding for the $55 million program after the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, a state agency that promotes energy efficiency, declined to help pay for it. City officials had discussions with the state agency about providing $20 million in funding, but the state decided not to contribute. Ms. Reyes did finally get her air-conditioner, after The Times inquired about her situation, as did Sherrell Walker’s 95-year-old mother, who was initially told that she was not eligible. Ms. Walker, 62, said she was laid off from her child care job in March and could not afford to pay $350 to install a unit in their apartment at Frederick Douglass Houses on the Upper West Side. She had been worried about her mother’s health. “She has a nice fan, but it’s blowing out hot air,” she said last week. “It’s horrible.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
