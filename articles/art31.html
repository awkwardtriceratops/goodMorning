By Rebecca R. Ruiz CHARLESTON, S.C. — Senator Lindsey Graham’s comments that Black people can succeed without limits in South Carolina if they are conservative and that young women can excel if they follow a “traditional family structure” have framed the final arguments of the costly Senate campaign here. Mr. Graham, a Republican seeking his fourth Senate term, has sped across South Carolina on a bus tour, imploring voters not to be tricked into abandoning him. Jaime Harrison, his Democratic opponent, has called the veteran senator a relic and is dominating the airwaves, powered by record-shattering fund-raising. To Mr. Harrison, Mr. Graham’s comments on Black South Carolinians and women encapsulate what he has framed as competing visions of the South, one that looks backward and another embracing a diverse, inclusive future. “I think he is a relic of 1950,” Mr. Harrison said of Mr. Graham, who has led the race by modest margins in some polls. The incumbent appeared to embrace the role in which Mr. Harrison had cast him, pledging to defend South Carolina’s status quo. “We’re not going to let our life and our way of life go away Tuesday, and that’s what’s on the ballot,” Mr. Graham told supporters at one of his weekend rallies, inspiring some in the crowd to raise campaign signs overhead, face masks dangling from some of their wrists. With control of the Senate at stake, every competitive Senate race has taken on heightened importance. Republicans now hold a three-seat Senate majority, but the party is expected to lose at least two of those seats, while the Democrats are anticipated to lose one. Democrats from across the country have flooded South Carolina with money, motivated by Mr. Graham’s staunch support of President Trump and his stewardship of Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s lightning-fast confirmation to the Supreme Court as Judiciary Committee chairman. But the same factors that have mobilized the nation’s Democrats to oppose Mr. Graham have been used by Mr. Graham to rally support in South Carolina, where Mr. Trump remains popular and Justice Barrett’s confirmation has been celebrated. The Senate candidates’ dueling visions for South Carolina mirrored their views on the state of the nation. Mr. Graham echoed the president’s broad assurances that the coronavirus would come under control without further lockdowns, hailing Mr. Trump’s first term as a success and encouraging people to “imagine four more years” of the president’s policies and judicial picks. Mr. Harrison and his allies invoked surging cases of the virus, struggling businesses, mounting unemployment, and what Representative James E. Clyburn, the dean of South Carolina’s Democrats, called the Trump administration’s commitment to “turning the clock back on the progress this nation has made.” Even as Mr. Graham aligned himself closely with the president in his final pitch to voters, he acknowledged that he had been among his most vocal critics during the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. “There’s a lot of drama, and some of it’s self-inflicted,” he said of Mr. Trump. “But when you back up, he’s done a great job for the conservative cause.” Mr. Graham and his allies have made his work on the Judiciary Committee central to his appeal for re-election, turning the names of the Supreme Court’s two newest members, Justices Barrett and Brett M. Kavanaugh, into their loudest battle cry. “Lindsey Graham, with the Supreme Court nominations, has shown himself to be a big leader. If we don’t get him back in, it’s going to be a serious problem,” said Mike Bales of Hanahan, S.C., who attended a rally with his wife Catherine and their young son. “Our freedoms and our way of life is at stake.” As Lin Bennett, a Republican state representative, warmed up the crowd before the senator stepped off the bus in Charleston, she made a similar pitch. “I know some of y’all have been disappointed with him, but he has done a great job — look at the judges that he’s putting on the courts,” Ms. Bennett said. Stumping for Mr. Harrison over the weekend, Mr. Clyburn said the Republican Senate had “aided and abetted” the president in neglecting the welfare of Americans because it had been “more preoccupied” with confirming judges as fast as possible. “They have been confirming them to lifetime appointments just because they can,” he said. “Rather than be concerned about everyday people’s lives, they are concerned about an ideology.” Mr. Harrison, a mentee of Mr. Clyburn’s who first reached out to the congressman when he was in high school, tried to keep the focus closer to home. “It’s so funny that he wants to make the judiciary an issue,” he said of Mr. Graham. “Why doesn’t he make getting the Charleston loophole bill an issue?” referring to gun-control legislation drafted to close a loophole that allowed a white supremacist with a criminal record to buy a handgun that he used to slaughter Black parishioners at Charleston’s storied Mother Emanuel A.M.E. Church in 2015. Pressed on Mr. Trump’s record of judicial appointments, Mr. Harrison did not say whether he would have supported the confirmations of Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Barrett. In a race in which a staggering amount of money has been spent, each camp’s 11th-hour pitch sought to paint the other as beholden to special interests: Mr. Harrison’s supporters waved “For Sale” signs with Mr. Graham’s name at a drive-in rally in North Charleston on Sunday; Mr. Graham called Mr. Harrison the favored candidate of “New York and California,” arguing that even if his opponent opposed defunding the police, some of his donors might not. Supporters at each man’s rallies said they were confident about their candidate’s chances. “South Carolina is red to the roots,” said Beverly Owensby, a past president of the South Carolina Federation of Republican Women, who said she had traveled to Washington to support Justice Barrett’s nomination this fall. Carlette Geddis, who attended one of Mr. Harrison’s events in Hollywood, S.C., said, “I feel, with Jaime, we have someone who can win this election and make a difference.” She was decked out in the colors of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the historically Black sorority to which Senator Kamala Harris also belonged. “He’s homegrown, just like Lindsey is, but I’m looking at the issues, and what Jaime’s talking about is what I like for my country.” Some Democrats expressed concern about a protracted vote-counting process or potential voter suppression in South Carolina, a state that requires government-issued photo identification to vote. Mr. Harrison said Sunday that his campaign had a team of lawyers standing by. “We know the tricks of the trade that the other side are going to try to do in order to save this race,” he said. Mr. Graham was just ready for the advertising blitz against him to end. “Don’t you miss car commercials?” he asked. “I can’t wait to see a car commercial.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
