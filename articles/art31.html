By Gail Collins and Bret Stephens Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every week. Bret Stephens: Gail, we both need to spend December recovering from the dramas and traumas of 2020, so this will be our last conversation until 2021. Looking back on the year so far, do you feel more optimistic, or less, than you did when it began? Gail Collins: Well gee, Bret. Any year in which we get rid of Donald Trump certainly can’t be all bad. It’s hard to get past the coronavirus pall, but I’m gonna pin my hopes on a vaccine program that brings things under control by the time warm weather returns. And the new administration is in full swing. How about you? Bret: In January I predicted that Trump would win re-election. I’ve never been so glad to be proved wrong. I also feel pretty good about the team Joe Biden is putting together. Janet Yellen isn’t going to blow up the economy. Antony Blinken isn’t going to blow up the free world. Alejandro Mayorkas isn’t going to put kids in cages. All this promises to make 2021 better than 2020 purely by default. Gail: Default works for me. Bret: On the other hand, there’s a lot that worries me, too. The fact that so many rank-and-file Republicans refuse to accept that Trump lost fair-and-square is a very bad sign about the sanity — or lack thereof — of the party. The possibility that Trump is going to skip the inauguration so that he can announce his next run for president is another bad sign for and about the party’s future. Together, they augur for the QAnonization of the G.O.P., which is just awful news for a democracy with a two-party system. Gail: You know, I was just talking with a friend about the olden days when Republicans were all about balancing the budget and the popular banner of anti-Communism. (Back then, anybody who wanted to raise taxes could get a “commie” categorization just for proposing the idea.) The Democrats were divided between the old New Deal standard-bearers and younger folks who mostly rallied around the civil rights and antiwar movements. But the big heroes in Washington were still senators who could make bipartisan deals and keep things moving. Then the social right wing — particularly the anti-abortion forces — came up to the front. And the big money people realized they lost nothing financial by making an alliance. Everything is about taking a stand and nothing is about getting stuff done. Bret: Maybe my biggest worry, though, is that we’re living in a country where the Dow just hit 30,000 at the same time that people are waiting in line for hours at food banks. That’s a recipe for potentially catastrophic social friction. Gail: Couldn’t agree more. How about a great new White House agenda focused on raising taxes on the rich and redistributing the money to the poor? I believe I remember hearing someone talk about that — Joe Somebody?
