By Elaine Glusac The pandemic has decimated urban tourism as Americans, if they choose to travel, have fled populated areas to spread out in rural and wilderness destinations where social distancing comes easier. With business travel all but stopped, city hotels and tourist organizations have made a full-court press to attract especially locals and nearby leisure travelers with bottom-barrel rates and extra perks. Such campaigns to coax visitors within driving distances have shown signs of success. In downtown Los Angeles, the Hotel Figueroa reported nearly 80 percent occupancy on a recent weekend, largely in response to its deal extending 26 percent off to California residents. In Austin, Texas, the Fairmont Austin has been filling to 70 percent on some weekends with a “Texas Strong” offer from $150 a night including parking and a $25 credit. Since July, about three quarters of the weekend guests at the Pendry San Diego, where rates start at $295, have come from within a 300-mile radius. A staycation — specifically one where you stay in a hotel rather than at home — may be convenient, but nowadays it’s hardly spontaneous. More so than ever before, you’ll need to schedule key staycation activities; with capacities limited, most museums, tours and restaurants require advance reservations. If you live near one of the following six cities and have decided against traveling farther afield, here are some tips on how to be a local tourist. You’ll save some money — and maybe your town’s tourism industry — in the process. PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS The city currently limits indoor dining to 40 percent occupancy; however, due to a surge in local infections, it will ban indoor dining and limit gatherings to 25 people beginning Oct. 30. Bars  may operate outdoors only. Dining and bar tables are limited to six people. In hotels, daily housekeeping is available on request. Face coverings are required in indoor and outdoor public settings.
