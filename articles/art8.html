By H. Samy Alim and Geneva Smitherman Dr. Alim and Dr. Smitherman are the authors of “Articulate While Black: Barack Obama, Language, and Race in the U.S.” After Joe Biden announced that he had selected Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, Bernie Sanders praised her in an interview on MSNBC: “I will tell you that Kamala is very smart, very aggressive,” he said. And then he delivered the inevitable, racialized compliment that makes many African-Americans cringe: “very articulate.” Just a few days earlier, on MSNBC, Steve Schmidt, the former Republican strategist, called Ms. Harris is “a formidable political leader in this country,” adding: “She’s smart. She’s quick on her feet. She’s articulate.” With this description, both men echoed Todd Gloria, a candidate for San Diego mayor, who said in an interview with News 8 on Aug. 11, “She is someone who is incredibly smart, very articulate.” Bob Mulholland, a Democratic superdelegate from California, declared outside of his home on the same day, “In the era of social media, you got to have someone who looks good on television and is articulate and intelligent, and that fits Kamala Harris.” Writing in The Week in December, Damon Linker called her “the total package. Smart, articulate, sassy, attractive.” This year has started to feel a lot like 2007, when Joe Biden apologized to Barack Obama after public criticism for calling him “the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.” To paraphrase the question that we asked in our book, “Articulate While Black”: Why do non-Black people so frequently refer to high-achieving Black people as “articulate,” and why is it so offensive? As Lynette Clemetson explained in February 2007 in a New York Times essay about the way the adjective was used to praise Mr. Obama, “When whites use the word in reference to blacks, it often carries a subtext of amazement, even bewilderment.” That subtext is inherently offensive, she wrote, “because it suggests that the recipient of the ‘compliment’ is notably different from other Black people.” Michael Eric Dyson, a professor of sociology at Georgetown, told Ms. Clemetson that the implication “is that most Black people do not have the capacity to engage in articulate speech, when white people are automatically assumed to be articulate.” Describing a Black person as “articulate” can be an example of what Imani Perry, a professor of African-American studies at Princeton, describes in her book “More Beautiful and More Terrible: The Embrace and Transcendence of Racial Inequality in the United States” as placing the person into “a state of exception.” This happens, she argues, only when the “normal” state of the person’s group is assumed to be deficient. This is of course not what most Americans think of as your standard, run-of-the-mill racism, the kind that has plagued the history of this country since its inception, leading to genocide, enslavement, mass incarceration and police abuse.
