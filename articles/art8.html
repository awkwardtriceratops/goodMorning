Biden Jr. by four points in the latest Times/Siena survey of North Carolina, and Senator Thom Tillis is lagging behind his Democratic challenger in a crucial Senate race. By Reid J. Epstein and Matt Stevens With a half-million votes already cast, President Trump and Senator Thom Tillis trail their Democratic challengers in North Carolina, according to a new poll from The New York Times and Siena College, signaling potential trouble for Republicans in a state critical to both the presidential race and the battle for control of the Senate. Joe Biden leads Donald Trump in North Carolina, a state Mr. Trump won in 2016. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of 627 likely voters in North Carolina from Oct. 9 to Oct.13. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. leads Mr. Trump among likely voters, 46 percent to 42 percent, while Mr. Tillis is behind Cal Cunningham, his Democratic challenger who is embroiled in a scandal over flirtatious text messages, 41 percent to 37 percent. Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, leads his Republican challenger, Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, by a larger margin: 51 percent to 37 percent. Mr. Cunningham’s lead has held steady since early September, when the Times/Siena poll found the Democrat with a five-point advantage over Mr. Tillis. Fifteen percent of likely voters surveyed said they remained undecided in the Senate race — nearly twice as many as those who said they were undecided in the presidential contest in North Carolina. The survey has a margin of sampling error of 4.5 percentage points. The poll was conducted within the last few days, well after Mr. Cunningham offered an awkward public apology for the romantic (but PG-rated) texts he sent this summer to a woman who is not his wife. It found that Mr. Cunningham, a former state senator and an Iraq war veteran, retains a 15-point advantage among women. A Democratic challenger leads an incumbent Republican in North Carolina for a seat that could determine which party controls the Senate. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of 627 likely voters in North Carolina from Oct. 9 to Oct. 13. North Carolina has long been crucial to both parties’ hopes of winning a Senate majority. Democrats are counting on Mr. Cunningham to be one of at least four challengers the party needs to win Republican-held seats to take control of the chamber, while Republicans seeking to hold on to their majority will have a far easier time doing so if Mr. Tillis is re-elected. Mr. Cunningham has seen his own personal approval rating sink since his texting scandal emerged. Last month 46 percent of likely voters polled in North Carolina had a favorable view of Mr. Cunningham, compared to 29 percent who saw him unfavorably. Now 40 percent of likely voters have a favorable view and 41 percent see him unfavorably. Vasiliki Kalkani, 52, of Asheville, N.C., voted for Jill Stein of the Green Party for president in 2016 but now backs Mr. Biden because she said it is “critical” to remove Mr. Trump from office. Ms. Kalkani, a small-business owner, said she did not care about Mr. Cunningham’s text messages. “Who doesn’t have sex scandals?” she said. “Do they take care of the country?” In 2016, Mr. Trump carried North Carolina by 3.7 percentage points over Hillary Clinton, while Senator Richard Burr, a Republican, won re-election by nearly six points. Mr. Biden’s standing in North Carolina is consistent with the leads he has built in other battleground states. The former vice president has significant advantages among women and suburbanites, and is far more trusted to deal with the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus.
