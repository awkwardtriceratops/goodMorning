By Jacey Fortin A Salt Lake City police officer shot a 13-year-old boy with autism on Friday night, prompting an investigation and raising concerns about officers’ use of force in a city that has been reckoning with protests and police accountability. The officer fired at the boy while responding to a call about a “violent psych issue,” Sgt. Keith Horrocks of the Salt Lake City Police Department told reporters on Saturday morning. “In this case it was a juvenile that was having a mental episode, a psychological episode, and had made threats to some folks with a weapon,” Sergeant Horrocks said, adding that the officer had fired his gun “during a short foot pursuit.”
