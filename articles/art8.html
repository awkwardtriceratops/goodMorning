Children Are Frightening Year-Round.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Why little kids have a special ability to creep out their parents. By Christina Caron Some parents don’t need spooky stories or horror movies. The real terror already lives within the walls of their homes. To be clear, I’m talking about little children. Kids can be incredibly eerie. They seem innocent but sometimes appear highly sophisticated. And when they communicate, it’s often in such a simple, uninhibited way that many adults find it unnerving. Especially when their children are talking about something unpleasant. Harper, 6, has mastered the art of delivering grim news in a calm, matter-of-fact way, kind of like a newscaster announcing that the stock market just crashed. “I wouldn’t sleep in your bedroom if I were you,” she once advised her parents. She and her family live in a creaky, century-old white stucco home in Abingdon, Va., which has been in her dad’s family for generations. Shortly after they moved in, she told her parents about the “skeleton men” who inhabit the house and sometimes the yard, too. They’re dressed like soldiers, and one wears body armor, but she isn’t scared of them. They’re more of an annoyance. “She’ll roll her eyes, shrug her shoulders and say, ‘Ugh, one of them walked through the wall again,’” said Harper’s mother, Alysia Hoover-Thompson, 40, who is a psychologist. Harper much prefers her “attic friend,” a nice ghost named Felicia. This is not the first time Harper has spooked her parents. When she was 2, she declared, “You’re not my real Mom and Dad. My first Mom and Dad died. You’re my second set of parents.” “I would say she probably brought it up 25 or 30 times over the years,” Hoover-Thompson said, adding that Harper no longer recalls saying that. These stories might seem unsettling, but developmental psychologists say that it’s normal for children to talk about death or express their aggression during imaginary play. “It’s a natural part of childhood,” said Sandra Russ, a psychology professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, who has studied how children play for three decades. “It’s healthy to have a vivid imagination.” And yes, she added, most children know it’s all pretend by the time they are 3. “It’s a way of them expressing their fears,” Dr. Russ said. “Adults talk it out; children play it out.” And when the things they imagine start to feel too scary, she added, they can stop or adjust the story line. “They’re in control of what happens.” It’s the adults, the ones who are used to being in control, who might suddenly feel unmoored. Or at least that’s how Ashley Fuller, 33, felt when she emerged from the bathroom to find her son Calvin, who was 3 at the time, standing in the darkness of her bedroom, naked, holding a red, inflated balloon. He roared and lunged at her. Now she laughs about it — nervously — but at the time, she said, “I screamed so loud. You just don’t expect anything like that.” Later that year he started asking about death. It often happened while they were driving home from preschool in their Dallas neighborhood, where he loved to go bird-watching. “I don’t see any birds. They must have all died,” he commented one day. Or: “The birds look sad, I think it’s because all their parents died.” And then: “When am I going to die?” Fuller and her husband took Calvin to a child psychologist, who assured them that all was well. Right around this time, his great-grandmother had died, and so had a relative’s dog. Asking these questions was simply his way of making sense of what happened, though it was unusual for a child his age to ask about his own mortality, his parents were told.
