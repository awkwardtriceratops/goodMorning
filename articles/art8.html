By Sydney Franklin The core benefits of co-living took a big hit when the coronavirus struck New York City. Instagram-friendly common rooms and co-working spaces sat empty last spring as residents complied with strict lockdown orders. Postage-stamp bedrooms became constant quarters. Tenants who had become accustomed to regular cleaning services suddenly had to disinfect on their own. When New Yorkers fled the city in the early months of the pandemic, co-living companies — like many other rental companies — lost tenants and income. Their model, which includes perks like helping residents find roommates and providing fully furnished units, was no match for the virus. Co-living buildings have generally charged more than traditional rental buildings, in exchange for shared amenities and a dormlike atmosphere that provides instant community — an environment deeply challenged by the rules of coronavirus lockdown. After the initial shock, most co-living companies coalesced around a few strategies to woo residents back. They offered rent concessions, promoted flexible lease lengths to tenants who didn’t know how long they would be able to stay in New York, and provided a smooth and easy move-in process. Now, eight months into the pandemic, co-living companies say demand is growing again, and a few are even restarting ambitious expansions they had put on hold when the virus first hit. Several co-living companies initially responded to the pandemic with an effort to attract medical professionals who were coming to the city to serve Covid-19 patients. Outpost Club, which oversees 350 bedrooms across 20 buildings in New York, offered medical workers discounted housing with no deposit and flexible cancellation terms. Common, a national co-living company, and the Collective, a London-based company that transformed a former hotel in Long Island City into a co-living space, made similar offers. By the time many medical workers left in July as infection rates leveled off, several co-living companies were offering rent deals to attract traditional tenants. Specials included rent reductions in the range of 30 to 35 percent, sometimes in the form of one or two months rent-free. Outpost Club’s chief executive, Sergii Starostin, said he saw students respond to his company’s rent deals first, and professionals followed. The company lost 120 tenants across their New York properties by the height of the pandemic in April, going from 300 people in January down to 180. Numbers started rising in June, but only until September, when Outpost Club signed 60 new leases, did the company regain the leases lost earlier this year. Now, they house a total of 323 tenants in the city. In October, they received 15 requests from landlords interested in working with them to convert traditional apartments into co-living spaces, a big jump from just two in October of last year. “Flexibility is now the number one thing that tenants want to have,” Mr. Starostin said. “Every second person is asking about it.” About half of Outpost Club’s newly signed leases in a given month are now one-to-three month commitments with a month-to-month option that follows. Before May, just five percent of tenants requested month-to-month options. Quarters, a global co-living network with four buildings in New York, made similar concessions to get similar results. The number of tenants in their buildings declined to roughly 70 percent in the second and third quarters of 2020, but the company hopes to see it increase to over 90 percent by January. New York’s case mirrors a national trend. Susan Tjarksen, who studies multifamily capital markets at the real estate analytics firm Cushman & Wakefield, said that occupancy rates at co-living properties hit a pandemic-low in June at 86 percent and rose steadily through the summer. As of October, rates are now in the low 90th percentile. Jorge Hurtado-Burgos, a 21-year-old student and bank client services representative, saw promise in co-living in the midst of the pandemic. In August, he was looking for an easy transition into an apartment after a summer of couch surfing. He chose a four-bedroom shared unit in an East Village apartment managed by Bungalow, a San Francisco-based co-living company that works with landlords to fill, furnish and oversee their investment properties. Unlike some co-living brands in New York, Bungalow doesn’t own any of the apartments or buildings it outfits. Instead it currently partners with 47 landlords to rent a total of 430 rooms. The company offered to waive Mr. Hurtado-Burgos’s application fee and he moved in within a week of finding the space. “It was very straight to the point and easy,” Mr. Hurtado-Burgos said. He signed a six-month lease agreement at $1,430 a month, which includes utilities and cleaning fees, but plans to extend his stay through next summer. In another Bungalow building in Williamsburg, Nick Nevins, 26, a digital marketing manager, signed a 16-month lease in September, since some co-living companies offer reduced rents for longer lease agreements. On a 12-month lease, Mr. Nevins would have paid $1,515, not including utilities, for his en-suite room in a seven-bedroom apartment. Instead, he pays $1,485 a month plus an additional $150 for utilities and cleaning. “It’s definitely the easiest move-in experience I’ve ever had,” he said, since the apartment came furnished and he only had to bring his own bedroom furniture. Mr. Nevins also looked at other apartment listings in Brooklyn, as well as two other Bungalow buildings. He was drawn to the rent-by-room model because he wouldn’t be responsible for replacing roommates.
