Officials said Beijing had not decided whether to wade more directly in the American presidential race. By Adam Goldman, Sheera Frenkel and Julian E. Barnes WASHINGTON — Facebook has detected limited Chinese operations intended to both help and hurt President Trump’s re-election chances, the company announced on Tuesday, the first public disclosure of Chinese efforts to influence the presidential election in November. The Chinese activity, while modest and not directly attributed to the government in Beijing, could undercut Mr. Trump’s repeated contention that China is intervening in the election to support former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic candidate. While the intelligence community has assessed that China opposes Mr. Trump’s re-election, officials said this week that the actions on Facebook so far were small and Beijing had not yet decided to mount a large-scale influence operation comparable to Russian efforts in 2016 and this year. Facebook identified a range of fake accounts pushing information about American and Philippine politics and Chinese activity in the South China Sea. Though much of the activity outlined by China was centered on the Philippines, some was more directly relevant to American politics. Facebook said it was removing the accounts for violating its policy against “inauthentic behavior.” The activity was coordinated and originated in China, though Chinese officials, including the ambassador to the United States, have denied allegations they are seeking to influence the vote in November. Facebook security first detected the new activity and shared the information with U.S. government officials. American technology companies as well as intelligence agencies have shown more willingness this year to release information about foreign influence operations, having been criticized by lawmakers for being too cautious in 2016. While the Chinese-created network gained more than 133,000 followers, Facebook said it had received little attention in the United States, with fewer than 3,000 U.S.-based accounts following it. The group posted information both for and against Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden. “They were focused on driving division,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, the head of security at Facebook. “The engagement with the U.S. was both nascent and limited. It was both supportive and critical of the major political candidates in the U.S.” Facebook does not release the number of page views, or impressions, that various posts receive. However, based on how the site works, users would have been unlikely to see a post unless they followed the Chinese group or its pages. Mr. Gleicher said that Facebook had detected no other Chinese activity on its platform. “With the U.S., the goal appeared to be audience-building,” said Ben Nimmo, whose firm, Graphika, worked with Facebook to release a report about the Chinese campaign. Mr. Nimmo said they had named the new Chinese operation Naval Gazing because of its largely maritime focus. The group became active in late 2016, first posting about Chinese military activity, according to Graphika’s report. In 2018, the campaign broadened its topics to the South China Sea, posting details about U.S. ship movements and Chinese military achievements. In recent years, the U.S. Navy has conducted so-called freedom of navigation operations, devised to challenge China’s territorial claims over its artificial islands.
