Blow Opinion Columnist Saturday, I buried my brother in a segregated cemetery. (More on that later.) He was my oldest brother, Frederick Edward Blow, just 58, and he had battled the autoimmune disease sarcoidosis for nearly two decades. Most people never knew just how ill he was. He hid it well behind a larger-than-life personality. But, in the end, his body was too weakened and too damaged to fight off the final wave of infections. I got a panicked voice mail from my mother the Friday before he died. “Charles. It’s critical, it’s critical. Call me back,” her trembling voice mustered through audible sobs. When I called back, she said that she was in the hospital with my brother and that “we already lost him once.” “What?!,” I asked. “He died, but they shocked him back to life,” she said. He was now breathing on a ventilator. I asked my mother for the prognosis. She said that she didn’t ask many questions because she didn’t want to know the answers. I was shocked. I had texted my brother a few weeks earlier about his recent round of illness, “How are you doing big bro?” He replied simply, “Better, thanks.” I thought he was on the mend. In fact, he was spiraling toward his expiration. I booked a flight immediately for the next day, early in the morning. The doctors said he wouldn’t make it through the night. He did, but only because of the ventilator. I hoped to get there before he died. I failed. They took him off the ventilator 15 minutes before I arrived at the hospital. My family mournfully stalked around the hospital parking lot. Because of Covid-19 rules, only two people could be in the hospital with him at a time. Those spots were filled by two of his sons. But even they left when they took him off the ventilator. They couldn’t bear to see him die. My eyes zeroed in on my mother, sitting alone on a stone bench in front of the hospital door, shoulders slumped. I went to her and gave her a muscular hug, tight enough to convey my grief, and her body loosened and released and she sobbed in my arms. A week later, I sat with family at a graveside, in that segregated cemetery, waiting for my brother’s coffin to be sealed in his crypt. If you ask locals, it is not a segregated cemetery, but two separate cemeteries — one white, one Black — that just happen to be separated by a chain-link fence. But, of course, the two cemetery associations could easily remove the fence and commit to joint maintenance of both, which basically amounts to cutting the grass and collecting fees. But that has never happened. The fence remains so that, as I have written before, “no one, living or dead, should forget the rules.” My brother’s burial begins the fourth generation of our family in that cemetery, and now I know where my grave is supposed to be. I now have to decide whether I will allow myself to be buried in a segregated cemetery to be close to my family, or if I will be buried somewhere else on principle. That the issue of race stalks us to the grave is but one of the life lessons my brother’s death brought to the fore. Here are some others. The importance of family and community. All my life, when someone died in our community, my mother would make the pilgrimage to the family home, bearing some small token of condolence and comfort: a pie or cake, some sodas, a small amount of money. I had no idea what it was like to be on the receiving side of that until my brother died. The community will not allow you to grieve in solitude. They are there, encircling you, holding you, lifting you. Everyone brings something. Many sit and talk for a bit, some sharing a laugh, some shedding a tear. Your sorrow is shared sorrow; the weight on your shoulders is shared by many. My mother didn’t have to cook or clean for a week. There were hands everywhere doing everything that needed to be done. The importance of end-of-life planning.
