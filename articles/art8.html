By David M. Halbfinger and Adam Rasgon JERUSALEM — An Israeli police officer who gunned down a Palestinian man who had autism in the Old City of Jerusalem in May defied an order to hold his fire even though the man posed no danger to anyone, his commander has told investigators, according to people briefed on the case. “He didn’t attack or do anything,” the commander testified, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. “He was definitely not resisting.” The May 30 fatal shooting of Iyad al-Hallaq, 30, who was on his way to a school for the disabled, came five days after the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, and quickly became a rallying cry against police brutality at political protests that have roiled Israel for much of the summer. Mr. al-Hallaq was about 150 yards from the entrance to his school at around 6 a.m. on a Saturday when police officers called to him as he entered the Old City through the Lions Gate. Rather than stop, he ran along the Via Dolorosa. When the initial officers reported a potential “terrorist,” several others gave chase. One of them, a 21-year-old commander who was just days away from leaving the force, told investigators he fired at Mr. al-Hallaq’s lower body while racing after him, but missed. Seeking cover, Mr. al-Hallaq turned into the gate of a fenced-in area used by sanitation workers where, according to witnesses, he cowered against a wall as two Border Police officers cornered him: the 21-year-old and his 19-year-old partner, a rookie a few weeks out of basic training. Their names have not been made public. Both were performing their compulsory military service in the Border Police, a paramilitary arm of the Israeli police that operates on the West Bank, in parts of Jerusalem and in other volatile settings and is frequently called upon in situations with the potential to escalate into violence. Witnesses have said that a teacher of Mr. al-Hallaq’s saw the episode unfolding and tried to intervene, shouting at the officers that Mr. al-Hallaq was disabled and posed no threat. But the commander’s testimony, as reported by Haaretz, suggests that, disabled or not, Mr. al-Hallaq should not have been shot. Haaretz said it had obtained portions of both officers’ testimony to investigators at the Justice Ministry’s police-misconduct unit, which staged a re-enactment at the scene late Wednesday night. In Haaretz’s account, whose accuracy was confirmed by people briefed on the case, the older officer, having chased Mr. al-Hallaq down, instantly grasped that “there was a discrepancy between the reports I got at the beginning — that this was a terrorist incident, that it was something intended to harm innocent people — and the situation in the trash room.”
