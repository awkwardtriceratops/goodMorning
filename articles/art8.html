By Jill Cowan Good morning. If there’s one thing California’s electorate can teach us, it’s that — even in a deep blue state like ours — it’s unwise to make generalizations about voters from any community. Exhibit A: Latinos. My colleague Jennifer Medina has spent much of the past year talking to and writing about many of the 32 million eligible Latino voters across the country. Most recently, she explored why Hispanic evangelical voters have found themselves politically homeless and how, for some Latino men, the president has a macho appeal. (She also hosted this episode of The Daily about Arizona’s divided Latino vote.) I asked Jenny more about what she’s learned: What do you see as the most persistent misconceptions about Latino voters? First, and this can’t be overstated: Let’s get rid of the notion of the sleeping giant. What this cycle has made clear is that Latinos are very eager to engage with campaigns that are ready to engage with them. We saw this with the Sanders campaign during the primary, especially in California and Nevada, where Latinos helped fuel his victory. But we are also seeing evidence of that with the Trump campaign — more on that in a second. The Biden campaign has received a lot of criticism for not doing enough early enough to reach out to Latino voters, though it is now trying to make up for any lost ground. The conventional wisdom in Democratic circles for years has been that nothing will unite Latinos like Donald Trump, with his rhetoric demonizing immigrants and policies designed to keep new migrants from entering the country. But that gets at two faulty assumptions: First, though immigration is a key issue for many Latino voters, polls suggest it is not the top issue for a majority of them. Latino voters often rank education and the economy as even more pressing — and now the pandemic often tops the list. And, second, back to Trump: The Trump campaign has put considerable effort into reaching out to Latinos, particularly in South Florida, but also in Nevada, Arizona, and yes, in California. Polls consistently show that roughly 25 to 30 percent of Latino voters say they plan to vote for the president. [R.S.V.P. for a discussion, featuring Jorge Ramos, anchor of Noticiero Univisión and a contributing Opinion writer to The Times, about the power of the Latino vote.] Latinos are not a monolith, obviously. That being said, are there large-scale shifts taking place in the Latino electorate that cut across geography? How do Latino voters in California fit into that picture? The pandemic has, of course, changed everything. I have seen public and private polling suggesting that Latinos are even more likely than white voters to see that as the top issue now. Coronavirus infections and deaths have disproportionately hit Latinos all over the country, including in California. And so has the economic crisis. For months, Mr. Trump boasted about historically low unemployment rates among Latinos, but now so many people have lost jobs or seen their wages reduced. At the same time, many experts project record turnout among Latinos, with the same kind of surge in voting we saw during the 2018 midterms. And this year, for the first time, Latinos are projected to be the largest nonwhite voting bloc.
