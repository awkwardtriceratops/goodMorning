Rewrites Trump’s Racism — and America’s<br></h1><p id="artcont">The Black speakers have a job to do: erase history and cloud reality. By Charles M. Blow Opinion Columnist So far the Republican National Convention isn’t so much presenting a record of America and an administration as it is inventing one. The speakers at the event haven’t admitted to the pathological pursuit of a white nationalist, white power agenda that has become a signature of Donald Trump’s presidency. So what we’ve heard bears little relation to the fullness of truth and is not the correct distillation of a record. Instead, we have been feted to a parade of Black and brown faces that have sought to soften or even erase Trump’s overt history of racism to falsify an American story into one in which liberals are worse racial offenders than conservatives. In this inside-out world, Trump has been an exemplar on racial inclusion and his defeat would usher in an era of racial division. This is the Rip Van Winkle approach to campaigning: Just pretend that people were asleep the entire time you called Mexicans rapists, said Islam hates us, called Haiti and African nations shithole countries, separated migrant children from their parents and locked them in cages, tried to deport the Dreamers and attacked Black Lives Matter. That is exactly what happened, particularly on the first day of the convention. Former football player Herschel Walker, a Black man, said: “It hurt my soul to hear the terrible names that people call Donald. The worst one is racist. I take it out as a personal insult that people would think I’ve had a 37-year friendship with a racist.” Walker’s personal relationship with Trump is meaningless here. The personal doesn’t negate the pattern. History is full of racist white people, white supremacists, even enslavers, who developed friendships with Black people.
