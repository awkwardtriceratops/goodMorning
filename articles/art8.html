Experts Say That’s Illegal.<br></h1><p id="artcont">It’s a small but telling detail in The Times’s exposé on the president’s taxes. By James B. Stewart There were many bombshells in The New York Times’s exposé last week about President Trump’s taxes. He has paid basically zero federal income tax for years. His much-ballyhooed businesses are on the ropes. And that was just the headline. But it was a juicy and seemingly less significant matter that jumped out at me: Mr. Trump spent more than $70,000 on hairstyling during several years of his run on “The Apprentice,” his reality-TV show. That, of course, is quite a lot for any one person to spend on having his hair cut, blow-dried or colored. But what is really remarkable about the revelation is that Mr. Trump’s production company deducted his hairstyling expenses from its taxable income, reducing its tax bill. Tax experts told me that deducting what is ordinarily considered a personal expense is prohibited under almost any circumstances. And they said such a deduction could potentially constitute criminal tax fraud if the cost of the hairstyling was reimbursed by someone else. Three former NBC executives involved in “The Apprentice” told me that, while they didn’t recall the exact terms of Mr. Trump’s contract, they were very familiar with the way such contracts are typically written. The cost of hair and makeup for a star of Mr. Trump’s stature would generally be covered by the show, and Mr. Trump would have been reimbursed for any of the costs he incurred. “I can’t think of any circumstances in which Trump would have paid those costs out of his own pocket and not be reimbursed,” one of those officials said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he still does business with NBC and Mark Burnett, the producer of “The Apprentice,” who has also produced “The Voice” for NBC. Taxpayers are not allowed to deduct reimbursed business expenses. “That would be a crime if it’s intentional,” said Schuyler M. Moore, a tax expert at the law firm Greenberg Glusker in Los Angeles and the author of the legal treatise “Taxation of the Entertainment Industry.” In any case, courts have ruled that hairstyling, even for someone on a TV program, is a personal expense that cannot be deducted. (There is no statute of limitations for civil tax fraud. Ordinarily the Internal Revenue Service has three years from the date of a tax filing to begin an audit that can result in criminal charges.) The White House referred questions to the Trump Organization. Alan Garten, the chief legal officer there, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Mr. Trump has always been secretive about the swirling, straw-colored confection that rests atop his scalp. His flamboyant hairdo became as much a part of his “Apprentice” trademark as “You’re fired!” and has carried over into the White House. “The Apprentice,” like every other network reality show, had its own hair and makeup stylists to tend to Mr. Trump and the show’s contestants. But they didn’t cut Mr. Trump’s hair and were wary of even touching a flyaway strand without his explicit permission. One of the show’s stylists, Amy Lasch, told The New York Post in 2016 that Mr. Trump arrived on the set fully coifed. “It’s as if he got ready somewhere else first,” she said. It is common for major stars to have their own hair and makeup experts. Often the show pays those stylists directly, but sometimes the star pays and is reimbursed by the show. One reason for such arrangements is that the on-air talent uses nonunion stylists who can’t be paid directly by the show.
