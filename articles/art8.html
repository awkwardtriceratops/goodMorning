The streets turned deadly after his call to arms. By Neil MacFarquhar Tapping on his cellphone with a sense of purpose, Kevin Mathewson, a former wedding photographer and onetime city alderman in Kenosha, Wis., did not slow down to fix his typos as he dashed off an online appeal to his neighbors. It was time, he wrote on Facebook in late August, to “take up arms to defend out City tonight from the evil thugs.” One day earlier, hundreds of residents had poured onto the streets of Kenosha to protest the police shooting of 29-year-old Jacob Blake. Disturbed by the sight of buildings in flames when he drove downtown, Mr. Mathewson decided it was time for people to arm themselves to protect their houses and businesses. To his surprise, some 4,000 people responded on Facebook. Within minutes, the Kenosha Guard had sprung to life. His call to arms — along with similar calls from others inside and outside the state — propelled civilians bearing military-style rifles onto the streets, where late that night a gunman scuffling with protesters shot three of them, two fatally. The Kenosha Guard then evaporated just as quickly as it arose. Long a divisive figure in Kenosha, Mr. Mathewson, 36, who sprinkles his sentences with “Jeez!” and describes himself as “chunky,” does not fit the typical profile of a rifle-toting watchdog, although he said he supported President Trump on Second Amendment grounds. The rise and fall of his Kenosha Guard reflects the current spirit of vigilantism surfacing across the country. Organizations that openly display weapons have existed for decades, with certain hot-button issues like immigration or Second Amendment rights inspiring people who think the Constitution is under threat. Anti-immigrant and Islamophobic sentiments are rife, and some militant groups, like the Oath Keepers or the Three Percenters, train together under established hierarchies. Ever since the 2017 white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Va., armed groups have become fixtures at demonstrations around the country, although membership numbers remain opaque. With the approaching election ratcheting up tensions in recent months, armed groups that assembled via a few clicks on the keyboard have become both more visible and more widespread. Some especially violent groups were rooted in longstanding anti-government extremism, like the 14 men charged with various crimes in Michigan this month. They included six accused by the F.B.I. of plotting to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, whom the suspects had labeled a “tyrant” — framing their grievances in the vocabulary of the American Revolution. Starting in April, demonstrations against coronavirus lockdowns prompted makeshift vigilante groups to move offline and into the real world. That trickle become a torrent amid the nationwide protests after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis — with some armed groups claiming to protect the protesters while others sought to check them. “They just spawn out of nowhere,” said J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. When President Trump was asked at last month’s presidential debate about activity by right-wing extremists, including the violence in Kenosha, he declined to outright condemn such groups. His response — telling one far-right group to “stand back and stand by” — left experts who had already warned about the potential for greater violence before the Nov. 3 election bracing for even more. Experts who study violent groups say that many are technically not militias — they are too unstructured and do not undertake basic steps like training together. They are usually just a fraternity with a shared goal, like the groups in Oregon that patrolled back roads amid wildfires, hunting mostly imagined looters or arsonists. In Kenosha, police officers were caught on video expressing appreciation to the gunmen and handing them bottles of water, prompting criticism that law enforcement officers encouraged the armed groups. But soon after, the sheriff tried to distance his department. “Part of the problem with this group is they create confrontation,” David Beth, the Kenosha County sheriff, told reporters at a news conference. Asked later about any investigation, the Sheriff’s Department said it had not referred any cases linked to the Kenosha Guard for prosecution, and the Police Department did not respond. The Second Amendment may mention a “well regulated militia” but all 50 states ban private paramilitary groups, said Mary McCord, a former senior Justice Department official now at Georgetown University Law Center. Some groups avoid calling themselves “militias” to circumvent the prohibition, experts said. Mr. Mathewson first tried to muster the Kenosha Guard in June after the city had small protests because of Mr. Floyd’s death in Minnesota. A little more than 60 people responded. Then, on Aug. 23, video emerged that showed a Kenosha police officer firing seven times toward Mr. Blake’s back.
