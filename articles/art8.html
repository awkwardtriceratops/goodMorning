Finally I Know How to Help.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Nothing says Peak 2020 like donating antibodies while watching someone get married on your phone. By Margaret Renkl Contributing Opinion Writer NASHVILLE — I got sick in February on a trip to New York. Every time I stepped into an elevator, someone was coughing. On my last day in town, I found myself out of breath walking up a small hill, though I walk on hilly trails nearly every day. At home that night, I went straight to bed. I thought I was just tired. The next morning, I woke to every symptom of Covid-19 I’d read about, plus some that hadn’t been reported yet: fever, headache, chills, cough, sore throat, body aches, nausea. At the walk-in clinic, my flu test was negative. I was sick in bed for two weeks. Even after the fever finally broke, I was too weak to do much of anything. I’d take a shower and break out in a sweat as soon as I tried to step out of the tub. I coughed and coughed, and still it felt like an SUV was parked in my lungs. My primary care doctor ordered a chest X-ray, which showed pneumonia — a mild case, luckily. It was so early in the pandemic that Covid-19 tests were administered sparingly, and I didn’t meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s criteria for testing. “I think it’s reasonable to assume this is Covid-19,” my doctor said. “We just can’t prove it.” During the next few months, proving it became something of an obsession for me. At a time when so much was frightening and unpredictable, I just wanted to know one thing for sure. In April I volunteered for a study by the National Institutes of Health to determine the scope of the epidemic by testing for antibodies in people, like me, who believed they’d had an unconfirmed case of Covid-19. More than 400,000 people volunteered for 10,000 spots. I wasn’t accepted. Undaunted, I volunteered for a different antibody study — this one at Vanderbilt University Medical Center here in Nashville. In late August I was called in for a blood test to determine whether I carried Covid-19 antibodies in my blood and, if so, whether my antibody level was high enough to be potentially helpful to patients who might be treated with my plasma. Would I still have antibodies in my blood six months after I got sick? By the time I was accepted into Vanderbilt’s convalescent plasma study, that question meant something very different to me than it had in the beginning. I was long past looking for proof that the “flu” I’d had in February was Covid-19. More than 150,000 Americans had already died by August. When I got the email telling me that my antibody test was positive and well within the range needed for this study, it felt like a gift to be offered a way to help save others. Convalescent plasma is a treatment in which antibody-rich plasma from the blood of a Covid-19 survivor is given to a patient with an active infection as a way of inducing passive immunity. This is not the monoclonal treatment President Trump received when he was sick — those antibodies were tested using cells derived from fetal tissue. Convalescent plasma is the treatment the president was referring to back in August when he erroneously pronounced plasma “a cure.” To be clear, convalescent plasma is not a cure; at the moment, there is no cure for Covid-19. But treating sick people with the plasma of others who have recovered has been practiced successfully since the early 20th century, and a trial started by the Mayo Clinic last spring suggests that it might be beneficial in some severely ill Covid-19 patients. But without placebo-controlled research, it’s difficult to know what truly works, which patients it works for, under which specific conditions it works for them, or what level of donor antibodies is necessary to induce that response. Enter Dolly Parton. The reason researchers at Vanderbilt can conduct a convalescent plasma study — and other studies — is that back in April Dolly Parton gave Vanderbilt $1 million for Covid-19 research. Nobody in Tennessee would find this news amazing: Ms. Parton is famous for her philanthropy — giving away nearly 150 million children’s books, for example, and giving each Tennessee wildfire survivor a stipend of $1,000 a month. Just for starters.
