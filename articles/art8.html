The terms are now under review by the Trump administration. By David McCabe, Ana Swanson and Erin Griffith WASHINGTON — After more than six weeks, two White House executive orders, new Chinese regulations and multiple bidders, a deal for the social media app TikTok has boiled down to one main strategy: mitigation. TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese internet company ByteDance, said on Monday that it had offered a proposal to the Treasury Department that aimed to address the Trump administration’s concerns that the app could give the Chinese government access to sensitive data. The proposal is far from an outright sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations, as President Trump suggested in an Aug. 6 executive order. Instead, ByteDance designed a proposal to alleviate the pressure it was facing from China and the United States and to mollify all sides. Specifically, it structured the deal to satisfy some of Mr. Trump’s concerns while dodging new Chinese regulations that could allow Beijing to block an outright sale of TikTok, people with knowledge of the discussions said. Under the terms, TikTok would bring on Oracle, a business software firm that is close with the White House, as a “trusted technology partner.” That role could involve Oracle’s handling TikTok user data not just in the United States but also around the world, one person familiar with the matter said. Oracle would also most likely gain a stake in TikTok, one person with knowledge of the proposal said. While the size of any Oracle investment in TikTok was unclear, Oracle would not be the app’s outright owner, another person said. And TikTok would also not transfer ownership of its valuable recommendation algorithm to Oracle, one person said. Beijing has essentially forbidden such a move. The exact ownership structure for TikTok was still being debated, but some of ByteDance’s current investors are expected to be shareholders of the app, the people added. The deal would give U.S.-based investors voting control over TikTok, even though they may not own a majority of its shares, one person added. Such an arrangement could address concerns from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes investments with a foreign entity and makes a distinction between control and ownership of U.S.-based companies. TikTok would also establish its headquarters in the United States. (It currently has offices in Los Angeles.) With discussions still underway, it’s possible that central details could still change. The proposal now hinges on gaining the support of Mr. Trump, who previously said he was willing to ban TikTok if the app’s U.S. operations were not sold by a Sept. 20 deadline set by his executive order. Mr. Trump’s advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, seem inclined to accept the kind of deal that ByteDance has offered, people familiar with their thinking said. Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Ross, who are both playing a prominent role in reviewing ByteDance’s proposal, have come to favor a solution that would reduce national security and data risks by moving some of TikTok’s key operations out of China, rather than killing the company outright, those people said. There are few strong voices in the administration speaking out against such a deal, with the trade adviser Peter Navarro, a China hawk and one of TikTok’s more vocal critics, playing a minimal role in recent discussions. ByteDance’s carefully designed proposal and the shifting views of Mr. Trump’s advisers indicate how they are more willing to compromise to mitigate an increasingly fractious situation over a video app that is beloved by American teenagers and influencers. On Sunday, ByteDance rejected a deal from Microsoft, in which Microsoft had proposed essentially taking over control of TikTok’s algorithm.
