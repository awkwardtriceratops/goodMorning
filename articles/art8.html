But Are They Safe?<br></h1><p id="artcont">NEW YORK TODAY By Troy Closson [Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Monday. Weather: Gusty all day, with early rain followed by clearing skies. High around 60 is in the morning, but it’ll drop off to the mid-40s by evening. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Thursday (Thanksgiving Day). Pedestrians might begin to see a surge in two-wheeled riders swerving down the streets of New York City. Starting today, electric scooters are now officially legal as New York finally joins other cities across the nation in embracing the transit trend. Fans of the scooters say they are a cheap way to travel. But other New Yorkers view them as a nuisance or worry about the potential danger they pose. Here’s what you need to know about the end of the ban: The new law, which was passed in the summer and went into effect today, means riders across New York City can use their own electric scooters and throttle-controlled electric bicycles, which do not require pedaling. So-called pedal-assist electric bicycles and electric vehicles classified as mopeds, like those rented through Revel, were already permitted. There are a few rules: Riders of electric scooters and throttle-controlled electric bicycles must be over 16. Helmets are required on scooters for those under 18, while on certain types of throttle-controlled bicycles everyone must wear a helmet. After the pandemic began, some lawmakers in New York said there was an increased urgency to act on ending the ban to ease anxieties for those using the electric two-wheeled vehicles to travel to work. “It couldn’t come at a better time during this Covid era,” Councilman Fernando Cabrera, who sponsored the measure, said in a recent interview. “The world is recognizing that we have a new, alternative mode of transportation. For essential workers especially, they’re going to feel more comfortable now.” Electric scooters have taken off in dozens of cities, including San Francisco, Atlanta and Washington, over the past three years. In New Jersey, the devices became legal last year and flooded the streets of Hoboken — quickly drawing criticism about the recklessness of some riders. In 2019, the New York Police Department issued more than 1,100 summonses related to the use of electric bicycles and scooters. But some groups, including the largely immigrant force of delivery workers, still used them, and earlier this year Mayor Bill de Blasio directed the police to suspend enforcement as demand for deliveries surged during the pandemic. Lawmakers in New York were long reluctant to formally end the ban, with some worrying that the vehicles would be too dangerous in a city that before the pandemic was incredibly congested. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo vetoed a bill last December that would have legalized them, because certain safety measures were not required. A study of scooter accidents in Austin, Texas, last year found that nearly half of the 190 riders injured there had suffered head injuries. At two hospitals in Southern California, another study found, the vehicles left 249 people in emergency rooms over a one-year period. Still, the study in Austin found that many of the injuries could have been prevented if the riders had worn helmets and had taken more precautions. The report also called for additional training, since a majority of the wounded riders were relatively new to using the devices. A pilot program for shared electric scooters is planned to start by May. The program, which is to last no more than two years, will exclude Manhattan and prioritize neighborhoods without myriad transit options, though details are still in the works. Still, several app-based rental companies, including Bird, Lime and Spin — some of which spent hundreds of thousands on lobbying for the devices — are already hoping to form roots in one of the few untapped large markets. “This is something that has become an essential service in so many communities, and we hope to see the same in New York,” said Maurice Henderson, a senior director of government partnerships at Bird.
