His social media accounts showed strong support for officers. By Neil MacFarquhar He signed up to be a cadet in a program for teenagers who aspire to be police officers. He filled his Facebook page with support for Blue Lives Matter. He sat upfront at a rally for President Trump in January, and posted images of it on TikTok. And he chose to mark his 16th birthday by raising funds for a support group for the police called Humanizing the Badge. Now, at age 17, Kyle H. Rittenhouse is charged with homicide in a shooting that took place as counterprotesters sparred with demonstrators in Kenosha, Wis. He was there on Tuesday night as demonstrators filled the streets to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a white police officer. Mr. Rittenhouse, who is white, was carrying a military-style rifle and a medical kit, and stood amid a group of armed men who declared that they were protecting the area from fires and looting in protests that had turned destructive on earlier nights. “People are getting injured and our job is to protect this business,” Mr. Rittenhouse said early that evening in an interview with The Daily Caller, an online news and opinion site. He had come to Kenosha from his home in Antioch, Ill., 30 minutes away. “Part of my job also is to protect people,” he said. “If someone is hurt, I’m running into harm’s way. That’s why I have my rifle; I’ve got to protect myself obviously. But I also have my med kit.” Hours later, two people were fatally shot, and a third wounded, as the groups — protesters and counterprotesters — clashed in a darkened, chaotic street. Killed were Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, whose friends said he was protesting against the shooting of Mr. Blake. Mr. Rittenhouse, who faces six criminal counts, including first-degree reckless homicide, first-degree intentional homicide and attempted first-degree intentional homicide, was arrested at his home in Illinois on Wednesday morning, and was expected to appear in court there on Friday to determine whether he will be extradited to Wisconsin. He was being held in a juvenile detention facility in Lake County, Ill. Joy Gossman, the Lake County public defender, who is representing him in the extradition case, declined to comment on whether he would fight the transfer. A message left for Mr. Rittenhouse’s family members went unanswered. Video footage from the night provided many images of Mr. Rittenhouse, in an olive green T-shirt and a baseball cap with an American flag, sometimes marching alongside members of various armed groups, including the Kenosha Guard, a local militia. Through the evening, he portrayed himself as having shifting roles — helper to injured people, cleaner of graffiti that had been left on walls, armed defender of property. There are no overt links on Mr. Rittenhouse’s social media accounts to militias or white supremacist groups who have dispatched armed men to protest events across the country.
