Struggling Booksellers Have, Too.<br></h1><p id="artcont">“A Promised Land” is a potential lifeline for booksellers whose sales have plummeted during the pandemic. By Alexandra Alter and Elizabeth A. Harris Shortly after President Barack Obama left office in 2017, in the aftermath of a contentious election that cost his party the presidency, he sat down with a yellow notepad and began writing an account of his time in the White House. Nearly four years later, Mr. Obama is preparing to release his book in the wake of another volatile and polarizing presidential race. His memoir, “A Promised Land,” arrives at a moment of deep political, cultural and social unrest — tensions that have been heightened by a global pandemic and an economic crisis. It’s a challenging environment, to say the least, in which to release a book, even one of the most highly anticipated of the decade. Bookstores have limited their foot traffic to comply with public health measures, and many customers are still wary of in-person shopping. At the same time, supply chains are under intense strain as capacity issues at printing presses have delayed dozens of books this fall. But in spite of such setbacks, “A Promised Land” is shaping up to be one of the top-selling political memoirs of all time, and a potential lifeline for booksellers whose sales have plummeted during the pandemic. Mr. Obama’s publisher, Crown, is printing 3.4 million copies of “A Promised Land” for the United States and Canadian market, and another 2.5 million for international readers. The book, which runs to 768 pages, is being released simultaneously around the world, and will be available in 19 languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, Finnish, Romanian and Chinese (translations into six other languages are still underway). Demand among American customers is so high that Penguin Random House, Crown’s parent company, has printed 1.5 million copies in Germany to bring over on cargo ships. It still may not be enough to meet demand. Barnes & Noble is stocking around half a million copies of the former president’s book, but the chain expects to sell even more than that, based on the preorders for “A Promised Land” and the strong sales of Michelle Obama’s memoir, “Becoming,” published two years ago. “We are taking as many as Penguin Random House will give us,” said James Daunt, the chief executive of Barnes & Noble. “If there was an unlimited supply, we would take more. I think we will end up selling an enormous number.” Big box stores are also placing large orders. ReaderLink, which supplies books to major chains like Target, Walmart and Costco, expects to receive 890,000 copies by the end of the month, said Dennis E. Abboud, the company’s chief executive. For struggling independent stores, Mr. Obama’s book — with a $45 list price — could prove crucial in recovering some of the losses suffered during the shutdown.
