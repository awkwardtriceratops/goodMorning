Oregon would go further with a proposal to decriminalize drugs like heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine. By Kirk Johnson Oregon has an addiction problem. Pockets of rural poverty, chronic homelessness and cities with lots of young people have given the state one of the highest rates of substance abuse in the nation. It is also, because there is so little money allocated to it, one of the toughest places to get treatment. A proposed solution on the ballot next week would be one of the most radical drug-law overhauls in the nation’s history, eliminating criminal penalties entirely for personal use amounts of drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine. New tax revenues from drug sales would be channeled toward drug treatment. Supporters of the Oregon proposal, Measure 110, say the swirling, transformational forces of 2020 — the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the wave of social unrest over race, policing and incarceration — have highlighted a need for top-to-bottom change. Opponents say decriminalization courts disaster by normalizing drugs that carry the risk of deadly addiction.
