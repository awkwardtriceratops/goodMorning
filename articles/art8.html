He was working on something big, bringing a force of history back to life. “I didn’t even know why he was asking me to come by,” the artist Wildcat Ebony Brown recalled. “It was a bit like a mad scientist-type of situation.” In and out of the studio in those first few weeks of the year were loose groupings of luminaries like the artist José Parlá; the hip-hop pioneer Fab 5 Freddy; Rujeko Hockley, Mr. Thomas’s wife and a curator of the 2019 Whitney Biennial; Tariq Trotter (also known as Black Thought) of the Roots; the restaurateur Tracey Ryans; Carly Fischer, a former researcher at the Whitney Museum; and Eric Gottesman, a photographer and Mr. Thomas’s collaborator on For Freedoms, an artist-led political action committee they founded in 2016. Mr. Thomas said he wanted the Navy Yard crew — and eventually thousands of autonomous artist-activists around the world — “to set the tone for creativity, and the value of creativity in liberation, through community, through love and commemoration.” But first, he needed to share with them an obscure historical precedent, a story familiar almost exclusively to historians and Civil War re-enactors. Even before the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests that would come to define the spring and summer of 2020, Mr. Thomas had been inspired by another moment, 160 years ago, when a political awakening around racial justice, immigration and workers’ rights coincided with a high-stakes presidential election. Entering his cavernous studio, visitors encountered whiteboards scrawled with notes, and an array of 19th-century images printed out from the internet — vintage campaign ribbons and banners, political cartoons, photos of young white men posing sternly in black capes and illustrated scenes of the men marching through the streets of New York and other cities, carrying lit torches. “They looked a bit frightening to me. It looked like maybe a group of guys that I wouldn’t want to run into on the street,” Ms. Brown, the artist, said. “White men with torches. I mean, it kind of conjures up feelings of Charlottesville. But then you learn, like, Oh, no, actually they were abolitionists.” The caped figures in the 1860s engravings adorning the walls of the studio were the Wide Awakes, a rowdy movement of young men (and occasionally women) who staged dramatic rallies in the streets of Northern cities. Under the banner of “Free Speech, Free Soil, Free Men,” they marched and sang and caused a scene, to whip up enthusiasm for the nascent Republican Party and its nominee for president, Abraham Lincoln. Mr. Thomas first came across pictures of the Wide Awakes about a decade ago, and they remained in the back of his mind. In recent months, with Ms. Fischer, Mr. Gottesman and others, he started compiling more research, he said, with the idea of creating a network of makers and doers in the spirit of the Wide Awakes and “the nonviolent, entertaining, visionary work that they were trying to do.” Like the Lincoln-loving boys in their matching capes, this new thing would have to be joyful. “If being civically engaged feels like a burden this season, we’re not going to have the level of impact we think we should,” Mr. Thomas said. “They’re called political parties. Let’s make it a party.” The original Wide Awakes came about organically as well. In March 1860, a Kentucky abolitionist named Cassius Clay visited Hartford, Conn., to campaign on behalf of the Republican candidate for governor, and a small cohort of supporters accompanied him to and from his speech, carrying leaky kerosene torches and wearing oilcloth capes and caps to protect themselves from the dripping oil. The crowds were impressed, and the look caught on. By summer, there were clubs in virtually every major Northern city, parading in military formations by the hundreds, if not thousands. Even many Northerners, however, were troubled by the Wide Awakes, particularly the existence of clubs of Black Wide Awakes in cities like Boston and Chicago. The Bedford Gazette of Pennsylvania, which operated halfway between Gettysburg and Pittsburgh, reprinted news of a Boston parade, alarmed by 100 Black marchers “right side by side with white men, and shouting for Lincoln!” The paper asked, “White men of Pennsylvania, can you, will you support such a party?” More alarmed, of course, were newspapers in the South, which reported the Wide Awakes’ unarmed but well-drilled demonstrations as a menacing sign that the North was preparing to invade if Lincoln were elected. To defend against this imagined threat of violent radicals, places like Charleston, S.C., Augusta, Ga., and New Orleans raised their own local militias called “Minute Men.” When such tensions broke into actual war, after Lincoln’s inauguration, many of the Wide Awakes were among the first wave to join the Union army. And apparently the oilcloth was a perfect bit of infantry gear. One of the young Hartford Wide Awakes wrote home in 1861, asking his parents to send his cape, which he said “will be handy for rainy weather much more than a blanket, as they are the right shape.”
