But it was my depression that almost upended my dream of motherhood. By Sophie Sills Motherhood was a dream of love planted in my heart before I was born, always a “when,” never an “if.” Even after I divorced at 34, childless, I still assumed my future would follow the date-marry-procreate blueprint I’d always imagined. But four years, dozens of dates and not a single serious boyfriend later, it seemed that a husband’s second coming was unlikely in my immediate future. That’s when I started researching artificial insemination in earnest. But it seemed as if you had to be either a high-powered career woman or lesbian couple to seek a stranger’s sperm. Aren’t there women like me, I wondered — not partnered, yet to achieve their full earnings potential — who have managed to become a mama? I spent months agonizing over these two strikes against me. But it was the one I’d considered least — my depression — that almost upended my dream of motherhood. Sitting with my writing group one morning after receiving an “I don’t see this working out” text the night before from the man who I’d been seeing, the second of the summer, I blurted out, “If my life at 47 is the same it was at 27, I’d rather not live it.” Our literary pack leader, Alison, called a coffee break and led me by the elbow to a hibiscus-shaded corner of the patio. “I’m going to be the nosy auntie here giving unsolicited advice,” she said. “I think you should do it on your own.” “Have a baby?” I asked. “You’ll never regret it. There is great power in taking control of what you want,” she said. I’d always wanted a family, not just a baby, but bad luck in love suddenly struck me as an extraneous reason to forsake my fertility. Still, I lived on the scant salary of an adjunct professor with no budget for night nurses or a nanny. The work of feeding, swaddling, soothing and rearing would rest entirely with me. Alison linked her arm with mine and asked if my parents might be willing to help out financially. “Possibly,” I said. Then my spider web of worries began rearranging itself. The longtime hurdle of overcoming my romance problem so I could attend to my desire to have children got knocked down to half its height. I watched my mind recalibrate elements of the impossible into a plan. I’d need a better paying job with benefits. Not unfeasible. My home office would make a sufficient nursery. My two younger siblings lived five minutes away and my parents an hour; I’d not be alone, only un-partnered.
