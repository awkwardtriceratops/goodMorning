On Feb. 11, they witnessed yet another world-record wave, this one ridden by the 33-year-old Brazilian Maya Gabeira, a surfer who almost lost her life to the same wave. Gabeira and her tow partner, Sebastian Steudtner of Germany, were in the lineup in Portugal to compete in the men’s team event at the Nazaré Tow Surfing Challenge. Gabeira, the only woman surfing in the men’s field, was in perfect position when the biggest set of the day rolled in. “I was in the zone,” she said this month from her home in Nazaré. “More brave than I am usually. I got really close to disaster.” Gabeira gripped the tow rope as Steudtner gunned their jet ski to 50 miles per hour, slinging her onto the lip of a cresting giant. She flew down the face of the wave as it curled overhead then crashed in a series of what felt like explosions, Gabeira said, before engulfing her body in white water. “I had never been so close to such a powerful explosion,” she said. “I had never felt that energy and that noise. It felt really terrifying.” This month, a team of private wave engineers and scientists with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of Southern California Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering determined the wave Gabeira rode that day was 73.5 feet, smashing her own previous record by more than five feet. It wasn’t just the biggest wave ever ridden by a woman. It was the biggest wave surfed by anyone during the 2019-20 winter season, a first for women in professional surfing. “I think it’s really important for the next generation of girls growing up to see women accomplishing these things,” said Paige Alms, 32, one of the world’s best big wave surfers. “You can only really dream as big as what you can see.” Gabeira’s run beat out the 70-foot wave surfed by the Nazaré Tow Challenge champion Kai Lenny, also on Feb. 11. It was a Danica Patrick moment for big wave surfing. Not everyone was ready to crown Gabeira, though. Hours after she caught her record-breaking wave, Justine Dupont, a 29-year-old from Southwest France — widely considered one of the top three women in big wave surfing, alongside Gabeira and Alms — caught a wave that some believed was every bit as big as Gabeira’s. Her wave, which was determined to be approximately 70 feet, earned her the women’s crown at Nazaré and ride of the year from the World Surf League. “It’s an imperfect science,” the big wave surfer Greg Long said, “and when we’re talking world records it’s imperative that you bring in a more scientific and specific means.” Michal Pieszka, a surf scientist at Kelly Slater’s wave pool, led the study in collaboration with researchers. They examined the tides, light and shadows, which can affect perception and size in a photograph, and the objects in each picture. They analyzed both camera angles and the camera lenses involved in capturing Gabeira’s and Dupont’s waves. Dupont remains unconvinced of their conclusion.
