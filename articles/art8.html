Dear Diary: Every Wednesday morning at the cafe on Mott Street, Bobby flirts with me. Wednesdays are the days he drives into Manhattan from Brooklyn. He was a gangster, or something shady. He won’t tell me what exactly, except that he worked in construction engineering. I know more than he realizes about the job. My father has worked in the field for 25 years. It used to bother and bewilder me that Bobby would flirt with me. I don’t come across as the type to flirt with, or so I would think, at least to someone like him. But I’ve come to accept it, smile and drink my coffee. People, given time, grow on you. And my boss gets a thrill out of it. — Olivia Funk Dear Diary: The night was warm and sluggish. We had just watched the Yankees lose. My boyfriend and I had left the Stadium, and we were switching trains at Rockefeller Center. There was a teenager wearing a backpack on the platform. He had been in the train car on the way downtown, too, and we had noticed him wiping away tears with the back of his fist. He seemed better now, and we didn’t want to intrude. Then he approached us. “Do you know if the M is running?” he said. Hard to say. It was a weekend night. A train arrived, not ours and not the M. We went up to the operator to ask about the M. We gestured toward the boy, and the operator had a blink of recognition. “Hey, Joey! Joey, get on!” he yelled to the teenager. The boy looked up, and shuffled onto the train. The operator turned back to us. “I’m friends with his older sister,” he said. “I’ll get him home.” The bell sounded, and we stood clear of the closing doors. — Danielle Kim Dear Diary: It was my first trip to the city as an adult. All I wanted was to see a drag queen I had seen once in a magazine. I waited all night at Club Cumming, one eye always on the door. As she got out of her car, I ran up to her, and she held both of my hands in hers. I got goose bumps feeling her long acrylic nails press into my palm. She wore black velvet and lip-synced to Gene Wilders’ speech from “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory” that had always scared me as a child. Then she was gone. The night before I was due home, I went to a tiny bar in Brooklyn hoping to see her one last time. There was only one person sitting on a stool by the door. We told each other stories and laughed about our broken hearts and the pieces we both still carried with us. At dawn, I had to catch my flight.
