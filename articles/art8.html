By Ari Ne’eman Mr. Ne’eman is a disability rights activist and author. Last week, the Supreme Court acquiesced to another attack on the voting rights of all Americans. In a 5-3 decision, the court blocked a trial judge’s ruling permitting Alabama counties to offer curbside voting as a reasonable accommodation to disabled voters. People with disabilities represent over 95 percent of Covid-related deaths in Alabama. Now, they must risk their lives in order to exercise their constitutional rights. Howard Porter Jr. a Black plaintiff with asthma and Parkinson’s disease, testified in the case that many of his ancestors died to vote, but “while I don’t mind dying to vote, I think we’re past that — we’re past that time.” Unfortunately, the Supreme Court disagreed — and with the arrival of Amy Coney Barrett, will likely continue to do so. But even in defeat, Merrill v. People First of Alabama highlights an important truth: Disability rights laws offer a powerful tool to advance civil rights for all Americans. Alabama’s ban on curbside voting was challenged by People First of Alabama, an advocacy organization run by people with developmental disabilities, using the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. People First was represented by civil rights groups like the N.A.A.C.P. and the Southern Poverty Law Center, and its challenge to to the voting restrictions was noteworthy not only because it sought to protect the rights of disabled Alabamians, but because it used a disability rights law to fight a restriction designed to suppress the turnout of Black voters. This is not unprecedented. Disability rights law offers a valuable set of tools for civil rights advocacy of all kinds. Because the ADA requires reasonable accommodations and modifications to enable accessibility, people with disabilities can seek changes to generally applicable policies that are much harder to challenge through other statutes. And because disability is more prevalent among racial and ethnic minorities, disability rights statutes can be applied to a broad range of civil rights problems. Recent litigation challenging the Trump administration’s “public charge” rule, restricting the entry and naturalization of immigrants likely to use social-welfare programs, makes use of disability rights law to protect immigrants. Because the administration sought to penalize immigrants for making use of public services disproportionately or primarily relied upon by people with disabilities, the door was opened for disability and immigration activists to work together in support of a common goal. Nor is the A.D.A. the only disability rights law that offers a useful vehicle for advancing racial justice. During the Obama administration, the Department of Education sought to combat the segregation of minority children into special education classrooms by leveraging the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Though the Trump administration tried to roll back these protections, the courts soon restored them. Now, disability rights and racial justice advocacy groups are working together to establish new protections against restraint and seclusion, disproportionately deployed against students of color and students with disabilities. These groups also target school resource officers, who often send students from both groups down the school-to-prison pipeline. Disability rights law can also be a useful instrument for tackling our country’s serious criminal justice problem. People with disabilities, especially people of color with disabilities, are disproportionately likely to be incarcerated and shot by the police. Civil liberties groups have made use of the A.D.A. to try to force law enforcement to change their practices. Mental illness is often a factor in bringing people into contact with the criminal justice system. Because of this, disability groups are exploring using the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Olmstead v. L.C., which ruled that unjustified institutionalization of people with disabilities is a form of discrimination, to press states to invest in community services to help people with mental illness avoid the prison system. Advocates in California recently brought suit against Alameda County on this basis, seeking to use Olmstead to keep adults with mental illness, especially Black adults, from incarceration and institutionalization. While some seek to turn back the clock to the days of mass institutionalization and easy involuntary commitment, Olmstead and the A.D.A. offer a more useful avenue for tackling criminal justice involvement of people with mental illness, including the people of color who our legal system most marginalizes. In the coming years, the A.D.A. may prove itself a valuable weapon in the fight against mass incarceration. Of course, disability rights laws are not new, and neither are the problems they are being deployed to address. So why is such cross-movement collaboration a relatively recent occurrence? Historically, a disproportionately white disability rights movement has shied away from work on racial justice, preferring the relatively bipartisan support most disability issues once enjoyed. Doing so was a mistake. Disability rights cannot thrive without the broader democratic rights now under attack. More important, disability organizations should not exclude disabled people of color from the constituencies they hold themselves accountable to. At the same time, many traditional civil rights groups are unfamiliar with disability issues. In some circles, disability is still seen as only an outcome of disparities and injustice, not a factor causing them. Fortunately, a growing number of civil rights organizations are considering how to better meet the needs of their disabled constituents. Awareness that disability rights offers powerful tools to address voting rights, school desegregation and criminal justice reform, among other civil rights concerns, has helped accelerate the transition. There is a growing recognition that disability prejudice and racial prejudice interact and often reinforce each other. Addressing either requires confronting both. As the disability and civil rights movements realize how much they have to offer each other, old divides are beginning to narrow. Decisions like Merrill v. People First are disheartening attacks on the democratic rights of disabled and minority voters — but they also illustrate the value of seeing our civil rights laws as part of a larger whole, capable of complementing and supporting each other to become something more than the sum of their parts. The future of our country’s judiciary is more in doubt than ever — but it looks increasingly likely that all of our civil rights laws will rise or fall together. In her powerful dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor not only offered an eloquent defense of the basic principles of disability rights law, she also set the stage for further collaboration between disability rights and racial justice activists. In the years to come, we will continue to discover we are more powerful together than apart.
