A decision on whether to charge the officers is expected on Wednesday afternoon. By Richard A. Oppel Jr., Derrick Bryson Taylor and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs A judge in Kentucky will announce a grand jury’s decision on Wednesday afternoon about whether to indict the officers involved in the killing of Breonna Taylor, a Black medical worker who was shot and killed by Louisville police officers in March during a botched raid on her apartment. The judge in Jefferson County will read the grand jury’s report at a 1:15 p.m. hearing on Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the state court system said. Daniel Cameron, the Republican attorney general who has been investigating the officers’ actions, said he would also hold a news conference at 1:30 p.m., during which he would announce the results of the grand jury inquiry. The killing of Ms. Taylor led to wide-scale demonstrations in the spring and summer as the case drew more attention, and Louisville officials were preparing for more protests on Wednesday following the announcement on whether the officers involved in the raid would be charged. Mayor Greg Fischer of Louisville, a Democrat, declared a state of emergency this week in anticipation of possible “civil unrest” and, on Wednesday, ordered a curfew from 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. for the next three nights. The city’s police chief, Robert J. Schroeder, also placed barricades and city vehicles downtown to restrict movement in the area and said he would not allow officers to request time off. Mr. Cameron said last month that he had received a ballistics report and called it a “critical piece” of the investigation, but he declined to share its findings and has said little about his inquiry, which began in the spring. The Louisville Metro Police Department was also grappling with an email sent to officers on Tuesday morning by a sergeant who fired his gun — and was shot — during the raid of Ms. Taylor’s apartment. “I know we did the legal, moral and ethical thing that night,” Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, who is on administrative leave, wrote in the email, which he sent to fellow officers at 2:06 a.m. and which was later posted online by a Vice News correspondent. Kent Wicker, a lawyer for Sergeant Mattingly, confirmed the email was genuine. During the raid, Sergeant Mattingly was shot once in the leg by Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend as the sergeant entered the apartment. He later said in a statement to investigators that he had fired off at least six rounds in response. In the email to his colleagues, Sergeant Mattingly railed against the Police Department’s command staff, the mayor and the F.B.I. and said “good guys are demonized, and criminals are canonized.” Since the recent national demonstrations over police brutality and systemic racism that began in late May, Louisville officials have banned the use of no-knock warrants, which allow the police to forcibly enter people’s homes to search them without warning, and, in late June, fired one of the officers involved in the shooting. For months, Ms. Taylor’s family has pleaded for justice, pushing for criminal charges against the officers. Ms. Taylor’s case began to draw national attention in May, and she has since been the center of campaigns from several celebrities and athletes, some of whom have dedicated their seasons to keeping a spotlight on her case. In September, Louisville officials agreed to pay $12 million to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by Ms. Taylor’s mother and to institute reforms aimed at preventing future deaths by officers. Still, critics say progress in the case has been slow, especially when compared with the Floyd case, where officers were swiftly fired and charged. “At this point it’s bigger than Breonna, it’s bigger than just Black Lives,” Ms. Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, said over the summer as she beseeched the authorities to bring criminal charges. “We’ve got to figure out how to fix the city, how to heal from here.”
