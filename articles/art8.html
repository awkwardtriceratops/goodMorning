By Theodore J. Iwashyna Dr. Iwashyna is a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan. ANN ARBOR, Mich. — As hospitals in much of the country face a surge in patients with Covid-19 and the threat of influenza this fall and winter, we must be on guard against attempts to restrict patient admissions or limit intensive-care capacity. The incentives will certainly be there for hospitals to do so. During the first Covid-19 surge in the spring, hospitals collectively lost over $200 billion and are on track to lose more than $320 billion overall by the end of the year. Large academic medical centers were forced to forgo lucrative elective procedures as they absorbed high patient loads driven by the coronavirus. But they offer the most severely ill their best shot at survival and must keep their doors open to the sickest patients. The possibility that some hospitals might seek to exclude patients, particularly those who are poor and vulnerable, was underscored recently by a report in The Wall Street Journal that several large California hospital systems “improperly refused or delayed accepting Covid-19 patients based on their insurance status.” Severely ill patients were left waiting for care, the paper reported, and other hospitals swamped by the virus were stretched. That was not an isolated example. In Chicago in May, the pandemic revealed a fragmented and uncoordinated system of transferring patients, according to a report by WBEZ, the public radio station there. Hospitals had “to play a stressful game of ‘who do you know,’ leaning on longstanding relationships to transfer Covid-19 patients,” the station reported. After finding it hard to transfer patients, overwhelmed small hospitals “stopped even trying to send patients,” resigning themselves to making do on their own. In New York at the height of the pandemic in April, The Times reported, “patients at some community hospitals were three times more likely to die as patients at medical centers in the wealthiest parts of the city.” Doctors at two major New York hospital systems complained about inequities in care between their flagship hospitals and satellite facilities. Nationwide data suggest the same story.
