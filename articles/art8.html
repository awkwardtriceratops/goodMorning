By Katie Robertson The New Yorker has fired the star journalist Jeffrey Toobin after an investigation into his behavior during a work video call last month, the magazine’s parent company, Condé Nast, said on Wednesday. As a result of the internal investigation, Mr. Toobin “is no longer affiliated with our company,” Condé Nast’s chief people officer, Stan Duncan, said in a staff note, which was reviewed by The New York Times. Mr. Toobin, 60, reported the news of his firing on Twitter. I was fired today by @NewYorker after 27 years as a Staff Writer. I will always love the magazine, will miss my colleagues, and will look forward to reading their work. In his memo, Mr. Duncan wrote: “I want to assure everyone that we take workplace matters seriously. We are committed to fostering an environment where everyone feels respected and upholds our standards of conduct.” Mr. Toobin did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The New Yorker suspended Mr. Toobin after he exposed himself during a Zoom call with employees of the magazine and WNYC radio. The call was held to discuss a future episode of a podcast that The New Yorker and the public radio station produce. During breakout discussions, Mr. Toobin switched to a second call that was the video-call equivalent of phone sex. “I made an embarrassingly stupid mistake, believing I was off camera,” Mr. Toobin said last month. “I apologize to my wife, family, friends and co-workers.”
