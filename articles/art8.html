By Jill C. Trepanier Dr. Trepanier is a climate scientist at Louisiana State University. Climate science and weather science have made impressive advancements in the 15 years since Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in their ability to track these storms and identify how climate change influences their formation and ferocity. Yet the United States is still woefully unprepared. Our coastlines in many places are overbuilt and lack defenses against storm surge and flooding from heavy rains. And the response in the hours and days after these storms hit is often slow and inadequate. We can change this. To do so, politicians should turn to the scientists who study these storms and how to protect against the catastrophic damage they can inflict.
