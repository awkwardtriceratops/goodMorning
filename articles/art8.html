Their hopes to control the chamber now likely rest on a pair of races in Georgia. By Matt Stevens In the days since Joseph R. Biden Jr. was declared the winner in the presidential contest, the vote counting and reporting in states across the country have continued and are helping to clarify what the Senate will look like in 2021. Democrats did not get the sort of blue wave they had hoped for, and their paths to flipping the Senate have significantly dwindled. In an election cycle in which President Trump ran much closer to Mr. Biden than many of the polls had predicted, Republicans appear poised to hold on to all but two of the roughly dozen seats that were thought to be competitive — and they flipped one seat held by a Democrat. Two critical senate races in Georgia are headed to a runoff, a third race in Alaska, where the Republican candidate is significantly ahead, and a fourth race in North Carolina where the Democratic challenger has conceded, have all yet to be formally called.With the Alaska senate race likely to wind up in the Republicans’ column, it appears that Democrats’ only path to a senate majority will require winning both of Georgia’s senate seats. Here is a quick summary of what has happened in Senate races across the country. Entering Election Day, Republicans held a three-seat advantage over Democrats in the Senate. That meant that in order for Democrats to take control of the chamber in 2021, they needed to flip at least three seats — and most likely four — assuming they also won the White House. If Democrats were to pick up three seats, then Kamala Harris, as vice president, would be able to break a 50-50 tie in the Senate. But Senator Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama, was widely expected to lose his race in the deep red state, so realistically, most Democrats expected they would have to flip a fourth Republican seat.
