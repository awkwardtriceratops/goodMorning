By Jonathan Martin WASHINGTON — President Trump and Senator Lindsey Graham have established clear but not overwhelming advantages in South Carolina, a heavily Republican state that is showing signs of competitiveness this year, according to a new New York Times/Siena College poll. Mr. Trump leads Joseph R. Biden Jr., 49 percentage points to 41, while Mr. Graham, who is facing the most serious challenge of his career, is winning 46 percent of the vote compared with 40 percent for his Democratic rival, Jaime Harrison. Donald Trump holds a clear lead over Joe Biden in South Carolina. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of 605 likely voters in South Carolina from Oct. 9 to Oct. 15. The Senate race, though, may be even more competitive because the survey finds that 12 percent of Black voters are undecided, a vote share that is likely to favor Mr. Harrison, who is African-American. The poll has a margin of error of 4.5 percentage points. No Democratic presidential candidate has carried South Carolina since Jimmy Carter in 1976, a streak that appears unlikely to be broken this year. But the combination of Black voters and white transplants there is poised to make the state more of a battleground than an afterthought going forward. It’s this coalition of voters that’s pushing Mr. Trump’s advantage into single-digits, four years after he carried South Carolina by 14 points, and that has made the race between Mr. Graham and Mr. Harrison perhaps the most surprisingly close Senate matchup of 2020. Republican incumbent Lindsey Graham polls ahead of his Democratic challenger in this surprisingly competitive Senate race.  Still, South Carolina remains more conservative than its fast-changing neighbors, Georgia and North Carolina, and quite forbidding for Democrats. The state hasn’t elected a Democratic governor or senator since 1998. While college-educated white voters in other Sun Belt states favor Mr. Biden or break even between the two presidential contenders, they favor Mr. Trump 50 percent to 38 percent in South Carolina. Even more stark, and for Democrats downright daunting, is the gap between white voters without a college degree: 77 percent favor Mr. Trump while just 18 percent support Mr. Biden. There is far more uncertainty in the Senate race. After being one of Mr. Trump’s fiercest critics in the 2016 campaign, Mr. Graham has become one of his most loyal lieutenants. This shift, along with the skepticism Mr. Graham has faced from far-right Republicans because of his penchant for deal-making, has made him vulnerable to a challenge. And Mr. Harrison, a former lobbyist who served as the South Carolina Democratic Party chairman, has emerged as a fund-raising dynamo: He just shattered the record for Senate fund-raising in a quarter, netting $57 million in the three months from July through September. Jason Strickland, a 44-year-old Republican from Summerville, S.C., lamented Mr. Graham’s willingness to compromise, citing immigration as an example. Mr. Strickland criticized what he called Mr. Graham’s push for “amnesty,” a reference to the senator’s yearslong effort to broker a bipartisan immigration overhaul that would include a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally.
