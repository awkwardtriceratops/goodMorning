By Jennifer Harlan On a blustery day in May, Vanessa Fransen rolled her wagon up to a house in Makoti, N.D. She deposited a bundle on the doormat, rang the doorbell and sprinted away. But this wasn’t your typical ding-dong-ditch: When her neighbors opened their door, they found a bag full of books. “May Day surprise!” Vanessa hollered. In the midst of the pandemic, this was the way that Vanessa, 12, helped people in her community feel less alone. Her desire to make a difference through books began two years ago, when she saw a Little Free Library box in a neighboring town. Makoti does not have a public library, and residents rely on a county bookmobile or travel dozens of miles for library services. The Free Library’s free-standing model seemed like a great fit. “It was all her idea,” Vanessa’s mother, Laura Fransen, said. “I didn’t even know Little Free Libraries were a thing. And then we found out it’s a worldwide, global phenomenon.” Donate now to the 109th annual campaign of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. All proceeds go to 10 organizations providing assistance to those facing economic hardship. Make a tax-deductible donation through GoFundMe. In 2018, Vanessa installed the library in her town square. The next summer, she added a community garden, so that Makoti residents could enjoy a snack and view along with a book. This spring, when the coronavirus brought everything to a halt — including the bookmobile — Vanessa saw another opportunity to help. With a grant from First Book, one of 10 organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Vanessa purchased 160 books to distribute to more than 40 families across her community. “We tried to pick books that their families could use,” Ms. Fransen said, including cookbooks and coloring books with postcards people could send to loved ones. In August and October, Vanessa worked with First Book again, this time focusing on Makoti’s younger residents. Through the nonprofit, she got 140 additional books; 90 of them were from the Magic Tree House series and were provided thanks to a donation from the author, Mary Pope Osborne. She distributed them to children around her community as well as to a local school and the Little Free Library. Vanessa, who recently started seventh grade, hopes Ms. Osborne’s books, which combine history and education with adventure, will help children feel less isolated. “What I love about reading is that it takes you to different places and you learn about new things,” she said. Ms. Fransen added, “Right now, when everything’s being taught virtually, it’s important for kids to have a tangible book in their hands.” It’s been particularly rewarding, Vanessa says, to know she’s making a difference where she lives. Joyce Bryant and Virginia Moses, friends from Brooklyn who are both 70, echoed that sentiment. They are retired — Ms. Bryant was a home care worker, and Ms. Moses worked at an electronics store — but neither is content to relax.
