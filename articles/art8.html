By Andy Slavitt and Nicholas Bagley Mr. Slavitt ran the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2015 to 2017. Mr. Bagley teaches law at the University of Michigan. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death could not have come at a worse time for the millions of Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. One week after the election, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear yet another case about whether the law is constitutional. The case was worrisome enough when Chief Justice John Roberts held the swing vote. But if President Trump succeeds in seating a new justice, the political gravity of the court will lurch even further to the right. A case that once looked like a Hail Mary would stand a real chance of success. That means more than ever, health care is on the ballot. Joe Biden has already tied the battle over President Trump’s Supreme Court appointee to the fate of health reform, and Democrats should keep banging that drum until Election Day. What’s at stake is not just the coverage that millions of Americans have gained through the new insurance exchanges and the Medicaid expansion but also the parts of the law that protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. Other popular provisions hang in the balance, including those that guarantee preventive care with no out-of-pocket payments; end lifetime caps; allow kids to stay on their parents’ insurance through age 26; and make vaccines free to patients. Even some key improvements to Medicare — including a reduction in prescription drug costs for beneficiaries — would be gone. Overnight, if the Affordable Care Act is eliminated, we will return to the health care system of 2010 — all this as we battle a virus that has killed more than 200,000 Americans. Indeed, contracting the virus is the ultimate pre-existing condition. The disease can bring with it mysterious complications and affect virtually every organ system, the immune system and even the limbs. Young, otherwise healthy people may find themselves uninsurable if the Affordable Care Act is struck down. Testing and contact tracing will also suffer if people become reluctant to disclose their illnesses, as happened routinely before Obamacare. The lawsuit stems from Congress’s tax cut legislation in late 2017, which ended the tax penalty for going without health insurance. The Affordable Care Act, however, still had language saying that people “shall” buy health insurance. Without the penalty, the “shall” instruction was meaningless — a vestige of an earlier version of Obamacare. A group of red states led by Texas, however, built a tortured argument on top of that one word. By keeping “shall” while ending the penalty, they said, Congress must have meant to coerce people into buying insurance. And that kind of congressional coercion is unconstitutional. Furthermore, they claimed that the entire law must go because one part of it couldn’t be legally “severed” from another. This whole line of argument is preposterous. Commentators and legal scholars on the left and right agree on that point. The Republican-controlled Congress didn’t vote to make the individual mandate more coercive than it was before. It voted to make it less coercive by scotching the only mechanism for enforcing it. Instead of defending the law against the attack, however, President Trump decided to use the lawsuit as a vehicle for undoing the Affordable Care Act in the courts. Yet even as President Trump has tried to eliminate Obamacare, the law has only grown in popularity. The more the law is threatened, the more the public realizes its value.
