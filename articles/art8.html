Democrats would still be confronted with a radical Republican Party. By Adam Jentleson Mr. Jentleson was a deputy chief of staff for Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. Buckle up, Democrats, because the time between now and Election Day will be a white-knuckled, cannonball run of doom-scrolling. Joe Biden holds a lead in the polls, giving Democrats hope that President Trump will be soundly defeated in November. That’s the good news. Here’s the bad news: Beating President Trump is just the beginning. If Mr. Biden wins and if Mr. Trump leaves office peacefully — two big ifs — Democrats will be confronted with a more intractable problem: The Republican Party is the party of Donald Trump, and it is not likely to change. If Mr. Biden wins, there will be a temptation to embrace a big lie: Mr. Trump was the problem, and with him gone, the Republican Party can return to normal. But today’s Republican Party won’t moderate itself, because Trumpism is its natural state. Democrats should avoid the temptation to expect Republican cooperation in governing this country. Mr. Trump won the 2016 nomination because the party’s voters embraced him enthusiastically. At the time, the strength of that embrace was obscured by the high-profile ambivalence of Republican leaders like Paul Ryan, then the speaker of the House. But Republican voters’ feelings about Mr. Trump were never particularly complicated. Within a month of entering the primary, Mr. Trump took a polling lead and, beside a brief surge by Ben Carson, never lost it. In 2016, Mr. Trump didn’t change the Republican Party; he met it where it was. The party had been ready for him for years: In 2012, the congressional scholars Thomas Mann of the center-left Brookings Institution and Norm Ornstein of the conservative American Enterprise Institute wrote, “The G.O.P. has become an insurgent outlier in American politics.” More recent studies, including by Pippa Norris of Harvard, have confirmed this assessment. In a brief summary of her research — which compared the U.S. Republican Party “with other major parties in O.E.C.D. societies” — she found the G.O.P. “near far-right European parties” that flirt with authoritarianism, like the Polish Law and Justice of Poland or the Turkish Justice and Development parties. This is not a party poised to pivot toward moderation — even in the face of an electoral landslide loss. The inevitable calls for reform (like the party’s abandoned “autopsy” report after the 2012 election) will yield to the inescapable gravitational pull of the party’s own voters and the larger forces dominating our politics. Instead of moderates, Republicans may be more likely to turn to reactionary politicians like Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. A first-term senator with few substantive legislative accomplishments, Mr. Cotton rocketed to fame through his provocative actions against Democrats. In 2015, for example, he tried to sabotage President Barack Obama’s nuclear negotiations with Iran, organizing an open letter (signed by over 40 Republican senators) sent to Iran’s leaders declaring the American president’s commitments potentially null and void. If Mr. Trump loses, Mr. Cotton is seen as a leading contender for the 2024 Republican nomination.
