Joe Biden’s team says the president must prove he’s not contagious. By Katie Glueck and Apoorva Mandavilli The last time President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. debated each other, the nation was left grappling with Mr. Trump’s attack on election integrity, his refusal to categorically condemn white supremacists and bitter exchanges of a type rarely seen in American presidential politics. That was last week. Now, in a stark reminder of the tumultuous nature of the 2020 race, all of those issues — which are of significant importance to American voters — have been eclipsed in the political dialogue by a fight over health precautions and transparency that is set to define the next presidential debate, scheduled for Oct. 15. Mr. Trump, who has tested positive for the coronavirus, has insisted that he is “looking forward” to the debate in Miami, despite great uncertainties about what his condition will be then. Mr. Biden and his team, for their part, are seeking to place the onus for a safe debate on the president, the Commission on Presidential Debates and officials from the Cleveland Clinic, who are advising on health and safety for the matchups. “If he still has Covid, we shouldn’t have a debate,” Mr. Biden told reporters on Tuesday night after delivering a campaign speech in Gettysburg, Pa. “I will be guided by the guidelines of the Cleveland Clinic and what the docs say is the right thing to do.” Mr. Biden’s advisers have emphasized that he intends to participate in any debate that takes place, noting that the scheduled format is town-hall-style, and they have said that the former vice president wants the chance to interact with voters. But they and other allies have also said that Mr. Trump must prove that he is not contagious, and that responsibility lies with the debate organizers and the president himself to show that he meets those standards. “This is his obligation to meet,” Kate Bedingfield, a deputy Biden campaign manager, told CNN on Wednesday morning. “He needs to prove that he’s not contagious.” In a follow-up statement, a spokesman for Mr. Biden, T.J. Ducklo, said: “The Commission on Presidential Debates and the Cleveland Clinic will determine the health and safety protocols for next week’s debate. This is their responsibility, and we expect they will take it seriously.” For Mr. Trump, demonstrating that he is not infectious will be far from simple. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asks people with mild symptoms to isolate at home for 10 days, by which time they should stop being infectious. But some people with moderate or severe illness can stay infectious for 20 days or perhaps even longer. If the president takes a turn for the worse, “then that whole 10-day window has just gone to hell,” said Dr. Esther K. Choo, an emergency medicine physician at Oregon Health and Science University. “We want to feel really good that we’re not going to create a second super-spreader event.” Earlier in the pandemic, the C.D.C. recommended two negative tests to indicate that a patient was no longer infectious. Since then, studies have shown that people with the illness can shed dead virus for weeks even if they are no longer contagious. That can result in a false positive result.
