A bipartisan group of senators says the Pentagon should find money in its huge budget to continue funding. By Helene Cooper WASHINGTON — Stars and Stripes, the military newspaper that has both informed and spoken for American troops over the decades, will cease print and online publication by the last day of September, expanding the Trump administration’s war on news media to include those paid by the government to cover the military. Begun during the Civil War, “Stripes” has more recently frustrated presidents and defense secretaries during the “Forever Wars” that began in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by elevating the voices of those in uniform who contradicted commanders and political leaders. But while the newspaper found enough backers in Congress and among retired military officers to keep it alive during previous administrations, that support has been unable to reverse Defense Department plans to zero-out the Stars and Stripes budget during a Trump presidency marked by ongoing battles with journalists. A bipartisan group of eleven Democratic and four Republican senators called on the Defense Department to maintain funding for the publication, which has around 1.3 million readers online and in print. In a letter on Wednesday to Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, the senators said the Pentagon, with its budget of more than $700 billion, could surely find the $15.5 million in federal funding needed to keep Stars and Stripes going. “We urge you to take steps to preserve the funding prerogatives of Congress before allowing any such disruption to take place,” said the letter, signed by, among others, Senators Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California; Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois; and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. “Stars and Stripes is an essential part of our nation’s freedom of the press that serves the very population charged with defending that freedom.” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, sent a separate letter to Mr. Esper last month on behalf of the publication, and cited “strong support” for Stars and Stripes in Congress. “As a veteran who has served overseas, I know the value that the Stars and Stripes brings to its readers,” wrote Mr. Graham, a former Air Force Reserve lawyer who retired as a colonel. The challenge facing Stars and Stripes — maintaining editorial independence from the government while depending on government funding — is playing out in other parts of the Trump administration. Similar efforts to weaken federally funded news outlets are underway at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees international broadcast outlets like Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcast Networks.
