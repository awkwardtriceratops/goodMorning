By Julia Jacobs and Zachary Small The Whitney Museum of American Art on Tuesday canceled an upcoming exhibition after artists of color objected to the institution obtaining their art through discounted sales largely meant to benefit racial justice charities, accusing the museum of trying to capitalize on their work without properly compensating them. The exhibition, called “Collective Actions: Artist Interventions in a Time of Change,” was intended to feature work by artists who participated in projects responding to the coronavirus pandemic and Black Lives Matter demonstrations. On Tuesday morning, there was an outpouring of criticism on social media after artists received emails saying that their work would be included in the exhibition, which was to open on Sept. 17, two weeks after the Whitney plans to reopen. Y'all. YALL. This is unreal. I'm... First of all I'll never do another print sale again so please no that ahead of time. @whitneymuseum y'all preyed on Black artists in this moment in such a disgusting way. No scruples. An embarrassment. pic.twitter.com/uhEvQEKTT7 The notice from Farris Wahbeh, the Whitney’s director of research resources, landed in the photographer Dana Scruggs’ inbox on Monday night, reading: “I’m writing to let you know that I have acquired your work.” Ms. Scruggs learned in the email that the museum had obtained an untitled print that she had made available to See in Black, a coalition of Black photographers that sold artists’ work at the reduced rate of $100 per print to benefit Black communities. Normally, a print of hers would sell for thousands of dollars, but this time, the sales went to charitable causes. To Ms. Scruggs, the intention behind donating her work was to put art in the hands of people who weren’t typically able to afford it. The Whitney, Ms. Scruggs reasoned, was able to afford it. Ms. Scruggs wrote back, “Not that you even deigned to ask me, but NO you cannot exhibit my work without my permission.” The form of compensation that the museum offered in the email was particularly frustrating to some of the artists on the receiving end of it: a lifetime pass granting them free entry to the museum. The process also seemed unreasonable to some because many artists are in tough financial straits during the pandemic and need the paid work now more than ever. “If you actually took me and any of the other photographers you ‘acquired’ seriously as artists,” Ms. Scruggs wrote in the email to Mr. Wahbeh, “you would never have pulled something as manipulative, offensive, and cheap as what you’re trying to do.” Several other artists who donated their work to the See in Black sale — which was raising money for organizations such as the National Black Justice Coalition and the Bail Project — were also informed that their work would be on view in the exhibition.
