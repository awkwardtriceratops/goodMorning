Now I Go to The Home Depot.<br></h1><p id="artcont">How the coronavirus turned me into a Lawn Dad. By Anne Helen Petersen Ms. Petersen writes the newsletter Culture Study. I’ve spent the spring and summer becoming a verified Lawn Dad: the sort of person who fills their time fine-tuning sprinkler patterns and surveying their handiwork each morning with a cup of coffee in hand. I spent a May afternoon hacking away an ancient juniper, an entire day pruning an unruly lilac. Piles of bark were spread. A patio was redone. An entire deck was sanded and re-stained. These DIY activities are at once meditative and deeply fulfilling. I start a thing, I work at it and I get the catharsis of finishing it. In past years, my time was so packed that I’d only wedge in a few, mandatory days for maintenance. But this year, the pandemic has allowed my days and weeks and months to pool together into an undifferentiated mass. I don’t want to eat at a restaurant, even though they’re open here in Montana. I don’t feel like buying stuff. But I still have all this self-optimizing energy, and, because I can work from home, a fierce desire to do something other than stare at my computer all day. So I go to the backyard. And then I go to the hardware store. I’m not alone. The Home Depot recently announced record quarterly profits. And unlike most businesses, home improvement stores haven’t had decreases in foot traffic during the pandemic. Americans are so used to doing — and spending, and bettering themselves — and that energy has to go somewhere: like into the spaces we’ve been forced to inhabit for the past six months. So I asked my Twitter feed: who else has spent quarantine slowly transforming into a Lawn Dad? I heard from hundreds of people — one of whom was Javi Zubizarreta, who lives in South Bend, Ind., where he’s devoted himself to his garden. He planted specific flowers to attract wildlife, and put out bird feeders for the first time in his life. “It’s incredible, to be that person that’s like, oh, here’s the chickadees!,” he said. “For me, it’s a reminder that life is continuing, even if yours isn’t.” “I planted eight hydrangeas,” Mr. Zubizarreta told me. “But then we had this freak cold snap, and it nearly wiped them all out. They were these shriveled brown nubs of nothing. My emotions around the pandemic became so tightly tied up in these plants.”
