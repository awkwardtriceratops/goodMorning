In doing so, they have regularly exaggerated Mr. Trump’s accomplishments in office, glossed over or misled about his efforts in confronting the coronavirus pandemic and twisted the record of his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. A team of New York Times reporters are following the developments and fact-checking the speakers, providing context and explanation. By Emily Cochrane — Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader The House earlier this year approved statehood for the 700,000 people who live in the nation’s capital, the first time a chamber of Congress has approved establishing the nation’s capital as a state. At the time, District Mayor Muriel Bowser said that it would lay the groundwork for the legislation to be approved in 2021, if Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected president and Democrats took the Senate. But the legislation would set aside the National Mall, the White House, Capitol Hill and some other federal property — where the so-called swamp resides — to remain under congressional jurisdiction. The rest of the land would become the new state, allowing Ms. Bowser and the Washington government to take full control of the places where Washingtonians actually live. The legislation gained traction earlier this year because the administration flooded the streets with National Guard forces and federal agents in riot gear during protests over the death of George Floyd over the objections of Ms. Bowser, who had few options because of how much control Congress maintains over the district’s finances and laws. By Ana Swanson — Debbie Flood, Wisconsin machine shop owner Joseph R. Biden Jr. did vote to normalize trade with China in 2000, as did many lawmakers in both parties — the bill passed the Senate with a vote of 83 to 15. However, at that point, China was still a less developed country that did not appear to pose much of an economic threat to the United States. Mr. Biden noted as much in his speech on the Senate floor before the 2000 vote, saying he did not foresee “the collapse of the American manufacturing economy, as China, a nation with the impact on the world economy about the size of the Netherlands’, suddenly becomes our major economic competitor.” By Jeanna Smialek — Dan Scavino, White House deputy chief of staff and President Trump’s director of social media To the extent that claims about the “best” economy are provable — and that extent is limited — the 2017 to 2020 economy does not meet the mark. Unemployment was at a more than 50-year low before the pandemic, but it has been lower. Participation rates, the share of people who are working or looking, have been much higher. Inequality is elevated. Growth remained near its recent 2 percent trend — historically, relatively tepid — before plunging headlong into the sharpest recession since the Great Depression at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. By Coral Davenport — Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California The phrase “energy independence” suggests that the United States does not depend on energy imports, but the United States still relies significantly on imports of oil and natural gas. In 2019, nearly half the oil consumed by the United States was imported — about 9 million barrels per day were imported of the roughly 20 million barrels per day that were consumed.
