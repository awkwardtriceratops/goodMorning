RIGHT NOW W.N.B.A. officials announced a plan to resume the league’s games on Friday night. The league’s athletes had dedicated the season, which started in July, to amplifying social justice causes. Jacob Blake, the Black resident of Kenosha, Wis., who was shot by a white police officer, is shackled to his hospital bed, his father said on Friday morning, adding that his son remains paralyzed from the waist down. In an interview with CNN, Jacob Blake Sr. said that he had been able to speak with his son at the hospital on Wednesday, but that conversation was limited because his son was heavily medicated and in intense pain. “My son is fighting for his life,” he said. It was unclear why Mr. Blake would be confined to his hospital bed with an ankle shackle. The authorities have said that the police were arresting Mr. Blake on Sunday afternoon when an officer shot him seven times, but they have not said what charges he was facing or offered other details of the shooting. The shooting set off demonstrations in Kenosha and in cities across the country. “When I got to his side, he grabbed my hands and began to weep,” the elder Mr. Blake said of his son. He said his son asked, “‘Why did they shoot me so many times?’ And I said, ‘Baby, they weren’t supposed to shoot you at all.’” Three of Mr. Blake’s children — ranging from 3 to 8 years old — were in the back of the car that Mr. Blake was climbing into as he was shot. “In his mind’s eye, he just wanted to get his sons out of harm’s way, but before he could get them out of the car he was just counting shots,” Mr. Blake’s father said his son had told him. “He said he was counting them. I guess he lost consciousness around number four or five.” He said he did not know why his son had been shackled to the bed. “Why do they have that cold steel on my son’s ankle?” he said. “He couldn’t get up if he wanted to. So that’s a little overkill to have him shackled to the bed.” A lawyer for the family, Ben Crump, said that Mr. Blake's injuries are severe, including damage to his bowels, shattered vertebrae and bullet fragments in his spinal cord. He has undergone several surgeries, Mr. Blake’s father said, and it was unclear whether the paralysis would be permanent. Also on Friday, the Wisconsin Department of Justice revealed new details about the shooting of Mr. Blake. The department had previously reported that one officer had fired a Taser in a failed attempt to stop Mr. Blake, but on Friday said Officers Rusten Sheskey and Vincent Arenas had both discharged their Tasers before Officer Sheskey shot Mr. Blake seven times in the back. A third officer, Brittany Meronek was also present at the scene, the department said.  All three officers have been put on administrative leave. Kyle Rittenhouse, a white teenager who took to the streets of Kenosha, Wis., armed with a military-style rifle this week and is accused of killing two people in a shooting that took place amid a skirmish between demonstrators and counterprotesters, is being held for the time being in Lake County, Ill. Mr. Rittenhouse, 17, was arrested at his home in Antioch, Ill. this week. He faces six criminal counts, including first-degree reckless homicide, first-degree intentional homicide and attempted first-degree intentional homicide. A judge in Lake County held a brief hearing on Friday morning to address Mr. Rittenhouse’s extradition to Wisconsin. At the request of a lawyer for Mr. Rittenhouse, the judge agreed to delay the matter until late September.   Mr. Rittenhouse did not appear during the brief hearing, which took place by video because of the coronavirus pandemic. He is accused in the deaths of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, whose friends said were protesting against the shooting of Mr. Blake by the police in Kenosha on Sunday. He also faces a charge of reckless endangerment in the injury of a third man. Mr. Rittenhouse, who had showed strong support for the police and President Trump on social media, had portrayed himself as a helper to injured people and defender of property when he arrived on the streets of Kenosha during demonstrations earlier this week. But as demonstrators and counterprotesters clashed late Tuesday night, video footage showed Mr. Rittenhouse in the streets of Kenosha, as the situation turned violent. Several people chase him, some shouting, “That’s the shooter!” Even after shots rang out, Mr. Rittenhouse appears to go unnoticed by police officers. In one video, he can be seen, weapon in full view, hands up, walking toward groups of officers — who drive around him as they respond to the confusing scene. Fifty-seven years after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. galvanized the civil rights movement by outlining a dream of racial equality from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, a new group of advocates for racial justice was returning to the same spot on Friday hoping to rekindle some of that passion. This time, the speakers addressed the crowd from an area marked off in grids occupied by small knots of attendees, to limit physical contact and the spread of disease during the coronavirus pandemic. By 9 a.m., the pavement around the Lincoln Memorial was packed with several hundred people. Lakresha Smith, 39, of Columbus, Ohio, was with a group of friends who said they drove six hours to be there. Ms. Smith said the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha had motivated her to take part in a protest for the first time this summer. “I’m here because I have an 18-year-old son, and he needs to know it’s not OK,” she said. Dr. King’s March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom drew an audience of a quarter-million. The Friday protest, called the Commitment March: Get Your Knee Off Our Necks, is expected to attract a small fraction of that, in part because the city is requiring quarantines for visitors from 27 states. Attendees will be required to practice social distancing, wear masks and be screened for fever, and hand-sanitizing stations will be ubiquitous. The organizers, led by the Rev. Al Sharpton and Dr. King’s oldest son, Martin Luther King III, say it would be a mistake to judge the event’s success by the size of its crowd. The march “has to be understood as a moment for which these protests must lead to something,” said Marc Morial, the former New Orleans mayor who is president of the National Urban League, a sponsor of the march. “So it must lead to significant policy change. Structural racism is not addressed with talk or good will alone.” While the protest will commemorate the 1963 march and Dr. King’s iconic “I Have a Dream” address, its larger purpose is to rally African-Americans and others on behalf of concrete goals. They range from increasing voter registration and participation in the 2020 census to enacting a new version of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, said Tylik McMillan, the national director of youth and college at the National Action Network, which Mr. Sharpton founded in 1991.
