Here’s your guide to Day 2. By Maggie Astor As of 9 a.m. Wednesday, eight states that will decide the next president remained uncalled, as did a handful of Senate races that will determine who controls the chamber. Here’s where things stand, when you can expect final results, and how to follow along today as this extraordinary election unfolds. In the presidential race, as of 9 a.m. Eastern time, we did not yet know who won Alaska (3 electoral votes), Arizona (11), Georgia (16), Michigan (16), Nevada (6), North Carolina (15), Pennsylvania (20), Wisconsin (10) or Maine’s Second Congressional District (1). Joseph R. Biden Jr. has 227 confirmed electoral votes and would need 43 more to win. President Trump has 213 confirmed electoral votes and would need 57 more to win. Six Senate races were uncalled in five states: Alaska, Georgia, Maine, Michigan and North Carolina. Georgia has two races, both involving Republican incumbents whom Democrats hope to unseat. One, between Senator David Perdue and Jon Ossoff, might be decided in the next few days or might go to a runoff in January, depending on whether a Libertarian candidate gets enough votes to keep both major-party candidates below 50 percent. The other race will require a runoff between the incumbent, Kelly Loeffler, and Raphael Warnock, a Democrat. This will probably vary significantly from state to state. Let’s take them one at a time.
