By Sarah Bahr Jerry Harris, a fan favorite on the Emmy-nominated Netflix documentary series “Cheer,” was arrested and charged with production of child pornography in a federal court in Chicago on Thursday. Prosecutors said Mr. Harris repeatedly enticed a 13-year-old boy to produce sexually explicit videos and photos of himself and send them to Mr. Harris. In an interview with law enforcement officials on Monday, the complaint says, Mr. Harris, 21, admitted to asking for and receiving child pornography from at least 10 to 15 individuals he knew were minors. He also admitted to having sex with a 15-year-old at a cheerleading event in 2019. A representative for Mr. Harris did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Harris appeared in federal court in Chicago Thursday afternoon. He stood in front of M. David Weisman, a U.S. magistrate judge, in gray pants and a maroon button-down shirt, with his hands clasped behind his back. Mr. Harris responded “yes” when Mr. Weisman asked him if he understood the charge against him. He was also asked if he was taking any controlled substance or prescriptions, to which he responded that he was not.
