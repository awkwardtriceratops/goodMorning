RIGHT NOW Hurricane Zeta is making landfall near Cocodrie, La., and is the fifth named storm to strike the state this year. Hurricane Zeta, a powerful Category 2 storm, made landfall Wednesday afternoon on southeastern Louisiana, where it was expected to bring heavy rains and damaging winds to a state that has been repeatedly clobbered by hurricanes this season. Zeta is the fifth named storm to strike the state this year with about a month left in the hurricane season. The prior record of four was set in 2002, said Philip Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State University. Zeta made landfall near Cocodrie, La., and was about 65 miles south-southwest of New Orleans at 4 p.m. Central time. The storm was moving at 24 miles per hour with maximum sustained winds of 110 miles per hour. Hurricane Zeta is expected to make landfall in the United States Wednesday. A hurricane warning was in effect Wednesday morning for a stretch of coast from Morgan City, La., to the Mississippi-Alabama border and the metropolitan New Orleans area. The storm was expected to make a second landfall along the Mississippi coast on Wednesday evening, then move across the Southeastern and Eastern United States on Thursday, dumping up to six inches of rain in some locations. The city of New Orleans sent regular warnings to residents via text message Wednesday. And officials took a variety of precautions in anticipation of a deluge. The Lower Mississippi River closed to vessels at 2 a.m. Wednesday; the Port of New Orleans was also closed. Flood-protection crews were closing the gates that prevent storm surge from entering the city’s network of drainage canals. City buses stopped running at noon. Since the heavier rains were expected to begin in early afternoon, many offices and stores also shut down at noon. As a result, grocery store checkout lines were lengthy Wednesday morning as people bought bread, canned goods, and meat to put on a gas grill, all of which can be eaten during a power outage. Shoppers also stocked up on bottled water — essential in case the drinking water system loses power. Many residents who live near the Gulf of Mexico in areas unprotected by levees headed to higher ground on Wednesday; other stalwarts who live in raised houses planned to weather the storm within their homes, knowing that the storm surge likely will push several feet of water into their streets and communities before the water recedes on Thursday. On Wednesday morning, as a light rain fell, Ze’ Daluz, 65, stood outside her neighbor’s house in New Orleans’ Ninth Ward discussing what was expected with this fast-moving storm and the city’s drainage system. “We’re supposed to get about four to six inches of rain, but within a few hours, so we know that will overwhelm the pumps. We’ll have street flooding for sure,” Ms. Daluz said. She planned to make a big batch of stewed okra and shrimp on her gas stove, which will work even if power fails.
