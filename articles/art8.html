The action in Warsaw on Friday was expected to be the biggest so far. By Anatol Magdziarz and Marc Santora WARSAW — Ignoring the threat of prosecution and dangers posed by the explosion of coronavirus cases, tens of thousands of women outraged by a court decision to ban nearly all abortions in Poland converged in Warsaw on Friday, expanding what have been the largest demonstrations in the country since the fall of communism in 1989. With a musical medley that included Darth Vader’s theme from Star Wars, in a poke at the government, and techno music blaring over loudspeakers, crowds of women flooded the streets of the capital, many of them with the red lightning bolt that has become the iconic image of the movement emblazoned on their clothes, as the police and military security officers flanked them in every direction. They were joined by thousands of men and a wide array of groups who believe that the hard-won freedoms of the post-communist era are slipping away under the rule of the increasingly autocratic Law and Justice Party. Friday’s march culminated a week of overwhelmingly peaceful protests. The police estimated that 430,000 people attended more than 400 demonstrations around the country on Wednesday. Protests of this scale have not been seen in the country since the Solidarity movement in the 1980s that led to the collapse of the Communist government, according to analysts, a measure of the discontent felt by many Poles over the high court decision on Oct. 22 to virtually ban abortion.
