He is among a number of high-profile Republicans with their eye on the 2024 presidential race with speaking slots this week. On Monday night, speakers produced a long list of misleading, exaggerated and false statements. We also fact-checked the Democratic National Convention last week. A team of New York Times reporters are following the developments and fact-checking the speakers, providing context and explanation. By Nick Corasaniti — Cissie Graham Lynch, a granddaughter of Billy Graham, the founder of Christianity Today While there is plenty of room for subjective judgments about what constitutes religious freedom and there are deep divisions between left and right about how politics should intersect with faith, Mr. Biden is a practicing Catholic. There were opening prayers during the Democratic National Convention. And one of Mr. Biden’s close friends, Senator Chris Coons, offered a lengthy testimony to Mr. Biden’s faith, saying Mr. Biden would be “a president for Americans of all faiths, as well as people of conscience who practice no particular faith.” Ms. Graham Lynch was likely referring to positions Mr. Biden has — such as his support for same-sex marriage or abortion rights — that she personally views as against her faith.   By Rebecca R. Ruiz — Abby Johnson, anti-abortion activist It is true that Mr. Trump has made a huge number of appointments to the bench — 203, including two to the nation’s highest court. And it is true that his appointees have been confirmed with polarizing paper trails, having spent their careers more openly engaged in causes important to Republicans, such as fighting against government funding for abortion, than the appointees of past presidents. But judges do not take the bench as “pro-life” or “pro-choice,” and, upon questioning from senators in confirmation hearings, many of Mr. Trump’s appointees explicitly pledged to apply existing precedent like Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that legalized abortion.
