By David McCabe WASHINGTON — In September, the White House nominated a lawyer to be a commissioner on the Federal Communications Commission. One line on his résumé: aiding the administration’s push to limit an important legal shield for Silicon Valley companies. That same month, the Justice Department sent Congress a detailed proposal for how to change the law behind that legal shield. And on Wednesday, lawmakers will confront the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter. The topic of discussion: whether that law enables bad behavior from the companies. The Trump administration and its allies have fanned out widely in Washington in recent months to attack that law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law is considered sacred by social media platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, because it protects them from liability for content posted by their users. Increasingly, the law is criticized by politicians of both parties. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee for president, has called for it to be revoked, saying it allows the companies to shirk responsibility over what appears on their sites. But President Trump and Republican lawmakers have been increasingly vocal in the months before Election Day, saying the companies have hid behind the law to suppress conservative views. Their frustration flared up again two weeks ago when Twitter and Facebook limited the distribution of an unsubstantiated New York Post article that was critical of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter. Their animosity is likely to be on full display at Wednesday’s hearing, when Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee like Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Ted Cruz of Texas are expected to attack the chief executives. Republicans have invoked the issue as “a cudgel,” said Olivier Sylvain, a law professor at Fordham University who has argued for changes to Section 230. Mr. Trump, he said, is “making a point with his base.” Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said the president had been clear about why the issue was important to address.
