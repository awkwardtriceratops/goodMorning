The experience made Comey sick to his stomach. “I remember the word ‘nauseous,’” Daniels recalled. The two men — Comey, a former F.B.I. director, and Daniels, an Emmy-winning actor — met in Toronto on the set of “The Comey Rule,” a two-part series debuting Sunday on Showtime, based on Comey’s 2018 memoir, “A Higher Loyalty.” Daniels plays Comey. Until then, the real Comey had made himself available by phone and email but stayed otherwise uninvolved. Eventually, though, he found time to spend a day on set. That day’s schedule, by chance, included a recreation of the now-infamous private dinner at which Comey has said that President Trump told him: “I need loyalty. I expect loyalty.” (Trump has disputed this version of events.) Watching Daniels squirm in a replica chair at a replica table in a replica of the White House Green Room opposite Brendan Gleeson’s Trump, Comey began to feel physically ill. That’s how he knew the scene was working. “It was painful for him,” Daniels recalled during a three-way Zoom conversation with Comey earlier this month. Comey, whose only credit on the show is for writing the source material, put it more colorfully. “It freakin’ ruined my day,” he said cheerfully. Written and directed by Billy Ray, a director and screenwriter who specializes in thrillers based on real events (“Shattered Glass,” “Breach”), “The Comey Rule” mixes legal procedural, political suspense and historical drama about a period of history so near and largely unprocessed that watching it can induce a kind of emotional whiplash. Which is to say that Comey may not be alone in feeling sick. The first episode covers the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election and the F.B.I. investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. The second follows the months just after, focused largely on the probe into Russian election meddling and culminating in Comey’s firing. Re-enactments and domestic scenes — Jennifer Ehle plays Comey’s wife, Patrice — offer a sympathetic view of Comey as both public servant and private individual. They reiterate his self-criticism that he can be prideful, overconfident, led by personal ethics at the expense of useful institutional norms. But no scene contradicts or questions the version of events “A Higher Loyalty” supplies. Ray acknowledged that he had approached the project with the belief that Comey’s handling of the Clinton investigation had delivered the election to Trump — “Well, sir,” Ray recalled saying during the initial pitch meeting, “you got him elected.” But the Comey of Part 1 is ultimately a tragic hero, an upright man trapped in a no-win situation. The circumstances of Part 2? Even less winnable. Still the real Comey had one word for his experience watching the series: “Exhausting.” Side by side on Zoom — Comey from Virginia, Daniels from Michigan — Comey and the actor who plays him suggested a compare-and-contrast exercise. (Mostly contrast.) Daniels wore a Philadelphia folk festival T-shirt, his hair every which way, his face relaxing into a frown. Comey, perfectly kempt in a suit jacket and collared shirt, accessorized with a grin. His tidy background — closed blinds, a commendation or two — clashed with Daniels’s cluttered office. On set, a hairpiece, makeup and the occasional voice coach had helped Daniels slip into Comey’s dress shoes. Then again, those shoes had lifts; Comey stands a looming 6-foot-8. “My family believes he captured me in a way,” Comey said. “It was sort of how he held his neck and shoulders.” In conversation, both men projected decency, an Eagle Scout-ness of the soul. Daniels has likability, too, and his recent run of mostly trustworthy heroes — Will McAvoy in “The Newsroom,” Atticus Finch in Broadway’s “To Kill a Mockingbird” — supplies a meta-text that might help viewers invest in a story about a man who managed, in a few short months, to upset both sides of the aisle and probably most independents, too.
