Jemisin and the playwright Larissa FastHorse are among the fellows recognized for their “exceptional creativity” with a no-strings-attached grant of $625,000. By Julia Jacobs When MacArthur called, N. K. Jemisin figured it was spam. She had been getting a lot of those kinds of calls lately — peddling car insurance and such — so she didn’t pick up. It took a text from someone at the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to make her realize that she needed to answer the phone. “I was delighted, excited, shocked, a whole bunch of other adjectives,” Ms. Jemisin, a speculative-fiction writer, said of her reaction after being told that she had been selected for a MacArthur fellowship. Ms. Jemisin is no stranger to receiving major, career-altering awards. In 2016, she became the first African-American woman to win a Hugo Award for best novel (for the first book in her Broken Earth trilogy). Then, in 2018, she became the first author to win a Hugo for every novel in a trilogy. But this award, with its no-strings-attached grant of $625,000, has the potential to fundamentally change her writing process. Ms. Jemisin, 48, said she typically writes under contract, meaning that her books are held to an agreed-upon timeline. But with the financial freedom that the grant offers, she said that she now has the option to forgo those strictures and write on her own schedule. “I will write my books first and sell them as I feel like selling them,” she said. “It presents me with a lot of freedom.” That freedom is particularly tantalizing as Ms. Jemisin writes the second book in her Great Cities series, which imagines her home of New York City as being represented by sentient human avatars. Over the past several months, the upheaval in New York has also upended the plot that she had imagined. (For one, she decided to move up a story point about the New York Police Department “going rogue and attacking the city.”) Ms. Jemisin was announced on Tuesday as one of the 21 MacArthur fellows who are being honored this year for their “exceptional creativity” in a wide range of fields. Known colloquially as the “genius” grant (to the annoyance of the foundation, which sees “genius” as a much different concept than creativity), this year’s fellows include writers, performing artists, scientists and academics. There is a wide range of specialties encompassed in the list. Catherine Coleman Flowers, 62, is an environmental activist focused on bringing attention to inadequate waste and water sanitation infrastructure in rural America. Nels Elde, 47, is an evolutionary geneticist who studies host-pathogen interactions. Jacqueline Woodson, 57, is a writer of children’s and young adult literature that centers on Black families.
