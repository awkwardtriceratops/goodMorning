By Ashley Southall The New York Police Department’s highest-profile Latino official resigned abruptly on Tuesday after complaining to colleagues that Mayor Bill de Blasio had insulted him, two police officials said. The official, Fausto Pichardo, told his superiors and members of his staff that he would retire in November after less than a year as the department’s chief of patrol, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to discuss personnel matters publicly.   Chief Pichardo, 43, could not immediately be reached for comment. A police spokeswoman confirmed in a statement that Chief Pichardo, considered a rising star in the department, planned to retire, but efforts were apparently underway to try to persuade him to change his mind. He visited City Hall on Tuesday, the police officials said. In a statement issued later in the day, Bill Neidhardt, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, said that Chief Pichardo was “a deeply respected leader in the N.Y.P.D. and City Hall is continuing to have conversations with him regarding his future.” His departure comes at a turbulent time for a department that is contending with, among other things, a sharp rise in shootings; cuts to its budget and pressure to rein in some of its tactics; continuing unrest over police brutality; and the enforcement of contentious restrictions in some neighborhoods because of the coronavirus pandemic. Chief Pichardo has played a key role in confronting those and other challenges after Dermot F. Shea, the police commissioner, appointed him last December to lead the Patrol Services Bureau and oversee about 17,000 uniformed officers across the five boroughs. For Chief Pichardo — a product of the city’s public schools who immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic as a child and grew up on Manhattan’s Lower East Side — the promotion was the latest step up the ladder for a 21-year department veteran widely seen as a potential candidate for commissioner one day. It was also reason to celebrate for his fellow Latino officers, a group of whom waved Dominican flags and cheered him on from a balcony at his promotion ceremony. Last week, though, his career took a turn. Chief Pichardo, the two police officials said, was infuriated by an exchange with Mr. de Blasio that came after he had been putting in long hours managing the police response to protests in Orthodox Jewish enclaves in Brooklyn over the pandemic-related restrictions.
