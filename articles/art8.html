By Manny Fernandez, Campbell Robertson, Mitch Smith and Will Wright What started as a Midwestern surge has grown into coast-to-coast disaster. Over the last two months, rural counties and midsize cities in the Great Plains and Upper Midwest have been the main drivers of the dizzying growth in coronavirus cases in the United States. But the virus appears to have entered a new phase in recent days: The reason the country is continuing to break case records has less to do with North Dakota and Wisconsin than it does with swift resurgences of the virus in cities like Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami and Phoenix and with first-time spikes in smaller cities away from the nation’s middle, like Cumberland, Md. “Our people are tired,” said Maggie Hansen, the chief nursing executive at Memorial Healthcare System in South Florida. “They’re tired and they don’t see an end in sight.” Seeking to rally the nation on the eve of Thanksgiving, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. offered words of encouragement, saying “there’s real hope, tangible hope” in the face of the virus. He urged Americans to wear face masks and practice social distancing, and to “hang on” as they faced a long, hard winter. “Looking back over our history, you see that it’s been in the most difficult circumstances that the soul of our nation has been forged,” Mr. Biden said. In language that served as an implicit repudiation of President Trump, he urged Americans to come together to fight the virus. “I know the country has grown weary of the fight,” Mr. Biden said. “We need to remember we’re at war with the virus, not with one another, not with each other.” Coronavirus cases are emerging in their highest numbers of the pandemic, with more than 175,000 a day, on average, in a country that has seen more cases and more deaths than anywhere else in the world. More than 1.2 million cases have been identified in the United States in the last week alone, and the country is on pace to reach 13 million known cases in the coming days. Deaths are also rising fast, with more than 2,200 announced nationwide on Tuesday, the most on a single day since early May. The spread of the virus rages on in the Great Plains and the Upper Midwest. Iowa and South Dakota continue to report new cases at some of the highest rates in the country, and deaths there have reached their highest levels on record. But the pace of the spread has slowed in those regions while rapidly increasing in other, more populous parts of the country, including in California, where more than 17,000 cases were announced on Monday, and in Texas, where more than 20,000 cases were announced on Tuesday, the two highest daily totals of any state during the pandemic. All of this has been unfolding on the eve of what infectious-disease experts see as a likely turning point for the outbreak in this country. Dr. Eli Perencevich, an infectious-disease physician and epidemiologist at the University of Iowa, said he feared the worst was still yet to come in his state, especially with Thanksgiving gatherings and cold weather looming.
