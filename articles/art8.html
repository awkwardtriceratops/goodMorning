Moped Service With Stricter Rules<br></h1><p id="artcont">The shared moped company is returning to New York City, its biggest market, and will now be quizzing riders and requiring helmet selfies. By Dana Rubinstein Immediate suspension for riding in the wrong direction down a one-way street. A 21-question test on which a rider must achieve a perfect score, twice. Photographic evidence of wearing a helmet. These are the new rules that will govern who can ride Revel mopeds in New York City, after two rider deaths in July prompted the company to temporarily suspend service. A third rider, who was injured in July before the suspension, died in August. On Thursday morning, Revel, a shareable electric moped company, will return to New York City, its biggest market. Over the next few weeks, the company will return 3,000 mopeds to city streets with a renewed, regulator-friendly emphasis on safety. “There’s no more excuses anymore, like, ‘Oh, you mean that you have to stop at the stoplight?’ Yes, you do,” said Frank Reig, 34, the company’s co-founder and chief executive. “And if you don’t, we’re going to have a pretty strict policy of taking you off the service.” After negotiations with city officials, Revel has agreed to continue to suspend service from midnight to 5 a.m. for at least 60 days. When riders open the app on Thursday morning, they will be greeted with a mandatory, 21-question test that includes queries like “Who can I share my account with?” (correct answer: nobody) and “How will your Revel membership be affected if you drive a Revel without wearing a helmet?” (answer: A seven-day suspension upon first offense). Riders will also have to watch a three-minute training video featuring a “lesson specialist” named Brandon, who quickly demonstrates how to use turn signals, honk the horn, accelerate, brake and access the free helmets in the box behind the moped seat. Because Revel mopeds do not exceed 30 miles per hour, the state does not require users to have a motorcycle license. But operation of the mopeds is not always immediately intuitive to those more familiar with cars and bikes, and 17 percent of Revel crashes in 2020 occurred on the user’s first ride, according to New York City statistics. The crash rate for all riders rose by 59 percent in the overnight hours. Riders were not wearing helmets in three of the five most serious Revel crashes since May, including two of the July incidents that led to fatalities, according to the city. The authorities say all three people who died appeared to have lost control of the moped. In lawsuits, plaintiffs have alleged other issues with Revel, including a lack of adequate instruction and maintenance problems.
