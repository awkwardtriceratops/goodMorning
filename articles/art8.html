He had hoped that her presidential bid would be an opportunity for the country to grapple with the injustice of mass incarceration in a thoughtful way. Instead, he explained, the basic fact of her profession as a prosecutor was used by many as an indictment against her. On today’s “Sunday Read,” listen to Mr. Betts’s exploration of his experiences with the criminal justice system, his thoughts on Kamala Harris and the conversations that America needs to have about mass incarceration.
