Mr. Johnson, 48, said they had become infected around two and a half weeks ago, from “very close family friends.” He called it “one of the most challenging and difficult things we have ever had to endure as a family,” but added that he and his family were now “on the other end of it” and were healthy and no longer contagious. While the symptoms were mild for his youngest daughters, Jasmine and Tiana, Mr. Johnson said he and his wife had a “rough go” with the virus. Mr. Johnson also urged people to wear masks. “It baffles me that some people out there — including some politicians — will take this idea of wearing masks and make it part of a political agenda,” he said. “It has nothing to do with politics,” he said. “Wear your mask.” Mr. Johnson added that his mother, who had part of her lungs removed before recovering from lung cancer, still wears a mask “every day.” His announcement comes as coronavirus cases increase around the world, with over 26 million people infected and at least 862,000 dead from the virus, according to a New York Times database. In the United States, at least 1,074 deaths and over 40,000 new cases were reported on Wednesday, when Mr. Johnson posted to Instagram about his experience with Covid-19. While Mr. Johnson said he and his family still trust the friends from whom they contracted the coronavirus, he advised people to take all precautions before seeing others. “Think twice about who you have over to your house,” he said. Mr. Johnson joins a long list of celebrities, athletes and public figures who have contracted the virus and called on the public to treat it seriously by wearing masks, social distancing and taking other precautions. The list includes Hollywood stars like Tom Hanks and his wife, the actress Rita Wilson; athletes like the basketball players Kevin Durant and Rudy Gobert; and world leaders such as Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
