Pitcher Suspected of Killing Ex-Girlfriend Is Found Dead<br></h1><p id="artcont">The authorities said they had been looking for Charles Haeger since Friday, when his former girlfriend was fatally shot in her home in Scottsdale, Ariz. By Johnny Diaz A former major league pitcher was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was identified by the authorities as a suspect in the killing of his former girlfriend in Arizona, the authorities said. The police found the body of the retired pitcher, Charles Haeger, about 4 p.m. local time on Saturday along a trail at the South Rim of the Grand Canyon in Northern Arizona, Sgt. Ben Hoster of the Scottsdale Police Department said in a statement. Mr. Haeger’s unoccupied minivan had been found that morning near Flagstaff, Sergeant Hoster said. The police had been looking for Mr. Haeger, 37, since Friday in connection with the fatal shooting of his former girlfriend, whom the authorities identified as Danielle Breed, 34. On Friday afternoon, Ms. Breed’s roommate had returned to their residence in Scottsdale, just east of Phoenix, when “he heard multiple gunshots coming from her room,” Sergeant Hoster said. Moments later, Mr. Haeger came out of her room with a handgun, Sergeant Hoster said. “Haeger then pointed the handgun at the roommate,” Sergeant Hoster said. “The roommate quickly escaped out of the back of the residence, and he was able to get a neighbor to call 911.” Police officers who responded to “sounds of shots” called the S.W.A.T. team, believing the shooter may still be inside, Sergeant Hoster said. Officers later found Ms. Breed dead inside the home. The authorities asked for the public’s help in locating Mr. Haeger, whom they described as “armed and dangerous.”
