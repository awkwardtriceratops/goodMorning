By Benjamin Weiser, Alan Feuer and Amy Julia Harris For years, Ghislaine Maxwell has been a central but silent figure in a scandal involving Jeffrey Epstein’s long history of abusing teenage girls. On Thursday, however, Ms. Maxwell’s voice was heard for the first time as a four-year-old deposition was released containing her response to the swirl of claims surrounding Mr. Epstein: a series of evasions and denials. Stubborn and elusive by turns, Ms. Maxwell, 58, rejected almost every allegation of wrongdoing in the 465-page document, denying that she helped Mr. Epstein recruit, groom and ultimately sexually mistreat dozens of teenage girls and young women. At one point, she was asked 10 times in a row if she believed Mr. Epstein had abused any minors — and each time ducked the question. The transcript, from 2016, was part of a defamation lawsuit filed in Manhattan. She also denied that she herself had ever had any form of inappropriate sex. “I just testified,” she said, “I never had nonconsensual sex with anybody ever, at any time, at anyplace, at any time, with anybody.” Ms. Maxwell, Mr. Epstein’s former romantic partner, became the focus of a federal investigation into his sex-trafficking network after his suicide in jail last year. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have charged her with conspiring with Mr. Epstein, a financier, in his abuse of minors. As his closest associate, she is believed to have extensive information about him and others who might have been involved. But her deposition left unanswered the question of who that might be: Nearly all of the names contained within it — except her own and Mr. Epstein's — were redacted. Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While the deposition is rife with denials about various forms of sexual activity — including one involving a laundry basket of sex toys — Ms. Maxwell does explain that she performed several jobs for Mr. Epstein at his properties in New York and Florida. She said she was in charge of hiring his pool attendants, gardeners, chefs, butlers, housekeepers and chauffeurs. All of them, she added, were “age appropriate adult people.” The deposition also provides a glimpse into how Mr. Epstein financially supported Ms. Maxwell over the years. She said he lent her money to buy a townhouse and bought a car for her — though she acknowledged that she could not recall the make or model. She also said Mr. Epstein donated $50,000 to TerraMar, an ocean conservation charity she founded. Ms. Maxwell further noted that Mr. Epstein liked to have at least one massage a day and that more than one masseuse would be on call to perform them. But she refused to answer questions about whether the word “massage” was a code word for sex, saying only that they involved “private adult sexual relationships.”
