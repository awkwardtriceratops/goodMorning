By Curtis Rush TORONTO — Game 7s have a magic all their own. They are where memories are made, bringing out the kid in every N.H.L. player who dared to dream about a winner-take-all moment. “When you do everything as a young kid, playing on the streets, you’re playing Game 7,” Islanders Coach Barry Trotz said before his team shut out the Philadelphia Flyers, 4-0, on Saturday, advancing to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 27 years. “There’s going to be a hero tonight, no question.” The hero was defenseman Scott Mayfield, along with the entire Islanders defense, which accounted for two goals and limited the Flyers to 16 shots on goal. The Islanders’ first two goals took the starch out of the Flyers, who had fought gamely to overcome a three-games-to-one series deficit and force Game 7. The backup goaltender Thomas Greiss also made a heroic stand. He is the second goaltender in franchise history to record a shutout in a Game 7. Glenn Resch did so in the 1975 quarterfinals against the Pittsburgh Penguins. With 6 minutes 55 seconds to go in regulation, the Flyers lifted goalie Carter Hart for an extra attacker, opening the way for the Islanders’ Anthony Beauvillier to score in an empty net. The Islanders will meet the Tampa Bay Lightning in a best-of-seven series that starts Monday in Edmonton, Alberta. Mayfield and the 37-year-old defenseman Andy Greene put the Islanders up, 2-0, and forward Brock Nelson gave the Islanders a three-goal cushion going into the third period. “Guys work their whole life to get this opportunity,’’ Nelson said after the game. “The fan base is passionate and always talks about the wins in the 80s and the guys that won Cups there. And you can see how much it means to them and the community. Those guys are heroes and everybody in the room is striving to be part of history like that.” Mayfield’s first-period goal, on only the Islanders’ second shot of the game, was his first career postseason goal in his 26th game. It was also redemption for his bad luck in Game 6, in which the Flyers scored the double-overtime winner after Mayfield was left defenseless in his own end without a stick, which had broken moments before. The decision to start Greiss was a calculated risk for Trotz because Greiss had seen action only twice before this postseason. But he had been solid in one relief effort in Game 2 of the second-round series and again in a Game 4 victory. The Islanders needed someone to be as dependable as the Flyers’ Carter Hart had been at the other end. The Islanders had lost two straight overtime games, squandering a three-games-to-one series lead, and Semyon Varlamov had allowed five goals on only 31 shots in Game 6 for a substandard .839 save percentage.
