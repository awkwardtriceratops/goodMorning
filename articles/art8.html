From 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time, Michael Barbaro, host of our morning podcast, The Daily, and Carolyn Ryan, a deputy managing editor for The Times, will be calling reporters across the nation to get the latest updates on a history-making day. Over our four-hour broadcast, we will speak with dozens of Times reporters and editors across the United States. Our political correspondents will share what’s happening inside the campaigns, our national reporters will be on the ground in key battleground states, our technology reporters will keep an eye on social media — and potential disinformation — and our polling experts will discuss the state of the race. Here are some of the people you can expect to hear from during our broadcast: Dean Baquet, executive editor for The Times, will talk about how we are reporting on the race. Maggie Haberman, a White House correspondent, will report on what is happening inside President Trump’s inner circle today. Talk to Maggie: @maggieNYT Astead W.
