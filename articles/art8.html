By Remy Tumin and Karen Cetinkaya (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The stakes have never been higher for a vice-presidential debate. Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris are facing off in their first and only debate tonight. The coronavirus pandemic will most likely shape the topics, including President Trump’s recent hospitalization with the disease and Mr. Pence’s role as the head of the now largely defunct White House task force. The Times is streaming the debate, moderated by Susan Page of USA Today, with real-time analysis and fact-checking from our reporters. For Ms. Harris, the debate will bring its own challenges and traps. Here’s what else to watch for. The candidates will be seated 12 feet apart at desks, and divided by plexiglass barriers. But adding a box fan, an air filter and duct tape to attach them would be an even safer option, according to some public health experts. 2. President Trump called his coronavirus infection “a blessing from God” in a new video posted on Twitter. More than 211,400 Americans have died from disease. In a wide-ranging speech, Mr. Trump told the nation he would also provide hundreds of thousands of doses of unapproved drugs to Americans free of charge. He returned to the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon despite his infection. Advisers were exploring the idea of resuming travel events for Mr. Trump next week, two people close to the White House said. His doctor said he is symptom-free and feeling “great,” but offered no further details about Mr. Trump’s treatment. For someone who isn’t president, his treatment would cost more than $100,000 in the American health system. Our Congressional reporters also looked at the president’s abrupt withdrawal from stimulus negotiations, and said it is remarkably perilous. The politics of a bipartisan deal were always tricky, but the president’s move to upend talks a month before Election Day removed any ambiguity about who was responsible for the lack of an aid bill, they write in an analysis. 3. Joe Biden is maintaining a steady lead over President Trump in Nevada and the candidates are virtually tied in Ohio, according to new Times/Siena College polls.
