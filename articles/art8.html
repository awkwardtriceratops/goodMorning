He is among a number of high-profile Republicans with their eye on the 2024 presidential race with speaking slots this week. On Monday night, speakers produced a long list of misleading, exaggerated and false statements. We also fact-checked the Democratic National Convention last week. A team of New York Times reporters are following the developments and fact-checking the speakers, providing context and explanation. By Nick Corasaniti — Cissie Graham Lynch, a granddaughter of Billy Graham, the founder of Christianity Today While there is plenty of room for subjective judgments about what constitutes religious freedom and there are deep divisions between left and right about how politics should intersect with faith, Mr. Biden is a practicing Catholic. There were opening prayers during the Democratic National Convention. And one of Mr. Biden’s close friends, Senator Chris Coons, offered a lengthy testimony to Mr. Biden’s faith, saying Mr. Biden would be “a president for Americans of all faiths, as well as people of conscience who practice no particular faith.” Ms. Graham Lynch was likely referring to positions Mr. Biden has — such as his support for same-sex marriage or abortion rights — that she personally views as against her faith.   By Rebecca R. Ruiz — Abby Johnson, anti-abortion activist It is true that Mr. Trump has made a huge number of appointments to the bench — 203, including two to the nation’s highest court. And it is true that his appointees have been confirmed with polarizing paper trails, having spent their careers more openly engaged in causes important to Republicans, such as fighting against government funding for abortion, than the appointees of past presidents. But judges do not take the bench as “pro-life” or “pro-choice,” and, upon questioning from senators in confirmation hearings, many of Mr. Trump’s appointees explicitly pledged to apply existing precedent like Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that legalized abortion. By Coral Davenport — Larry Kudlow, Trump economic adviser. A Biden administration is expected to reinstate many of the roughly 100 environmental regulations that have been rolled back or weakened by the Trump administration. But in fact, United States oil and gas have both been increasing at a steady rate since about 2009. And while Mr. Trump ran on the promise of restoring the U.S. coal industry, domestic coal production in 2019 fell to its lowest level since 1978. By Jeanna Smialek — Larry Kudlow, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow tried to paint the economy President Trump inherited as “stagnant,” even on the edge of recession, and said that Mr. Trump had turned it around. That is not true. There were plenty of positive things about the pre-pandemic economy — unemployment was at its lowest level in 50 years, wages were gradually rising, and the economic expansion was at record-length. But those trends were a continuation of what was already happening under President Barack Obama. Gains in employment, for instance, actually slowed slightly after Mr. Trump took office compared to late in Mr. Obama’s term, simply because he inherited an economy in the later stages of a long-running expansion and there were fewer workers left on the job market’s sidelines. It’s also wrong to imply that Mr. Trump pumped up growth in the economy overall. Gross domestic product continued to expand at a fairly steady, little changed pace under Mr. Trump’s watch. By Rebecca R. Ruiz — Cissie Graham Lynch, a granddaughter of Billy Graham, the founder of Christianity Today The Obama administration sought to guarantee access to free birth control for women, and while some groups, including an order of Catholic nuns, have fought that mandate and argued that contraception is tantamount to abortion, scientists have disputed that characterization. It is true that Democrats have argued against religion-based adoption agencies’ ability to refuse to place children in L.G.B.T.Q. homes, as in Michigan, where the state’s attorney general Dana Nessel has called such a refusal of same-sex couples illegal discrimination. The Obama administration established protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. And it is true that Democrats, such as California’s former governor Jerry Brown, have allowed transgender students to choose whether to play on a boys’ or girls’ sports team, and which bathroom or locker room to use, and that the Trump administration has rescinded such protections at the federal level in a rejection of Obama administration guidance. By Ana Swanson — John Peterson, owner of Schuette Metals, a second-generation metal fabrication business The United States Mexico Canada Agreement did replace the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. But while the 2,082-page pact includes some important changes in key areas — like incentives to make cars in North America and reforms to Mexican labor rules — it’s also fair to describe it as an update of the original NAFTA pact. Much of the new agreement simply updates the pre-existing deal with new laws on the internet, intellectual property protection, state-owned enterprises and currency. By Abby Goodnough — Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky The Trump administration did issue a rule in 2018 allowing small businesses and self-employed people in the same industry, state or region to band together and obtain health insurance as if they were a single large employer. Mr. Trump promoted the plans, long a goal of Republicans in Congress, as a way to save people from the “nightmare of Obamacare.” But last year, a Federal District Court judge in the District of Columbia struck down the rule allowing association health plans, calling them “clearly an end-run around the A.C.A.” The Trump administration appealed and is still waiting for a decision. Association health plans are controversial because they are exempt from many consumer-protection mandates in the Affordable Care Act, like the requirement to provide “essential health benefits,” such as mental health care, emergency services, maternity care, and prescription drugs. Mr. Trump hoped the plans would appeal to middle-class people who found plans through the Affordable Care Act too expensive because their income was too high to qualify for the law’s premium subsidies or discounted deductibles. Critics worried they would destabilize the Affordable Care Act marketplaces by drawing healthy customers away, but there is not abundant evidence that has happened. By Linda Qiu — Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky Mr. Biden did vote for the Iraq War but Mr. Paul is overstating the timeline of Mr. Trump’s opposition. Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly and falsely claimed to have opposed the Iraq war from the beginning. In 2002, asked if he supported an invasion, Mr. Trump responded, “Yeah, I guess so.” Mr. Trump spoke out against the war in 2004, a year after it began. It did not stop him from supporting President George W. Bush in the 2004 election. Mr. Biden called his vote for the war a mistake in 2005. By Ana Swanson — Cris Peterson, dairy farmer. The strength of the American economy in 2018 may have helped farms like Ms. Peterson’s, but the dairy industry in the United States is still struggling, despite hefty subsidies and support from the Trump administration. Earlier this year, the United States Department of Agriculture said that it had recorded the largest annual decline in the number of licensed dairy operations since 2014. Dairy farmers have also been hard hit by the pandemic, which has shut down restaurants, schools and other major buyers and forced some farmers to dump milk in their fields. By Ana Swanson — Jason Joyce, a lobster fisherman from Maine The United States and the European Union announced a small agreement on Friday that eliminated tariffs on a few products — including American lobster, European glass crystal and cigarette lighters — following a meeting between President Trump and Maine lobsterman in June, where the president said he would press Europe to lower that tariff. It’s also true that Mr. Trump has been under pressure to help struggling American lobstermen in part because of his own trade policies. American lobsterman had been put at a disadvantage to their Canadian competitors when selling into the European market after Canada and the E.U. signed a trade agreement that cut barriers between the countries in 2016. China also imposed retaliatory tariffs on American lobster as a result of the trade war, further harming the industry. By Eric Schmitt — Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky As a senator, Mr. Biden supported the 1999 NATO air campaign against Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader accused of ethnic cleansing. As vice president, Mr. Biden supported the campaign to oust the Islamic State from Syria in 2014, but he warned against intervening in Libya in 2011 to topple the country’s strongman ruler, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to end wars in the Middle East and Southwest Asia but has yet to fulfill this promise. In February, the United States signed a deal with the Taliban laying out a timetable for the final withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan within 12 to 14 months if the insurgent group met certain conditions. In recent months, Mr. Trump has repeatedly voiced a desire to leave Afghanistan sooner than that. A few weeks ago, Mr. Trump said there would be fewer than 5,000 American troops in Afghanistan by Election Day in November. There are currently about 8,600 U.S. forces in the country. In December 2018, Mr. Trump ordered the withdrawal of 2,000 American troops from Syria. Roughly 1,000 remained by October 2019, when Mr. Trump ordered withdrawal again. A February report from the Defense Department’s inspector general estimated that 500 troops remained in northeastern Syria and an additional 100 were stationed at a desert outpost in the country’s southeast. There are currently about 5,200 American troops in Iraq — about level with the 5,262 reported at the end of 2016. Though there are plans to reduce the number to as few as 2,500, there are no fixed timetables or numbers. By Coral Davenport — Jason Joyce, the lobster fisherman Among President Barack Obama’s last acts as President was the creation of the Atlantic Ocean’s first national marine monument, banning oil and gas drilling and commercial fishing in an area roughly the size of Connecticut about 130 miles off the coast of Cape Cod. The creation of the monument was designed to protect endangered whales and turtles, ancient deep-sea coral and species of fish unique to the region, but commercial fishermen fiercely opposed it. Mr. Trump rolled back the monument designation earlier this year, but the reversal is unlikely to help lobstermen, since the area in question lies over 100 miles offshore, while most lobster fishing takes place about three miles offshore. Mr. Obama also carved out a seven-year exception for lobster and red crab fisheries so the creation of the monument has had little impact on Maine’s lobster landings. By Mark Walker — Myron Lizer, the Vice President of the Navajo Nation In 2013, President Barack Obama signed into law the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. The act strengthened the Violence Against Women Act with increased protections for Native American women. Years earlier, in 2010, Mr. Obama signed the Tribal Law and Order Act, which provided for enhanced sentencing by tribal courts. At the time he said, the prevalence of violence against Native American women remains “an assault on our national conscience” that “we cannot allow to continue.” The Violence Against Women Act, first negotiated by Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., lapsed during the government shutdown in December 2018. By Emily Cochrane — Myron Lizner, vice president of the Navajo Nation While the $8 billion allocated to tribes in the $2.2 trillion stimulus law is considered the largest single sum of aid ever set aside for tribes, Democrats were the primary advocates for providing relief directly to tribes. The original Republican legislation did not include any funding for tribes, and tribal leaders have said that much more support is needed. It also took months for the aid to reach tribes because federal agencies were largely unaccustomed to dealing with sovereign nations, tribal leaders said, A significant portion of the aid was also tied up in court as tribes questioned how the administration chose to divide the funds across the country, complicating efforts to distribute the money. A federal watchdog is investigating whether a top Interior Department official violated ethics rules when she helped decide how to divide the funds. Tonight’s speakers include Melania Trump, the first lady, and Mike Pompeo, the first sitting secretary of state in at least 75 years to address a national party convention. Follow our live updates.
