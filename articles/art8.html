By Adam Liptak WASHINGTON — At least five Supreme Court justices, including two members of its conservative majority, indicated on Tuesday that they would reject attempts by Republicans and the Trump administration to kill the Affordable Care Act. It was not clear whether the court would strike down a provision of the act that initially required most Americans to obtain insurance or pay a penalty, a requirement that was rendered toothless in 2017 after Congress zeroed out the penalty. But the bulk of the sprawling 2010 health care law, President Barack Obama’s defining domestic legacy, appeared likely to survive its latest encounter with the court. Both Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said striking down the so-called individual mandate did not require the rest of the law to be struck down as well. “Congress left the rest of the law intact when it lowered the penalty to zero,” Chief Justice Roberts said. Justice Kavanaugh made a similar point. “It does seem fairly clear that the proper remedy would be to sever the mandate provision and leave the rest of the act in place — the provisions regarding pre-existing conditions and the rest,” he said. The court’s three-member liberal wing — Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — also indicated their support for the law. That suggested there were at least five votes to uphold almost all of it. Three members of the court’s conservative majority, Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch, seemed poised to vote to strike down the law. The court’s newest member, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, was harder to read, though she has been publicly critical of earlier rulings sustaining key provisions of the law. Striking down the Affordable Care Act would expand the ranks of the uninsured in the United States by about 21.1 million people — a nearly 70 percent increase — according to new estimates from the Urban Institute. The biggest loss of coverage would be among low-income adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the law after all but a dozen states expanded the program to include them. But millions of Americans would also lose private insurance, including young adults whom the law allowed to stay on their parents’ plans until they turned 26 and families whose income was modest enough to qualify for subsidies that help pay their monthly premiums. In the decade since the enactment of the health care law, Republicans have worked hard to destroy it, and President Trump has repeatedly criticized it. But attempts to repeal it failed, as did two earlier Supreme Court challenges, in 2012 and 2015. With the passing years, the law has gained in popularity and been woven into the fabric of the health care system in ways big and small. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. vowed Tuesday to preserve and expand the law when he takes office on Jan. 20, and he assailed the arguments made in court by lawyers for Republican officials and the Trump administration. Mr. Biden lashed out at what he called “far-right ideologues” in the administration who had asked the court to strike down the law, saying the impact of such a move for millions of Americans would be severe. Campaigning for president, Mr. Biden said he wanted to strengthen the law by offering a public option that allows people to receive coverage the way Medicare enrollees do, through a system of government-run insurance. People who would prefer to stay on private insurance would be able to do so. The new case, California v. Texas, No. 19-840, was brought by Republican officials who said the mandate requiring insurance became unconstitutional after Congress in 2017 eliminated the penalty for failing to obtain health insurance because it could no longer be justified as a tax. They went on to argue that the mandate was a crucial feature of the law, and so the entire law should be thrown out. The challenge has largely succeeded in the lower courts. A federal judge in Texas ruled that the entire law was invalid, but he postponed the effects of his ruling until the case could be appealed. In December, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, agreed that the mandate was unconstitutional but declined to rule on the fate of the remainder of the health law, asking the lower court to reconsider the question in more detail. Officials in states led by Democrats instead asked the Supreme Court to hear the case, saying the justices should act to resolve the uncertainty created by the appeals court’s ruling. The law includes popular provisions on guaranteed coverage for pre-existing medical conditions, emergency care, prescription drugs and maternity care. A lawyer for Texas and other Republican-led states, supported by a lawyer for the Trump administration, argued that all of those provisions should be ended as a consequence of the 2017 change to the individual mandate. Those arguments were largely based on a decision in an earlier Supreme Court case, in 2012, when the court upheld the law’s requirement that most Americans obtain insurance or pay a penalty. The vote was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice Roberts writing the controlling opinion, which said the mandate was authorized by Congress’s power to assess taxes. He was joined by what was at the time the court’s four-member liberal wing. Since the mandate no longer raises revenue, said Kyle D. Hawkins, Texas’s solicitor general, it cannot be justified as a tax and was therefore unconstitutional. In assessing the narrow question of the constitutionality of the revised mandate, the justices discussed hypothetical laws that merely urged people to do things without penalizing them if they disobeyed. Michael J. Mongan, California’s solicitor general, said that without penalties for noncompliance, such laws present no constitutional problems. As for the revised mandate, he said, “it doesn’t require anybody to do anything.” At Justice Barrett’s confirmation hearings last month, Democratic senators questioned her closely about critical statements she had made about the two major Supreme Court decisions sustaining the law. At Tuesday’s argument, she questioned the constitutionality of the mandate. “Why can’t we say that when Congress zeroed out the tax, it was no longer a tax because it generated no revenue and, therefore, it could no longer be justified as a taxing power?” she asked. But Justice Barrett did not tip her hand on the more important issue of whether the rest of the law should survive if the mandate is struck down. Justice Kagan noted what she said was a curious features of the challengers’ argument. In 2012, she said, the Supreme Court had ruled that the mandate backed by a penalty was not an unconstitutional command. In 2017, she said, the law became less coercive. “How does it make sense to say that what was not an unconstitutional command before has become an unconstitutional command now, given the far lesser degree of coercive force?” she asked. Chief Justice Roberts noted that the mandate had in the earlier case been said to be “the key to the whole act.” Justice Thomas said the court had been told that “this provision was the heart and soul of the Affordable Care Act.” Indeed, when the earlier challenge to the health care law was argued in 2012, the Obama administration did say that the mandate could not be severed from two related provisions, one prohibiting insurers from turning away applicants and the other barring them from taking account of pre-existing conditions.
