Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Wednesday. Weather: Nice and sunny. High around 70. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Nov. 1 (All Saints Day). For many New York City parents, the choice between in-person classes or remote learning wasn’t just about their child’s education. Parents like Margaret Li, of Queens, worried: If she sent her sons back to school, would that put her 68-year-old mother at risk of infection? Since the summer, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s biggest goal was returning New York City’s students to its public schools after the city significantly reduced its coronavirus infection rates. Despite pushback from principals who complained of staff shortages, and despite delays to the start of the school year and concerns about the virus spreading in classrooms, some students went back to in-person classes. But in District 26, a largely immigrant school district in northeastern Queens, the parents of two out of three students stuck with remote learning. “While kids are safe, my mom is safe too,” Ms. Li told my colleague Juliana Kim. “Her health is most important to our family.” [Some worried parents are choosing all-remote instruction for their children.] Half of the district’s population is Asian-American, and seven out of 10 of the city’s Asian-American students opted out of in-person classes. The data is similar for Black and Latino students, as more than half chose all-remote learning after their communities were disproportionately affected by the virus. Several families who spoke to Ms. Kim said they live with older relatives and fear that their children would bring the virus home from school. Parents also said remote learning schedules are more predictable, especially after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo abruptly closed schools in parts of Brooklyn and Queens where virus positivity rates were high. According to city data, there’s no evidence to suggest that the reopening of schools has contributed to the spread of the virus. Out of about 1,700 students and adults from city schools who were tested for the virus on Friday, only one person was positive, the mayor said at a news conference Tuesday. “We brought back the nation’s largest school system,” he said. “It was not easy, but we’ve done it.”
