By Sopan Deb The splashy, surprising hire of Steve Nash as the Nets’ head coach is sure to galvanize the team’s fan base, with a roster headlined by Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving primed to immediately compete for a championship. However, Nash’s hire brought back into focus the ongoing discussion about how few nonwhite coaches are in the N.B.A., a league where about 80 percent of the players are Black. Nash, who has no coaching experience — even as an assistant — is white. Jacque Vaughn, who had been the Nets’ interim coach since March, is Black and had kept the team unexpectedly competitive in its 12 games in the N.B.A.’s so-called bubble in Florida, despite losing players to injuries and coronavirus infections. Vaughn was asked to stay on as the team’s lead assistant. Before Vaughn was promoted to the interim head coaching role, he had been an assistant on the Nets since 2016 and had been one under Gregg Popovich in San Antonio. He had also been a head coach for 2 ½ seasons in Orlando, where he went just 58-158. Nash’s résumé is based almost entirely on his playing career: Over nearly two decades, he became one of the greatest point guards ever, a two-time most valuable player and Hall of Famer known for dishing flashy passes and being at the forefront of the game’s evolution from one favoring centers and post play to the one featuring mobility and 3-pointers that fans see today. As of Thursday, seven of the 30 N.B.A. head coaches were people of color. Five of them are Black. One, James Borrego of the Charlotte Hornets, is Hispanic, and Erik Spoelstra, the coach of the Miami Heat, is of Filipino descent. Four teams have coaching vacancies: Indiana, Philadelphia, Chicago and New Orleans. “The N.B.A. and its teams are committed to advancing diversity, including the representation of Black executives and employees,” Mike Bass, an N.B.A. spokesman, said in a statement. He added, “We continue working hard across the board to interrupt bias in our decision-making at every level by continuing to strengthen processes, expand programming and increase accountability, and we expect to be judged over time on our progress and the totality of our results.” Three Black head coaches were dismissed from their jobs in the last year: David Fizdale of the Knicks was fired in December and replaced in July by Tom Thibodeau, who is white; Nate McMillan was fired by the Pacers on Aug. 26, weeks after signing an extension; and Alvin Gentry was let go by New Orleans on Aug. 15 after the regular season ended. A representative for the National Basketball Coaches Association declined to comment. The players’ union did not respond to a request for comment. The N.B.A.’s lack of diversity in some areas has not gone unnoticed. In June, the N.B.A. and its players’ union released a statement that said “strategies to increase Black representation across the N.B.A. and its teams” had come up in their discussions about social justice. After the statement was released, Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters: “There is no doubt there is more we can do internally, the league and our teams and in terms of our hiring practices. The league needs to do a good job, in particular, when it comes to hiring African-Americans at every level in the league.” In July, the N.B.A. named its first-ever “chief people and inclusion officer” — Oris Stuart, who was already leading the league's diversity efforts — aimed at codifying policies to hire more people of color in and around the league. And there has been some progress: This summer, three teams hired Black executives to be their general managers: Troy Weaver in Detroit; Marc Eversley in Chicago and Calvin Booth in Denver. According to the most recent report from The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, the N.B.A. league office’s staff with 39.4 percent people of color outpaces other sports leagues. After the three G.M. hirings, there are now 10 nonwhite general managers in the league.
