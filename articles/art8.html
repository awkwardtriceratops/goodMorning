It was Nadal’s 13th title at the French Open. By Christopher Clarey Neither Novak Djokovic nor Roger Federer could resist Rafael Nadal on Sunday. Nadal made astonishingly quick work of them both in the French Open final, overwhelming Djokovic, the world’s No. 1 player, 6-0, 6-2, 7-5, to equal Federer’s record of 20 Grand Slam singles titles. It was quite possibly Nadal’s finest performance at Roland Garros, which sounds like a reach considering that he had already won 12 Grand Slam singles title on the same rectangle of red clay. But there was nothing unlucky about No. 13. He was on target from the opening game, breaking Djokovic’s serve under the closed roof at the Philippe Chatrier Court. Nadal, 34 years old but still an irresistible force, ripped groundstrokes with depth and purpose, hunted down drop shots, read Djokovic’s mind and serve and kept his unforced errors to a strict minimum. He made just two in the opening set — one of those on the opening point — and 14 in the match, giving his more erratic and increasingly edgy rival little time or space to find his mojo. Djokovic, the 2016 French Open champion, is one of only two men to beat Nadal at Roland Garros. He had defeated Nadal in their last three Grand Slam matches against each other. The most recent of those came at the 2019 Australian Open final, where Djokovic overwhelmed Nadal, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3, in what Djokovic still maintains was the finest performance of his career. But that rout took place on a hardcourt, Djokovic’s best surface, at the major tournament he has won most often. Sunday’s payback came in Nadal’s kingdom. “Sorry for today,” Nadal said to Djokovic on court. Later, he elaborated. “As you know, I am not a big fan of revenge,” Nadal said. “I just accept when the things are not going the way that I like. In Australia, he played amazing.” He added: “Today was a little bit the opposite.” Djokovic had not lost a completed match in all of 2020, his only defeat coming in the fourth round of the United States Open when he was disqualified for striking a ball and inadvertently hitting a line umpire in the throat. Nadal skipped the U.S. Open to focus on Roland Garros, which seemed like a masterstroke on Sunday as he looked fresh, focused and so quick off the mark. Djokovic, a 17-time major singles champion with a 17-10 record in major finals, had never lost a set, 6-0, in a Grand Slam final. “I thought I was in a great form,” Djokovic said. “Certainly I could have played better, especially in the first two sets. But, you know, just he did surprise me with the way he was playing, the quality of tennis he was producing.” Djokovic, the bristle-haired and elastic Serb, finished with 52 unforced errors and 38 winners and had his serve broken seven times (he won under 50 percent of his service points). Still, he stuck with many of the patterns that had worked well throughout this tournament and in Rome, where he won the Italian Open last month on clay. But his many drop shots rarely fooled Nadal, who had practiced chasing drop shots extensively ahead of the final. “I wanted to kind of disrupt his rhythm, obviously,” Djokovic said. “But he was ready. He was there, he was prepared. He was playing all the right shots today.” That has so often been the case at Roland Garros, and if Sunday’s emphatic victory resembled any other, it was the 2008 final against the No. 1 ranked Federer, which Nadal won, 6-1, 6-3, 6-0 (amazingly, they remain friends). Djokovic at least generated a suspenseful third set. He battled back from an early break to break Nadal’s serve for the only time in the match, unleashing a fists-clenched roar that is often his way of underscoring that the momentum has shifted. But Nadal calmly and relentlessly snatched it back. At 5-5, 30-40, Djokovic hit a second serve close to the line that was initially called good but then called out for a double fault after an inspection of the mark by the chair umpire, Damien Dumusois. Djokovic took a second look and then headed glumly to his chair. Nadal served out the victory at love, finishing with a crisply sliced ace and falling to his knees. Surely not even he imagined beating Djokovic, the second most accomplished clay-court player of Nadal’s era, quite like this. Nadal and Djokovic have faced each other 56 times: the longest men’s rivalry of the Open era. Djokovic leads by the narrow margin of 29-27. “Today, you showed why you are the king of clay,” Djokovic said during the awards ceremony. “I experienced it in my own skin.” Nadal did not drop a set in seven matches, and Sunday’s victory was his 100th in a match at Roland Garros. That would certainly have been the number of the day if not for Federer’s record. Nadal and Federer have been respectful rivals for more than a decade, playing some of the most memorable matches in the game’s long history, including their classic 2008 Wimbledon final, won by Nadal in five sets not long after that Roland Garros rout. But Federer, 39, is nearly five years older than Nadal and had always been ahead of him in the Grand Slam chase. Until Sunday. “Of course I care,” Nadal said after long being reluctant to discuss the chase. “I am a big fan of the history of sport in general. For me, it means a lot to share this number with Roger.” The Grand Slam singles record has become the most significant reference point in the game in this era with Federer, Nadal and Djokovic dominating the men’s game.
