By Ivan Nechepurenko and Anton Troianovski MINSK, Belarus — President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus, long known as “Europe’s last dictator,” tried on Monday to deflate nine days of widespread protests by rallying what was supposed to be his blue-collar base: the workers of the Minsk Wheel Tractor Plant. They responded, video footage from the scene showed, with chants of “Go away!” It was the latest dismal turn for Mr. Lukashenko in his increasingly desperate effort to hold on to power. Mr. Lukashenko, an authoritarian who has ruled since 1994, faces an uprising from all corners of Belarusian society in the wake of fraud-ridden presidential elections early this month that, he claimed, he had won in a landslide. On Monday, a day after more than 100,000 people demanded new elections in a huge protest in Minsk, the capital, Mr. Lukashenko remained defiant. He signaled he would cling to power in Belarus, a country of 9.5 million people that is sandwiched between Russia and Poland and has long been a key ally for Moscow.
