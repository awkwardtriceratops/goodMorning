By Ginia Bellafante “DO NOT test your child for Covid.” So began a text that recently circulated on the messaging platform WhatsApp, among yeshiva parents in Brooklyn’s Orthodox Jewish community. The note advised them to keep sick children at home but to “indicate they have a stomachache or symptoms not consistent with Covid.” Any admission that their children were feverish, coughing or exhibiting other signs associated with the disease that has killed more than 200,000 Americans might eventually force a school to close for some period of time and it was “up to parents” to make sure such an outcome was avoided. Stealth strategies were not going to work, however. A few days after the text had made the rounds — on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, as it happened — the New York City health department announced that Covid-19 was growing at “an alarming rate’’ in several neighborhoods, most of which contain significant Orthodox populations. These areas were outpacing the citywide average by close to four times the rate. Even in advance of Yom Kippur, and out of concern that the holidays would loosen any resolve around social distancing, Mayor Bill de Blasio had threatened further lockdowns and restrictions if behaviors around Covid rules did not change. On Sunday he acted on those warnings, announcing that he would shut down all nonessential businesses and schools in nine ZIP codes in Brooklyn and Queens, including the yeshivas that offer religious education to tens of thousands of Jewish children in New York. A day later, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo pre-empted that plan, saying that businesses could stay open, but that the schools would still close. The complications for these parents are enormous, given that many large Hasidic families live in small, cramped apartments, typically without internet access and often with just a landline. Learning remotely would be a disaster for these children. “Without that access and many times with no landline, there might be families with a dozen children in an apartment and no real opportunity for remote learning,’’ Lani Santo, the executive director of Footsteps, an organization that helps former members of Orthodox groups, told me.
