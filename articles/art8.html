Include your name and location, or a request to remain anonymous. Letters may be edited. I have a job I enjoy, and it’s going well. I’ve been getting more responsibility, and I get on well with most of my colleagues. But one woman on my team has taken a very strong dislike to me. Every time I say or do anything in a meeting, she puts me down. She refuses my meeting invitations and makes snarky comments about me in front of others. I’ve tried to rise above it, but it’s wearying — and interfering with my work. I need her input on a shared project, and the attitude is making it difficult. I haven’t said anything to our boss because I’m embarrassed. I feel like I’m worrying about a mean girl in class. Is now the time to ask for help? How? — Anonymous Like most people, I am no stranger to bullies and other petty tormentors. In high school, I assumed things would get better in college, and in college, I assumed things would improve when I entered the workplace, and when I entered the workplace, I realized there are always going to be mean girls and mean boys — people who take out their personal problems or deficiencies on professional colleagues. Before you go to your boss, which may end up being your most effective option, have you tried having a direct conversation with this woman? Bullies often back down when they are confronted. They tend to pick on people they think they can bully. If you push back, you will let her know you are not going to be her punching bag. You’re clearly not looking for friendship with this woman. You simply need her to act like an adult so the two of you can work together and make your shared project the best it can be. I would ask her why she treats you so poorly, outline your expectations for how she should treat you and make clear that you’re just interested in developing a functional professional relationship.
