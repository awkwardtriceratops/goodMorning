By Jessica Grose “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” is a rollicking talk show on Bravo. Its host, Mr. Cohen, is the network’s in-house yenta and debate moderator among its many warring reality TV personalities. Typical topics of conversation in his delightful, boozy clubhouse used to include whether the guests have had plastic surgery and whether they would burn outfits they wore in the 1990s. But since it’s 2020, Mr. Cohen grills his guests on whether their castmates are practicing safe coronavirus hygiene. “Which housewife was most guilty of not following proper social distancing guidelines?” Mr. Cohen recently asked Shannon Storms Beador, of “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” a show in its 15th season that follows the travails of six mostly blonde women as they live, laugh, love and throw wine at each other in Southern California. Ms. Beador replied, “Kelly Dodd,” and Mr. Cohen said, “I’m stunned!” his voice dripping with faux shock. Ms. Dodd — who now goes by her married name, Leventhal, on social media — has been skeptical about mask wearing on Instagram, and when several of her more than 900,000 followers challenged her, she snapped back: “it’s not a pandemic anymore!! Did you read the CDC numbers!! My platform isn’t to be a sheep [sheep emoji] my platform is to be an independent thinker!” Ms. Leventhal is not the only reality star to be criticized for her coronavirus hygiene, or lack thereof. Big Ed of “90 Day Fiancé” on TLC was taken to task on social media for cozying up to fans without a mask. Kristin Cavallari, the star of “Very Cavallari,” which recently finished its final season on the E! Network, was slammed for taking a luxury trip to the Bahamas in mid-March, after parts of the United States were put on lockdown. But Ms. Leventhal does stand out for her very vocal skepticism of masks, and longtime viewers have noticed, with some podcasters and fan pages boycotting the new season of her show in part because of her spread of coronavirus misinformation. (The Times tried to contact Ms. Leventhal for comment through Bravo, and the network said she was not available.) She’s not the only one super-spreading anti-mask sentiments. Siggy Flicker, a former Real Housewife of New Jersey, has posted anti-mask memes on her Instagram, which has more than 400,000 followers. In a comment about masks, she wrote: “i hate them and only wear them when i need to walk into a restaurant or supermarket. how do you feel about being a beautiful sheep.” Some of Ms. Flicker’s views go far beyond an opposition to masks. She has also used QAnon-related slogans on social media and has posted misinformation about the source of Covid-19. If you have made it this far into the article and are not already an obsessive fan of reality TV, you may be thinking: Who cares what these people say about coronavirus? But there is research that shows the health-related behaviors of reality stars can affect viewers’ behavior, and now that these personalities have popular social media platforms, their claims have an unmediated reach as we hit another peak in coronavirus cases. With the caveat that we don’t really know the impact of mask wearing from influencers because the pandemic is so new, “reality TV research has been linked to health behavior for the past couple of decades,” said Mark Flynn, an associate professor of communication and media studies at Emmanuel College in Boston. Mr. Flynn has published research on reality stars drinking, smoking and sexual activity, as well as the impact of social media on body image. There’s also evidence that celebrity endorsement of a discredited link between vaccines and autism has contributed to much more skepticism of vaccines among Americans. It’s also possible that, currently, “these media figures might have an outsize role” in altering our behavior, said Kristen Elmore, a research associate at the Bronfenbrenner Center for Translational Research at Cornell University. That could be because in-person interactions with friends and family, who are typically influential in our health choices, are curtailed because of the pandemic. What’s more, viewers can see themselves in reality stars and influencers in a way they don’t with actors on scripted television or movies, even if the reality stars’ lives are more gilded and their houses are supersized. “Maybe they’re not like me, but they’re still real people,” Mr. Flynn said. And we are watching them live through the coronavirus, just like us. The virus has made an appearance not just on various Housewives franchises, but also on “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” and “90 Day Fiancé.”
