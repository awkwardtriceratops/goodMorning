Here Are Their Roots.<br></h1><p id="artcont">The unfounded ideas have been circulating online for months. By Davey Alba and Ben Decker In a wide-ranging interview with the Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Monday night, President Trump spread multiple conspiracy theories about the protests that have erupted across the nation. Many of his unfounded claims can be traced back to narratives that have been swirling online for months. Here are three of the baseless conspiracy theories that Mr. Trump spread and where they came from. During the interview with Ms. Ingraham, Mr. Trump claimed that “we had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend, and in the plane it was almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that.” Mr. Trump then alleged that the people were headed to Washington, D.C., to disrupt the Republican National Convention. There is no evidence of a flight matching Mr. Trump’s description. But the claim is similar to a baseless allegation that appeared online as early as June, when a wave of cities and towns became alarmed by unsubstantiated rumors that the loose collective of anti-fascist activists known as antifa was being sent into their communities to disrupt the peace. On June 1, a man from Emmett, Idaho, posted on Facebook: “Be ready for attacks downtown and residential areas. At least a dozen males got off the plane in Boise from Seattle, dressed head to toe in black.” He claimed, “One had a tattoo that said ‘Antifa America’ on his arm.” The post was shared nearly 4,000 times. That same day, the local sheriff’s office posted that there was no merit to the rumor. “The Payette County Sheriff’s Office has not had contact with and has not verified that antifa is in Payette County,” it said. “The Payette County Sheriff’s Office has not given any specific warnings to our citizens about antifa or other organizations.” It was shared only 716 times on Facebook. The idea resurfaced prominently again last week when Senator Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, spoke about protesters who confronted him at the Republican convention. “You just think, ‘Oh, these are some normal hoodlums from a big city.’ I promise you that at least some of the members and the people who attacked us were not from D.C.,” Mr. Paul said, according to Politico. “They flew here on a plane. They’ve all got fresh, new clothes.”
