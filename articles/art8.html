He’s visited scores of patients fearful of the hospital. By Azam Ahmed REYNOSA, Mexico — Gustavo Gutiérrez pulled up to the residential corner and scanned the street. Before long, a man ran toward him, desperation etched on his face. “Inside, doctor, she’s inside,” the man said, pointing to his home. His wife was dying of Covid. In the darkened living room, the woman, Dolores Bustamante Robles, slumped on a sofa, slowly sipping oxygen from a rusted tank. The doctor stooped to check her vitals. The family braced for bad news. “What’s your favorite food,” Dr. Gutiérrez finally asked. Confused, she whispered, “Tamales?” “Good,” he said, tucking the stethoscope in his bag. “When you’re all better, I’m coming over and you’re going to cook me some.” If laughter heals, Dr. Gutiérrez, an affable physician and one-man roving medical clinic, has developed a rare practice in the turbulent times of Covid-19. He relies on humor, positivity and intimacy, qualities most patients have been robbed of by the pandemic. He is also addressing one of the most vexing issues facing Mexican officials battling the virus: a refusal by patients to seek treatment from hospitals. A deep-seated fear of hospitals has meant thousands die at home without receiving proper care. Indeed, having seen the crowded, ghastly conditions and rampant infections in Reynosa’s medical centers, where he himself caught the virus, Dr. Gutiérrez could hardly blame them. And so he devised an elegant solution: He would, against all advice, deliver treatment directly to those in need. By his count, he’s seen well over 200 patients in their homes since June, traveling between Reynosa, the state’s largest city with 600,000 people, and Matamoros, another large border town.
