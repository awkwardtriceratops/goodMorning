By Ezra Marcus Ellis Whiteaker, 11, didn’t know what he might find when he went hunting in his basement in Fayetteville, N.C. But he had seen a call for fishing antiques on a social-networking app he uses (he’s been an avid fishermen since age 4) and knew that his grandfather, a former Air Force pilot who passed away before Ellis was born, had left some very old stuff in boxes. What he found were six antique rods — one with a handle carved in the shape of a baseball bat. He looked it up, and a similar model on eBay was selling for around $700. “It was really neat-looking,” said Ellis’s mom, Sarah Whiteaker. And, of course, the value of the item “made him feel excited.” Vintage fishing gear falls into a category of collectibles sometimes dubbed “mantiques,” which includes hunting paraphernalia like antique rifles and duck decoys. But unlike antique cars, say, which can’t be hidden for decades in the basement of one’s home, antique fishing lures and reels can be packed away and appreciating in value for years, unbeknownst to their owners. John Stephenson, a buyer for the British fishing auction house Thomas Turner, said he fields 10 to 20 phone calls a day from people inquiring about items they’ve found. Of those, he estimates, one in 10 have some value. Once a month, someone brings in something to his auction house that is worth five figures. “There are many more people looking for them now than there were 50 years ago,” he said of fishing antiques. Over the past several hundred years, there have been endless variations of fishing tackle — rods, reels, flies and lures — providing fertile ground for collectors, who thrive on subtle distinctions and rarity. “The 1850s period to the 1950s is the golden hundred years, where after that point fishing tackle became virtually all mass produced, and it lost the handmade appeal,” said Jim Schottenham, the valuator for Lang’s Auction, which specializes in fishing tackle. In an effort to uncover some of these forgotten gems, Lang’s Auction worked with Fishbrain, the app for avid fisherman, to encourage people to go treasure hunting in their own homes, using a catalog-style listing of rare items as inspiration. (This initiative is what prompted Ellis to ransack his basement.) One item on the Lang’s wish list is a reel and rod set from 1876 inlaid with gold and topaz; if found, it’s expected to sell for more than $100,000. According to Mr. Schottenham, the market for fishing antiques accelerated in the late 1970s. In 1985, The New York Times reported that an antique reel fetched $5,000 at auction. In the 1990s the market got even bigger, as buyers and sellers began connecting online. Today, fishing auction houses advertise heavily, encouraging people who aren’t necessarily fishermen to go sifting through their attics and basements.
