This year, with no fans in the seats, there is chatter galore between coaches and players, even though it breaks the rules. By Matthew Futterman The prohibition against coaching during a match at the United States Open is supposed to be straightforward. “Coaching is considered to be communication, advice or instruction of any kind and by any means to a player,” Article III, Section L states on page 44 of the 2020 Official Grand Slam Rule Book. This year, not so much. At this tournament, the strict prohibition is largely being ignored, two years after it prompted one of the most contentious moments in recent U.S. Open history — a harsh confrontation at the 2018 women’s final when the chair umpire issued a code violation to Serena Williams for receiving coaching. Because of the lack of ticket-buying spectators, coaches have been among the few people watching matches, and chatter with their players has become one of the unforeseen consequences of staging a Grand Slam tournament in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. The stadiums are silent and nearly empty. The players have no one else to turn to for support during the pressure cooker of one of the world’s biggest tournaments. There are fewer umpires to police violations. And, in some cases, masks hide the moving lips of each coach. The resulting combination is plenty of communication — sometimes in both directions — between the players and the people most important to their success. “What do I do?” Frances Tiafoe said as he grabbed a towel placed a few feet from his coach, Wayne Ferreira, in the middle of his five-set thriller in the second round against John Millman of Australia. At that moment, Tiafoe was getting drilled. Ferreira’s response could not be heard from six feet behind him. But two sets later, as Tiafoe chased down two would-be winners in the corners and closed down on the comeback win, he returned to the towel and Ferreira. “Is that what you mean by playing some defense?” Tiafoe said. Ferreira responded: “D. D. D.” Asked later about his running conversation with Ferreira during the match, Tiafoe said it had been a way to both pass the time and search for an edge. “Some of it’s boredom; some of it’s trying to get information,” he said. Tiafoe explained that Ferreira had criticized him for not working hard to extend points. “He’s like, ‘You don’t play defense.’ I was like, ‘Man, I’m one of the guys with the quickest wheels here.’ He’s like, ‘Yeah, but you always bail out on defense.’ Then I was like, ‘How is that for defense, Wayne?’ Kind of like throwing some shade at him.” That all of this is unfolding at the U.S. Open is a bit ironic. In 2018, the chair umpire punished Serena Williams for being coached by Patrick Mouratoglou during the final against Naomi Osaka. Williams did not appreciate being accused of cheating and exploded later in the match when she was penalized a point for slamming her racket to the ground. Mouratoglou later admitted he had signaled to Williams during play. All of this speaks to a larger question for the sport: Where is the line between encouragement and coaching? Grand Slam singles, after all, is meant to be a solo performance. Yet other solo athletes have support. Boxers have corners. Golfers have caddies. In tennis, each player attempts to solve the puzzle of a match alone. After the Williams incident in 2018, the tennis world debated whether the prohibition on coaching was outdated. This year, the WTA Tour began allowing coaching during its events because it was too hard to police, though coaching remains prohibited for women during the Grand Slams.
