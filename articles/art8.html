By Aurelien Breeden PARIS — The French authorities said on Friday that they had arrested a man suspected of being in contact with an assailant who killed three people at a church in Nice on Thursday, an attack that rattled the country and reignited fears of terrorism as officials blamed some foreign leaders for stoking hatred of France. An official in the French judiciary, who was not authorized to speak publicly on a continuing investigation, said that the suspect, a 47-year-old man, had been arrested on Thursday night, but did not provide further details. French security forces routinely use a wide scope when arresting and questioning suspects’ family, friends and contacts after an attack. Gérald Darmanin, the interior minister, said that France faced a high-level threat of terrorism and was being “particularly targeted” because of what he called the country’s staunch defense of freedom of expression and secularism. Debates about cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad have strained France’s relations with some Muslim-majority countries since the beheading of a teacher in a Paris suburb by a Muslim man this month. In Thursday’s attack, a man entered the Notre-Dame basilica in Nice shortly after it opened in the morning and fatally attacked three people with a seven-inch knife. Two similar knives were found near his bag, which was left in the church. The police confronted the assailant at the church while the attack was in progress, shooting and wounding him. The suspect, a Tunisian man in his early 20s, is still hospitalized. It was not immediately clear how the second arrested man might be connected to the attack or what contacts he had with the main suspect, who was not known to the French police or intelligence services. Mr. Darmanin, the interior minister, told RTL radio on Friday that the main suspect had arrived in Italy from Tunisia last month and then apparently traveled on to France hours or days before the attack. One of the victims, a 60-year-old woman, had her throat cut so deeply that it was akin to a decapitation, according to France’s top antiterrorism prosecutor. Another victim, Vincent Loquès, a 55-year-old man who was the church’s sacristan, also had serious throat wounds. The third victim — a 44-year-old Brazilian woman living in France, according to the Brazilian authorities — escaped the basilica but died of her wounds shortly afterward. Mr. Darmanin also said that he had warned the local security authorities around the country last Sunday of heightened security risks after a group close to Al Qaeda issued a statement calling for people to attack French targets, including churches and embassies.
