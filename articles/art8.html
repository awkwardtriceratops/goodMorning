By Dave Itzkoff NBC’s news division came under fire this week for hosting a town hall event with President Trump on Thursday night that competed with a similar program that ABC had already scheduled with Joseph R. Biden Jr. But the conflicting broadcasts generated some content for NBC’s entertainment side, where “Saturday Night Live” lampooned the dueling events and took some satirical shots at the network for its role in the controversy. This weekend’s “S.N.L.”, which was hosted by Issa Rae and featured the musical guest Justin Bieber, began with a voice-over that promised a re-airing of the two town halls, calling NBC’s event “a thirst trap for President Trump.” Now, the voice-over said, the events would be presented as most viewers had originally watched them: “Flipping back and forth, trying to decide between a Hallmark movie and an alien autopsy.” The sketch opened on Mikey Day as the ABC moderator George Stephanopoulos, who explained that in his town hall, “The folks asking questions are half pro-Biden, and half anti-Trump.” He introduced Jim Carrey in his recurring role as Biden, who took the stage in a pair of aviator sunglasses and making his familiar finger guns at the crowd. Day asked him if he was ready to receive “softball questions from folks who are already voting for you.” Meanwhile, on the NBC side of the parody, Kate McKinnon introduced herself as “surprise badass” Savannah Guthrie and said, “If you were angry at NBC for doing this town hall, just let me get a few questions in and I think you’ll thank me.” She welcomed Alec Baldwin as President Trump, telling him, “We have lots of voters waiting to ask questions but I’d like to start by tearing you a new one.” In successive responses, Baldwin declined to distance himself from white supremacy (“I’ve always more or less condemned it,” he said), QAnon (“If anyone’s against pedophiles, it’s me, the man who was close personal friends with one of the most famous pedophiles on earth — rest in power, Jeffrey”) the Aryan Brotherhood (“They’re very pro-family, that’s all I know”) and the Ku Klux Klan (“Your car breaks down, you call Triple-K”). Asked about his recovery from coronavirus, Baldwin replied, “I had a small fever. It was around 100. Celsius. But I did great. I never died, never saw hell or the devil. He never showed me a list of my sins. I was just alive and strong the whole time.” Chloe Fineman played Paulette Dale, the audience member who told President Trump that he had “a great smile,” and Ego Nwodim was cast as Mayra Joli, who nodded enthusiastically during many of the president’s responses.
