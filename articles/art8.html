Now he is rushing to deliver President Trump’s third justice. By Catie Edmondson When Senator Lindsey Graham joined a Republican blockade of President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee in 2016, he went out of his way to frame his position that a confirmation to the court should never be allowed in an election year as principled, apolitical and utterly permanent. “I want you to use my words against me,” Mr. Graham said then, swearing that he would hold the same stance even if it meant denying a future Republican president the chance to confirm his chosen nominee. But less than 24 hours after that hypothetical became a reality with the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday, Mr. Graham, now the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, made a complete and brazen reversal. He promised that he would push forward immediately to confirm President Trump’s pick — seemingly unbothered by the obvious conflict between his position four years ago and his stance now. “I am certain if the shoe were on the other foot,” Mr. Graham wrote Monday to Democrats on the judiciary panel, “you would do the same.” Just weeks before Election Day, the turnabout by Mr. Graham, whose panel will lead the confirmation process for Mr. Trump, captures the broader flip-flop of almost the entire Senate Republican Conference, as dozens of senators who held together in 2016 to prevent Mr. Obama from filling a Supreme Court seat now rush to deliver the current president his choice to replace Justice Ginsburg. For Mr. Graham, who is facing a tougher-than-expected re-election contest in South Carolina, it is also the latest stage in a remarkable political transformation, from conservative institutionalist and outspoken critic of Mr. Trump to a loyal foot soldier for the president. His switch has drawn bitter criticism from Mr. Graham’s political opponents, an ad attacking him as hypocritical and even protests outside his Capitol Hill home, where demonstrators with megaphones and drums gathered Monday morning to demand he not begin the confirmation proceedings. “He said, ‘Use my words against me!’” they chanted. In South Carolina, Jaime Harrison, the Democrat challenging Mr. Graham, was quick to snap up the senator’s 2016 invitation to use his own statements against him. “My grandpa always said that a man is only as good as his word,” Mr. Harrison wrote on Twitter, linking to video of Mr. Graham’s  comments. “Senator Graham, you have proven your word is worthless.” A spokesman for Mr. Graham’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Graham has sought to justify his reversal as a direct response to Democrats’ attempts to weaponize the judicial confirmation process, first by doing away with the filibuster that allowed a minority to block lower-court judicial nominees, and then by stridently opposing Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s nomination in 2018 during a heated confirmation battle. But the change in confirmation rules occurred in 2013, long before Mr. Graham had made his “use my words against me” declaration. And the brutal hearings on Justice Kavanaugh’s nomination had already concluded when Mr. Graham reiterated that position in an interview with The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg, saying, “If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term and the primary process has started, we’ll wait till the next election.” In the letter to Democrats on Monday, Mr. Graham offered another reason for his new stance, describing it as a matter of fairness to voters, because, “unlike in 2016, President Trump is currently standing for re-election: The people will have a say in his choices.”
