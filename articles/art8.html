He’ll Have to Start at Home.<br></h1><p id="artcont">America has to be a functioning democracy before it can be an exemplary one. By Michelle Goldberg Opinion Columnist During the end of Barack Obama’s presidency and the beginning of Donald Trump’s, Frances Brown served as the director for democracy on the staff of the National Security Council. It was her job to help coordinate administration efforts to support democracy, encourage free and fair elections, and oppose authoritarianism abroad. Among America’s most important tools in this regard, she told me, are statements from its political leaders and high-level diplomats backing democratic moves in other countries and speaking out against autocratic ones. Obviously, American denunciation was not enough to arrest authoritarianism, but it wasn’t meaningless, either. “The idea of closer relations to the U.S. and Oval Office visits, a photo-op — that still matters to many leaders around the world,” said Brown. Besides, for better or worse, America would sometimes pair its rhetoric with economic pressure or limits on arms sales. “Those kinds of policies often do accompany public condemnation,” she said, though they tend to be “more under the radar.” These days, Brown, who left the government in the summer of 2017, often thinks about the memos she’d have written if she’d seen Trump’s actions in another country: “Leader uses security services to ‘dominate’ peaceful protesters. Leader refuses to pledge a peaceful transition of power if he loses upcoming election. Leader threatens extrajudicial imprisonment of political opponents. Leader threatens members of press. Leader encourages violent nonstate militia that targets minority population.” It’s possible, even likely, that America will jettison that leader after next week’s election. But if we do, a President Joe Biden won’t be able to simply pick up America’s role in the world where it left off four years ago. The country has been brought too low, its example — always imperfect and often hypocritical, but inspiring to many nonetheless — too tarnished. It will take time before the United States is in a position to criticize democratic backsliding anywhere else. Biden wants to withdraw America from the informal axis of authoritarians that Trump has joined, to re-establish it as a democratic beacon. “The triumph of democracy and liberalism over fascism and autocracy created the free world,” Biden wrote in a Foreign Affairs essay in January titled “Why America Must Lead Again.” “But this contest does not just define our past. It will define our future, as well.” America, however, has to be a functioning democracy before it can be an exemplary one. Biden acknowledged as much in Foreign Affairs; his piece has a long section on “Renewing Democracy at Home.” American leaders once realized that segregation discredited them in the ideological struggle of the Cold War. Today deep injustices — some created by Trump and some merely exacerbated by him — discredit America again. That means that fighting voter suppression, racist policing practices and kleptocratic corruption, as well as ending Trump’s barbaric treatment of migrants, aren’t just domestic priorities. They are preconditions for a successful Democratic foreign policy. George W. Bush’s foreign policy was undoubtedly more catastrophic than Trump’s. The carnage he instigated still rages, and because he cloaked his war-making in the high-flown language of promoting democracy, he made a mockery of America’s messianic pretensions. Yet Trump’s brutishly transactional presidency has somehow done even more than Bush’s to erode American influence.
