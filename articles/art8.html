The Justice Department has agreed to examine the case. By Maria Cramer An Illinois police officer who shot and killed a 19-year-old Black man who was sitting in a car that was reversing toward the officer has been fired, according to the police. The officer, who has not been publicly identified, was fired on Friday night, three days after the shooting, said Wayne Walles, the chief of police in Waukegan, Ill., 40 miles north of Chicago. “The City of Waukegan terminated the officer that discharged his firearm during that incident, for multiple policy and procedure violations,” Chief Walles said in a statement on Friday. The Illinois State Police said on Thursday that they were investigating the killing of the man, Marcellis Stinnette, who was in the passenger seat of a car being approached by the officer. Once the investigation is complete, it will be turned over to the office of the Lake County state’s attorney, Michael Nerheim, for review. Mr. Nerheim said he asked the Justice Department on Wednesday, the day after the shooting, “to review the circumstances surrounding this incident.” He said the Justice Department had agreed to examine the case. “I am confident in the work being done by the Illinois State Police and welcome the assistance of the F.B.I.,” Mr. Nerheim said in a statement. “As I have said before, once the investigation is concluded, all the evidence will be reviewed and a final decision will be made with respect to any potential charges.” Mr. Nerheim said it was “critical” to have “all available resources and as many independent fresh eyes as possible” on the case. Mr. Nerheim added, “I continue to urge calm as we undertake this process and pledge complete transparency.”
