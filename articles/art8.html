He’s seen here via FaceTime from his home in Honolulu, Hawaii.Credit...Tayler Smith for The New York Times Supported by By Rachel Strugatz St. Ives was all the rage when Letizia Timoni was in middle school. Letizia, now 16, and most of her friends used its exfoliating face scrub that smells like apricots and sloughs off the topmost layers of skin with ground walnut shells. As recently as February, St. Ives face masks and face washes were a part of her skin care regimen. A month later she found Hyram Yarbro and threw it all out. Mr. Yarbro, the purple-haired creator of Skincare by Hyram, a YouTube channel turned TikTok account, has captivated teenagers like Ms. Timoni during the pandemic with pointed product reviews, ingredient tutorials and quippy videos reacting to skin care routines of celebrities and influencers like Bella Thorne, Skai Jackson and Madison Beer. For the record, Mr. Yarbro, 24, does not approve of any of their skin care routines. His mantra is “ingredients don’t lie,” no matter the size or popularity of a brand or how famous the founder. He takes price into consideration and is uncompromising in his views on fragrance in skin care products, chemical sunscreens and face scrubs — especially St. Ives ones. “The moment Hyram came out and was so adamant about how terrible they are — he just annihilated this brand,” said Letizia, who lives in South Korea. Mr. Yarbro believes that the St. Ives scrubs are harsh on skin. They give instant gratification, leaving skin feeling smooth, he said, but ultimately cause inflammation, redness and sensitivity. (“Face scrubs in general are just trash,” he said in a May TikTok video.) In an email statement, St. Ives said: “Our St. Ives scrubs are beloved by millions.”. “While we appreciate Hyram’s opinion,” the statement added, “we respectfully disagree.” The statement continued: “We take pride in ensuring that our walnut shell powder exfoliant, used in many of our scrubs, is finely milled and polished so that each particle has a smooth surface to promote safe and effective exfoliation.” Ava Michael, 13, said she stopped using scrubs because of Mr. Yarbro. So has Chloe Ramsey, 14, and her friend Devon Blum, 12. Ava started to use Kiehl’s cleanser, and Chloe switched from a harsh sugar scrub to a cleanser with glycolic acid. None of them had heard of Skincare by Hyram until March. Now they’re all fans of serums and peels by the Ordinary, which cost about $7, and CeraVe, a drugstore brand — two of the influencer’s go-to’s. Mr. Yarbro has a business relationship with CeraVe but not with the Ordinary. “I saw companies profiting off customers’ ignorance,” Mr. Yarbro said. “At the very minimum, I started telling people that you didn’t have to pay that much money for good skin care.” MR. YARBRO’S ASCENT TO SKINFLUENCER FAME began right when people started to quarantine. Real clothes and makeup went the way of indoor dining, and interest in skin care and in-home self-care soared. In early March, Skincare by Hyram had just 100,000 TikTok followers. Today he has more than six million. “I grew up on a cattle ranch,” said Mr. Yarbro, who relocated from Arizona to Honolulu five years ago. “I thought the sun was your best friend.” Now he won’t go outside without slathering on sunscreen that is at least SPF 30. He is the authority in teenage skin care (ask anyone under 24), yet he’s not a dermatologist, chemist or aesthetician. He’s a former Saks Fifth Avenue makeup artist turned skin care fanatic who spent the last four years studying what, according to him, has amounted to thousands of ingredients. He followed dermatologists, aestheticians and chemists on social media, rabidly consuming their content and reaching out with questions. “They would call me out when I would say something wrong,” Mr. Yarbro said. “They still do now.” Early on, a follower studying to be an aesthetician corrected him about a statement he made about essential oils being good for sensitive skin (they’re not).
