Then Came Tennis Camp.<br></h1><p id="artcont">What playing doubles with a Parisian urologist taught me about how to get my life in order. By Pamela Druckerman Contributing Opinion Writer PARIS — While many Americans were cooped up at home or learning to love camping, in France (and many other places in Europe) we had an almost normal summer. Last month, I even managed to attend a weeklong adult tennis camp in southeastern France. It wasn’t exactly tennis as usual: We wore masks in the clubhouse, and kept our distance on the outdoor courts. We campers knew we were lucky to have a break — what the French call a “parenthèse” — from the pandemic. It was a relief to focus on our forehands instead of on whether the coronavirus might be on our groceries. I hoped that tennis might also solve another problem: Like many women, since Covid-19 emerged I’d retreated from my job and spent my days cooking and shouting about homework. My mind and body both felt flabby, and I wasn’t sure how to re-enter the working world. Amid these existential concerns, I arrived at camp having barely considered a more practical one: How will my undertrained middle-aged body cope with six hours of tennis and exercise per day? It is an immediate culture shock. At the end of a fitness class on day one, I am on my back, with my knees on a giant exercise ball, as a coach insists that I once again lift my “fesse” — that parlor-room-appropriate French word for “rear end.” “I can’t anymore, I’m too tired,” I groan. Normally I give up at the first sign of fatigue or pain. “There’s no tired here, we keep going!” he barks. To my surprise, I have entered a world where you can’t just complain and then quit. My morning tennis group is full of casual weekend players. I have time to learn that the doubles alley is a “couloir” (a hallway) and topspin is “le lift” (not to be confused with “le lifting,” a face-lift). But — aside from me — only the most hard-core players have signed up for the afternoons. Later that day I find myself on the court with a stocky Parisian urologist who attacks the ball like he is carving an errant prostate, and a 20-something from Guadeloupe whose forehands shoot off her racket like bullets. I feel guilty that they have to play with me. Our coach Nanette, a Dutchwoman in her 50s who once played on the pro tour, observes my struggles benevolently. “Don’t worry about power,” she says. “They supply the power. Just hit it in front of you.”
