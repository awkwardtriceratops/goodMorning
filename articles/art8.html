By J. David Goodman At the Rego Center, a small mall in Queens, handwritten signs that were common during the early days of the pandemic have once again started to pop up: “We’re closed! Estamos cerrados!” But a short walk away, at the Queens Center, shoppers carrying heavy bags busily maneuvered through the four-story mall. Diners ate at a first-floor Shake Shack. The only difference was that the two malls were on opposite sides of a line on a map, hastily drawn last week by the office of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, that separated areas of Brooklyn and Queens where coronavirus cases have been dangerously spiking — red zones, he called them — from neighboring areas that had lesser risk. Over the span of a few days, New York City has undergone a striking reversal of fortune. On the first day of October, restaurants had just reopened for indoor dining, subway ridership hit its highest level since the pandemic began and Mayor Bill de Blasio hailed the start of in-person public school, the only big-city mayor to even attempt such a feat. “We did it. You did it. New York City did it,” the mayor declared. “This is a key moment in our rebirth.” But now, New York enters a precarious stage as city and state leaders try something novel for an American city during the pandemic: simultaneously allowing reopenings in some neighborhoods while ordering businesses and schools to close in others. No other state has tried such a granular approach to rising cases, public health experts said, opting instead for closures at the county or state level. New York State’s plan cuts through city neighborhoods, ZIP codes and, in some cases, even streets. State and city officials hope this approach will prevent the need for any new citywide lockdowns, which could further devastate the local economy. Mr. de Blasio has warned that new shutdowns loom as more than 500 people test positive each day, and the number of New Yorkers hospitalized hit its highest level since the start of the summer, with the percentage of positive tests rising since last month. The state and city initially blamed the uptick on a lack of compliance with masking and social distancing rules in Orthodox Jewish communities, centering the closure zones around those areas. But rates have also been rising elsewhere, leading officials to monitor several other parts of the city.
