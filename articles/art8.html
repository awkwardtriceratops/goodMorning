Here’s the sign-up.] It’s Wednesday. Weather: Rain likely in the morning, turning partly sunny in the afternoon. Expect a high of around 60. Tonight will be mostly cloudy. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Sunday (All Saints Day). Keith Raniere did not have a visible reaction. He had just been sentenced to 120 years in prison on Tuesday for his role in leading a self-improvement company that prosecutors have described as a sex cult. In a Brooklyn courtroom earlier that day, more than a dozen victims gave wrenching testimony for hours about Mr. Raniere’s manipulation and abuse. One witness, identified only as Camila, recalled in a trembling voice the sexual abuse that she suffered starting at age 15. She described how Mr. Raniere ordered her to weigh less than 100 pounds and directed her to get an abortion. Others shared vivid memories of mistreatment. “I had never agreed to give up the right to my body,” said another witness, identified only as Nicole.

Former members of Mr. Raniere’s company, Nxivm, said he and his inner circle preyed on insecure people, shaming anyone who tried to quit. On Tuesday, victims described how Mr. Raniere had left them struggling to make their lives whole again and recalled how he strained or destroyed their relationships with family. Nxivm was founded in the late 1990s and became popular in Hollywood and business circles for its self-improvement workshops. But by 2017, several former members had asked the New York State authorities to investigate the company. The complaints focused on a secretive women-only group inside Nxivm (pronounced NEX-ee-um), created two years prior, where members were forced to have sex with Mr. Raniere and be branded with his initials. The sisterhood was billed as an empowerment group, but the women were referred to as “slaves,” needed permission to eat and were regularly required to hand over “collateral” like nude photographs. During his trial, former members testified that they were subjected to punishments including long-term confinement and being whipped with a leather strap.
