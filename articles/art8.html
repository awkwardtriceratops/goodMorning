But cheaper flights are one benefit. By Bill Saporito Mr. Saporito is a contributor to the editorial board. The airline industry, as we have known it for decades, is over. A restructured industry will be landing soon, changing how we fly and what we fly. The summer travel season so crucial to the industry’s profits was largely erased, as new coronavirus hot spots spread to Southern and Western states. The best-case scenario now is that domestic airline traffic returns to 50 percent of its pre-pandemic level by 2021, according to Boyd Group, an industry consultant. On Oct. 1, the day funding and industry protections embedded in the CARES Act expired, the major airlines began to carry out the service changes and layoffs that they had signaled were coming all summer: Industrywide, direct layoffs passed 50,000 as Congress dithered over more economic relief. American Airlines let go of 19,000 employees; United another 13,000. The commuter airline ExpressJet shut down, causing a loss of 2,800 jobs, making it the third regional airline to fall victim to the pandemic. The decline in air travel has, unsurprisingly, had devastating effects on tourism. Just before the airline layoffs were announced, the Walt Disney Company cast off 28,000 cast members in its theme park division, mostly in Florida and California. Tourists are still reluctant to fly to Tomorrowland, or Las Vegas, despite expansive airline safety and cleaning protocols and assurances that passengers have less than a 1 percent chance of catching the virus on a commercial jet. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes on its website, “social distancing is difficult on crowded flights, and sitting within six feet of others, sometimes for hours, may increase your risk of getting Covid-19.” Have a nice flight, though. Airlines must now downsize, rationalize and spruce up every piece of their operations. What does this mean for us customers? A mixed bag, but once the industry shrinks to fit the current demand it will lose the ability to expand quickly again should an economic rebound take place. So expect a permanent reduction in the number of flights for the next year. On the plus side, jet fleets will get younger (with Wi-Fi and outlets on almost every plane), and we may benefit from less fee-grubbing and a more consumer friendly travel experience. Pricing should remain competitive because carriers will still have way more capacity than they do demand and they need to generate cash. Jet fleets are being drastically overhauled. Say goodbye to wide-bodies such as the famed Boeing 747s, which first made transoceanic flight affordable, and Airbus’s giant A380s. These jets are too expensive to run if they’re not full, and few people are eager to share airspace with 300 to 500 other passengers.
