A lot of the work of my book is reinserting Islam and the Ottoman Empire into those stories to give us a fuller and, I would say, more empirically true story about all of these events that we think have something to tell us about the making of the modern world.” Benjamin Lorr visits the podcast to discuss his new book, “The Secret Life of Groceries,” which lifts the veil on the human labor, industrial agriculture and transportation challenges that go into stocking upscale food stores. Lorr explains that the book sprang from a deeply personal interest. “For a long time I’ve been fascinated by supermarkets,” he says. “I am the type of person who will go to a supermarket on their vacation and just browse around. I think there’s almost a hallucinogenic quality with these saturated bright colors, and the fact that you walk down the aisles and to me it’s both soothing and comforting — all this choice and abundance, like miracle land — but also there’s a power that radiates out of them, and it’s almost threatening. So I had long been drawn to the supermarket.” Also on this week’s episode, Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and Parul Sehgal and John Williams talk about what people are reading.
