Reporter/Producer Rukmini Callimachi Watch on Friday, Sept. 4, at 10 p.m. on FX and streaming on Hulu. Breonna Taylor had fallen asleep watching TV beside her boyfriend when Louisville police officers punched in her door with a battering ram. Fearing an intruder, her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, reached for his gun and fired one shot, wounding an officer. The police returned fire: A barrage of bullets from different directions tore through nearly every room in Taylor’s apartment, then into two adjoining ones. They sliced through a soap dish, a chair and a table and shattered a sliding-glass door. Taylor, a 26-year-old trained E.M.T. who hoped to become a nurse and kept her life goals written on Post-it notes around her apartment, was shot five times. She bled out on the floor of her own home. Unlike the killing of George Floyd, whose death in May under the knee of a white police officer in Minneapolis was captured on video, the circumstances that led to Taylor’s death in March are murky. There was no body camera footage from the Louisville police officers who opened fire that night. In a new documentary by The New York Times on FX and Hulu, we reveal details around Taylor’s life and the drug raid that ended in her death. Dozens of interviews with Taylor’s family, her boyfriend, witnesses and public officials, as well as a review of more than 1,500 pages of police records, evidence logs, transcripts of jailhouse recordings, 911 calls and surveillance photos help tell the story of what happened, and why. TRANSCRIPT The last thing she said was, “Turn off the TV.” Next thing I remember is a loud bang at the door. 911. Where is your emergency? Somebody kicked in the door. and shot my girlfriend three times. Help! No one never told me really what happened. I didn’t find out that she was shot by a police officer ‘til I saw it on the news. She had a very inviting personality. She always had, like, a problem solver attitude The media tried to assassinate Breonna’s character. We can’t keep quiet. Immediately, there were red flags. There were bullet holes everywhere. It was a war zone in there. Once the shooting occurred, they never searched the apartment any further. [Chanting] Breonna Taylor. Justice needs to be rendered. The question is, will that happen? It has to stop. Producers Lora Moftah and Lizzie Blenk
