By Kate Taylor CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — When Jie Zhao, a wealthy Maryland businessman, wanted to get his two sons into Harvard, federal prosecutors said on Monday, he made connections with the school’s longtime fencing coach, Peter Brand, who was having financial trouble. Over a five-year period, according to prosecutors, Mr. Zhao paid for Mr. Brand’s car. He made college tuition payments for the coach’s son. He paid off the mortgage on Mr. Brand’s house in a Boston suburb, and eventually purchased the house for an inflated price. After Mr. Brand bought a more expensive residence in Cambridge, Mr. Zhao paid to renovate it. In return, prosecutors said in a criminal complaint, Mr. Brand recruited Mr. Zhao’s sons to the Harvard fencing team, helping to secure their admission. Altogether, the payments to the fencing coach amounted to $1.5 million, prosecutors said.
