In 2020, Nothing Is Impossible<br></h1><p id="artcont">Supported by The lone Electoral College vote awarded by Nebraska’s Second Congressional District has gone to Joe Biden. It could be the vote that gets him to 270. By Dionne Searcey OMAHA — Tony Vargas stood on a street corner here on Election Day trying to rally passing drivers to re-elect him as state senator. A few blocks away was a meatpacking plant where workers walked off the job earlier this year after fears their bosses weren’t being transparent about a rising number of Covid cases inside. In the other direction was a polling place where Black and Latino voters lined up to cast ballots. On Wednesday, Nebraska awakened to the news that its Omaha-based Second Congressional District delivered a single, potentially pivotal electoral vote for Joseph R. Biden Jr. in a state that otherwise solidly tilted toward President Trump. Neighborhoods in the district like the one where Mr. Vargas stood and waved signs are part of the reason. “This same community voted in the past for Republicans and for Democrats, but with Biden they saw somebody who cares more about everybody,” said Mr. Vargas, who won his race Tuesday. “People are choosing the person over the politics.” Unlike 48 other states, Nebraska splits its electoral votes by congressional district. (Maine does also.) Both campaigns invested in reaching voters here, believing that it was not impossible that the final tally could come down to Omaha. It was a lightning-striking scenario, though. On Wednesday, as tense ballot counting droned on, it was apparent how important that solo electoral vote was in a district in the middle of the country. Mr. Biden notched victories in Michigan and Wisconsin. Arizona and Nevada were still counting ballots, though Democrats projected confidence in their chances. Pennsylvania was likely to take longer. By late in the afternoon, doing the math, that single Nebraska vote seemed as if it would put Mr. Biden up to 270. Much to the delight of Omaha’s Democrats, and the chagrin of the rest of the state.
