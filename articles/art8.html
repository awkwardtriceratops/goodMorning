The Taliban have outlasted a superpower through nearly 19 years of grinding war and now stand on the brink of realizing their most fervent desire: U.S. troops leaving Afghanistan. They have given up little of their extremist ideology to do it.

They know all too well what is at stake. There are a lot of ways to listen to The Daily. Here’s how. We want to hear from you. Tune in, and tell us what you think. Email us at thedaily@nytimes.com.
