By Remy Tumin and Jeremiah M. Bogert, Jr. (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Two Senate runoffs in Georgia have influenced Republicans’ refusal to recognize President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. Though most leading Republicans haven’t repeated President Trump’s false claims that he won, they have declined to acknowledge Mr. Biden’s win for fear of enraging the president and his base ahead of the Jan. 5 contests, which will determine which party controls the Senate. “We need his voters,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Republican. Two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, face Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock. Mr. Biden’s transition team is preparing plans for an ambitious agenda should Democrats win both seats, and a more pared-back one in case they fall short. Georgia will conduct a hand recount of the presidential vote, a move requested by the Trump campaign. Officials said it was unlikely to erase Mr. Biden’s slim lead of 14,000 votes in the state. 2. The Times called officials in every state. None reported any major voting issues, a forceful rejection of President Trump’s narrative. The president and his allies have baselessly claimed that rampant voter fraud stole victory from him. Election officials in dozens of states representing both political parties said that wasn’t the case. “There’s a great human capacity for inventing things that aren’t true about elections,” said Frank LaRose, above, a Republican and Ohio’s secretary of state. The U.S. has never before had to force an incumbent out of office. While that moment has not yet arrived, Mr. Trump has borrowed from the playbook of autocrats and dictators the U.S. has long fought to quash — denying defeat, claiming fraud and using government machinery to reverse election results. 3. Coronavirus infections and deaths are rising fast. The Trump administration remains largely disengaged. The White House task force has been all but publicly silent. Shortages of personal protective equipment are back, and governors are again competing with one another and big hospital chains for scarce gear. “With 1,000 deaths per day, it’s like two jumbo jets dropping from the sky,” an infectious disease expert said. “If every day, two jumbo jets would drop from the sky and kill everybody, don’t you think that everybody would be in a panic?” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made its most robust statement on mask use yet: Mask wearing protects you, not just those around you. Here’s how effective a swath of fabric can be. 4. Coronavirus restrictions are tightening in New York. As of Friday, the state will ban private indoor gatherings of more than 10 people and require bars and restaurants to close nightly at 10 p.m. The New York City area had seemed to keep the virus relatively contained, but infection rates have begun to increase sharply in the tristate area. Staten Island, which once bristled at coronavirus restrictions, now has the highest positive test rate in the city. Two months ago, India looked like a coronavirus disaster zone, with nearly 100,000 new infections a day and deaths shooting up. Today, reported infections, deaths and the share of people testing positive have all fallen significantly. But some researchers say that cases are falling off because of increased use of less reliable tests and fewer tests being administered. 5. Beijing effectively silenced Hong Kong’s legislature, one of the last remaining forums for dissent in the city, by granting broad new powers that allow the removal of lawmakers who do not show clear loyalty to China. The Hong Kong government immediately ejected four pro-democracy lawmakers, prompting the 15 remaining members of their bloc to vow to resign in solidarity, above, with a pledge to work outside the system. The departures will reshape the city’s political landscape, which has been upended since China imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong this summer. Elsewhere in Asia, the party led by Myanmar’s civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, is poised to stay in power. Her reputation overseas has been stained by her defense of a military accused of genocide, but in voting on Sunday, her party easily secured a parliamentary majority. Many voters from ethnic minorities were prevented from casting ballots. 6. For Veterans Day, we’re highlighting the experiences of military moms who have deployed, at great personal sacrifice. Lt. Col. Nichelle Somers, pictured above with her three children at their home in California, recalled how hard it was for the whole family when she was serving in Djibouti for seven months. Her struggle, she said, was what all military parents experience: “being separated from the kids, and not being able to help when things were not going well.” Stanley McChrystal, the retired U.S. army general, is one of a number of former military officers who reflected on the most valuable thing their parents taught them.
