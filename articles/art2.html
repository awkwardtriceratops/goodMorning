By Charles M. Blow Opinion Columnist Barack Obama — his policies and his posture — just won a third term. Joe Biden will be president because of his close association with Barack Obama, because he espoused many of the same centrist policies and positioning and because of public nostalgia for the normalcy and decency the Obama years provided. Biden is a restoration president-elect, elected to right the ship and save the system. He is not so much a change agent as a reversion agent. He is elected to Make America Able to Sleep Again. He doesn’t see his mission as shaking things up, but calming things down.
