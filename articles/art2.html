The chairman was recognized for completing a course for public officials. “Constitution Week” was hereby proclaimed. About fifteen minutes in, Ricky Short motioned for approval of Resolution 2020-27. Whereas the Virginia and U.S. constitutions speak of a “well-regulated militia,” it read, whereas a militia should be trained with arms “including modern semiautomatic rifles,” whereas a militia was “the last best hope” when liberties are threatened by “a tyrannical government,” then be it resolved: Halifax County would support a local militia. Ronnie Duffey seconded the motion. Throughout one of the most tumultuous political years in memory, armed paramilitary groups have marched: crowding into statehouse galleries, violently defending public monuments and now planning to show up at the polls on Election Day. Some of these groups have a national network and muster under the self-proclaimed pedigree of “militia,” while others are makeshift, assembling for a night or two of confrontation in the streets and then disbanding just as quickly. In Virginia over the past year, a number of rural counties have mulled resolutions that would officially endorse the assembly and training of local militias. At least three counties have approved them. The triggering event for these came last November, when Democrats won full control of the state government pledging an ambitious gun control agenda. In the winter of outrage that followed, gun owners poured into Richmond, crowded county board meetings and formed paramilitary groups in one county after another. Gun rights supporters say 91 of the state’s 95 counties, and many cities and towns, have passed what they call second amendment sanctuary resolutions forbidding enforcement of certain gun laws and declaring, at least symbolically, that the state’s authority in some matters stopped at the county line. But not everyone saw this fight as just about gun policy. It was also about power. Virginia had long been reliably conservative, governed by an old Southern politics that ranged from the right to the center but rarely too far beyond. Republicans had control of the governor’s office or the legislature or both for over a quarter century, if not calling the shots at least impeding the opposition. But as tobacco farms and textile mills steadily disappeared, hollowing out rural counties, the suburbs stretching southward from Washington, D.C., spread out like Virginia creeper, fed by culturally liberal college graduates from all over the world. Elections fully caught up to growth patterns in 2019. Conservatives suddenly found themselves out of power. “Virginia is not the Virginia it used to be,” lamented John Sharp, a supervisor in Bedford County, which passed a militia resolution in May. “We’re outvoted.” It could be that way for a long time. And if the current polls are right, it could soon be that way in Washington, too, leaving the right with a hold on the courts and little else. Some are preparing. “Biden’s coming for us; there will be a war,” said Paul Cangialosi, who works with the Virginia Militia Alliance, created after last year’s election to organize armed groups across the state.  “We don’t fix this at the ballot box, I hate to say it. We’re too divided.” Gun control, anti-coronavirus lockdowns, talk of a vaccine mandate: Mr. Sharp described it all as if it were an imposition by a remote colonial power.
