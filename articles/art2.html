Bronny James, Lebron’s eldest son, is a top basketball prospect, but the children of tennis greats Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf, who have 30 Grand Slam singles titles between them, never showed much interest in the sport. Then there is Cameron Burrell, who won the N.C.A.A. championship at 100 meters in 2018. His best time is 9.93, making him one of the fastest sprinters in the world. Cameron’s father, Leroy, is an Olympic gold medalist and the former world-record holder in the 100 meters. His mother, Michelle Finn-Burrell, has a sprint relay gold medal from the 1992 Olympics, too. His aunt Dawn was an Olympic long jumper, and one of his godfathers is also a sprinter of some renown — Carl Lewis. Now comes the hard part, because while it is certainly not easy to be among the very few to run 100 meters in less than 10 seconds, competing in the shadow of Olympic legends who happen to be in the family may be even more difficult. Also, the past two years, since Cameron completed his college career, have been filled with nagging injuries, periods of sagging confidence, logistical hassles, disappointing races, and now an Olympics delayed a year by a pandemic that has upset the structure and routine of an athlete who very much craves both. “I run just as fast as most pros and well enough to be ranked and make national teams, I just don’t do it often enough,” Cameron Burrell said recently. So where does Cameron, 26, turn for guidance? Lewis, whose feet appeared to float as he ran, and Leroy Burrell, the ultimate power sprinter, are his coaches. If they are on the road, Cameron’s mother fills in. All of them have high expectations for Cameron, given what he has already accomplished. “It’s a difficult burden for him to carry, but it’s his job, and he has to do it somehow,” Leroy Burrell said. “No one will work harder and listen and learn more than Cameron,” Lewis said in a recent interview. “The other part, though, is balancing the work and overthinking.” “He has to want it for himself, not for me, not for Leroy,” his mother said. Everywhere Cameron Burrell turns at home, there is another incredibly fast gold medalist with an answer. The Burrells never advertised their athletic accomplishments to their three children. They don’t have a trophy case in their living room in suburban Houston. Their gold medals were stored in a safe deposit box. One afternoon when their boys were young, Cameron and his brothers, were rummaging around the garage and found a bag filled with Team U.S.A. uniforms. “What is this stuff?” they asked.
