Details were scarce, and the police were still gathering evidence, he said. By Elaine Yu A police officer and another person were fatally shot on the west side of Cleveland on Thursday night, law enforcement officials said, but further details were not available and a motive was not immediately clear. The Cleveland police said on Twitter that an officer was shot about 10 p.m. at an intersection while on duty. Jeff Follmer, president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association, said that the second person was not believed to be a suspect in the officer’s death and that the police were still gathering evidence. Neither victim was immediately identified. But hours after the shooting, Cleveland’s police chief, Calvin Williams, told reporters that the slain officer had been a “25-plus-year veteran” of the force. “We’re still looking for a suspect or suspects in this case,” he added. Mayor Frank Jackson, speaking to reporters alongside Chief Williams outside the MetroHealth Medical Center, gave his condolences to the officer’s family. The Columbus division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said on Twitter that special agents were responding to the shooting. The killings in Cleveland came amid demonstrations around the country against police brutality and sporadic outbursts of looting and other violence. In Lacey, Wash, law enforcement agents fatally shot a supporter of the antifa movement, Michael Forest Reinoehl, on Thursday night as they moved to arrest him in the killing of a right-wing activist who had been part of a pro-Trump caravan in Portland, Ore., last week. In Rochester, N.Y., seven officers were suspended on Thursday in connection with the suffocation of a Black man, Daniel Prude, in police custody in March. His death had not received widespread attention until Wednesday, when video footage of his arrest was released, sparking protests in the city. Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Illinois, was arrested and charged on Wednesday in connection with the fatal shootings of two people during a night of protests in Kenosha, Wis., against the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. traveled to Kenosha to meet with the relatives of Mr. Blake, who remains hospitalized. Seeking to draw a contrast with President Trump, who also visited the city but focused on street violence and disorder, Mr. Biden held listening sessions in the community and spoke with Mr. Blake by phone. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
