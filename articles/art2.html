Electric Truck Partner, Quits Amid Fraud Claims<br></h1><p id="artcont">Trevor Milton, founder and executive chairman of Nikola, resigned after an investment fund accused him of making false assertions about the company’s technology. By Jack Ewing and Neal E. Boudette Less than two weeks after signing a $2 billion deal with General Motors, the founder of electric truck start-up Nikola Corp. stepped down amid a claim that he had repeatedly lied about the company’s technology. The resignation of Trevor Milton as executive chairman, announced late Sunday, came after the investment fund Hindenburg Research published a report accusing him of making numerous false assertions about Nikola’s technology, including once producing a video in which a truck was rolled down an incline to make it look as if the company had developed a working prototype. Hindenburg, a short-selling firm that said it was aiming to profit by betting Nikola’s share price would go down, called Nikola “an intricate fraud.” Its report appeared only days after the company and G.M. agreed to cooperate on production of battery-powered pickup trucks and hydrogen-powered heavy trucks. Nikola, based in Phoenix, called the accusations by Hindenburg “false and defamatory” and said it would complain to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nikola shares, which had jumped after the deal with G.M., lost 40 percent of their value after the Hindenburg report. On Monday morning, after the announcement of Mr. Milton’s resignation, the shares fell another 27 percent in early Wall Street trading. Bloomberg News reported last week that the S.E.C. was looking into the Hindenburg report, and The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department was doing so. Neither agency has confirmed that an investigation is underway. Mr. Milton said in a statement that “the focus should be on the company and its world-changing mission, not me. So I made the difficult decision to approach the board and volunteer to step aside.” Stephen Girsky, a former vice chairman of G.M. and a member of Nikola’s board, will take over as chairman. While denying Hindenburg’s accusations, Nikola acknowledged that a 2017 prototype truck that appeared in a promotional video was not operating under its own power. “Nikola never stated its truck was driving under its own propulsion in the video,” the company said in a statement. Nikola said it had since built fully functional models. The deal with G.M. held the prospect of providing crucial help in assembling a pickup truck that Nikola hopes to introduce by the end of 2022. In exchange, G.M. took an 11 percent stake in the company valued at the time at $2 billion. G.M. on Monday affirmed its resolve to go forward with the deal. “We will work with Nikola to close the transaction,” the company said in a statement. “Our overall goal is to put everyone in an E.V. and accelerate adoption.” Nikola listed its shares in June, and at the end of trading Friday was worth nearly $13 billion, although it essentially has no revenue and has not yet sold or produced a single truck. Analysts have been predicting that traditional carmakers like G.M. would form partnerships with fast-moving electric car start-ups in order to catch up with Tesla, which has a considerable lead in battery technology. G.M.’s deal with Nikola illustrates the hazards of that approach. Whatever the state of its technology, few companies have experienced Nikola’s meteoric rise. Mr. Milton, 39, is a college dropout who started a security alarm business and then a company that sought to convert diesel engines to run on natural gas before it ran into legal trouble and was sold. In 2014, he founded Nikola with a plan to produce zero-emission semi trucks that run on hydrogen fuel cells and batteries. His ambitions mirror those of another company that aimed to shake up the automotive industry, Tesla. Mr. Milton even drew on the same source for the name of his company — the Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla. Mr. Milton unveiled a semi truck, called the Nikola One, in 2016, and said it was operational. “It’s not a pusher,” Mr. Milton said at the event, using an industry term for a mock-up vehicle that cannot be driven and must be pushed. In its report, Hindenburg Research contended that the promotional video showing the moving 2017 prototype and Mr. Milton’s statements were part of “an ocean of lies.” It also accused Mr. Milton of claiming Nikola had proprietary technology, when it sourced components from suppliers.
