Maybe It Made Me Stupid.<br></h1><p id="artcont">A fishing trip is a reminder of the impulses that stop us from protecting ourselves. By Julia O’Malley Ms. O’Malley is a journalist. KASILOF, Alaska — I arrived at fish camp to find a sofa on the beach with a fire beside it, crackling inside a washing machine drum. A few hours before, I’d taken my first flight since the pandemic began — humming low in a small plane from Anchorage to the small town of Kenai. My destination: the mouth of the Kasilof River. My boyfriend, Jack, fishes that river every year. I came to join him. Like many Alaskans in the summertime, we were after salmon to fill our freezer. Jack’s friend, K, ran the operation, stringing nets into the water to snare the salmon as they muscle in from the ocean on the tide. A group of his friends rotated through to help haul nets and cut fish, all of us taking home fillets for our labor. Most of the time at fish camp, though, we didn’t work. We watched the nets soak and waited on the tide. That day, as Tom Waits bellowed from a little speaker, a couple of K’s friends, who were also helping at camp, took a seat across the fire from me. Wasn’t long till we were in one of those conversations between people on opposite sides of America’s political chasm. Antifa. How transgender athletes are taking over women’s sports. The injustice of affirmative action. Usually I appreciate how Alaska makes me sort out liking — or even loving — people with different politics. But I knew we’d eventually talk about the virus. I wasn’t sure I could take it. After an initial, effective shutdown, Alaska reopened its businesses in May. By the time I got to Kenai, in June, people were throwing barbecues and returning to church. Cases had started increasing in the area, and would soon rise quickly in Anchorage, too. Compared with states like Texas and Arizona, Alaska had too few cases and too few deaths for most people to have firsthand experience. And the way Alaskans saw virus risk had grown increasingly politicized, depending on where people got their news. I had just read a story about masks in the Anchorage Daily News posted on Facebook. It was buried in comments, quoting obscure doctors, about how they didn’t work. Commenters, some of whom I knew, kept posting that the virus was no different than the flu. I didn’t know whether K’s friends took it seriously, but I could guess. They’d already been telling me about stories they were reading on the far-right One America News Network. Turned out, though, I was wrong. A couple of hours into our wait, the guys got a call. Their co-worker had tested positive. Suddenly they looked scared and embarrassed. They didn’t want to get us sick. K proposed we mask up and distance ourselves. His friends left for town to get tested. The rest of us went out to check the nets. Gulls dove and screamed as Jack rowed the rubber dinghy out to the furthest buoy. K hoisted the net over the bow. One salmon appeared, then another, with iridescent eyeballs and mouths chewing air. Fish piled around our feet in a pool of pink water and old beer cans.
