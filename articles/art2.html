The figure hit the threshold last week. There are questions, however, around whether closing was necessary — some public health maintain that the city’s schools are safe. When is the right time for schools to reopen and what is the right threshold for closing? We explore what lessons New York City’s struggles hold for the rest of the nation. Eliza Shapiro, who covers New York City education for The New York Times, walks us through the city’s decision to reopen schools and the difficult decision to shut them down.

New York City’s public schools have closed, moving to all-remote instruction and disrupting the education of roughly 300,000 children. As schools close again, frustrated and angry parents say the decision does not make the city safer. There are a lot of ways to listen to The Daily. Here’s how. We want to hear from you.
