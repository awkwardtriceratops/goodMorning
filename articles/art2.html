By Tariq Panja Lionel Messi is still angry with Barcelona. He is still frustrated with Barcelona. But, in a sudden and dramatic reversal, he said Friday that he is not prepared to go to war with Barcelona and, so, will stay after all. In a decision he announced in an interview with the website Goal, Messi said he had withdrawn a letter announcing his intention to leave Barcelona and would stay with the soccer club that he has called home for his entire professional career. The decision is an abrupt about-face for Messi, who on Aug. 25 informed the club in writing that he would exercise a clause in his contract that allowed him to leave the club unilaterally. It also spares the team the embarrassment of losing its most beloved, and most valuable, asset without receiving a transfer fee. But it may do little to resolve months of turmoil at Barcelona, a downward spiral that has involved coaching changes, boardroom intrigue and public bickering. The club reached a nadir with a humbling 8-2 defeat at the hands of the German champion Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals of the Champions League last month. The announcement that he would stay came hours after Messi’s father and agent, Jorge, had appeared to double down on the player’s stated intention to leave, and after the Spanish league had declared a €700 million release clause in Messi’s contract was valid. That set the stage for an ugly legal fight between the player and the club, and Messi, in his interview with Goal, appeared to back away rather than face Barcelona in court. “I would never go to war against the club of my life,” Messi said. But the manner of Messi’s decision and the contentious language he used even as he confirmed his decision to stay at Barcelona piles yet more pressure on the club’s embattled president Josep Maria Bartomeu. Messi said Bartomeu, already under pressure because of a spate of ugly boardroom dramas, reneged on a promise to let him leave at the end of last season. “I wasn’t happy and I wanted to leave,” Messi said in the Goal interview. “I have not been allowed this in any way and I will stay at the club so as not to get into a legal dispute. The management of the club led by Bartomeu is a disaster.” He added: “I thought and was sure that I was free to leave; the president always said that at the end of the season I could decide if I stayed or not. Now they cling to the fact that I did not say it before June 10, when it turns out that on June 10 we were competing for La Liga in the middle of this awful coronavirus and this disease altered all the season.” It is not the first time Messi has reversed course. The forward caused hysteria in his homeland in 2016 when he quit the national team, citing his frustration with the federation. But less than two months later, amid pleas from teammates, fans and even the country’s president, Messi changed his mind. In the current situation, Barcelona and Messi had agreed upon a clause that would allow him to walk away without commanding a transfer fee as long as he communicated his desire to leave before the end of the season. But the havoc wrought on the soccer schedule by the pandemic meant the Spanish season did not finish until months after the date stipulated in the agreement. Messi complained that Bartomeu did not keep to the spirit of the accord and insisted Messi stay unless suitors pay the full buyout clause, which Messi called “impossible.” Messi said that given his relationship with the club and its supporters he could not continence the idea of pursuing a damaging lawsuit to force his way out of the club. Instead, he will remain to help pick up the pieces as Barcelona prepares to rebuild itself after a catastrophic year on and off the field. A new coach, Ronald Koeman, has already been hired and several senior players, including Messi’s close friend Luis Suárez, have been told they have no future at the Camp Nou. Koeman, appointed in the wake of the humbling against Bayern, had spoken to Messi shortly before the player stunned the club by announcing his intention to leave. News reports in Spain at the time suggested that the new Dutch coach, a former player with Barcelona, had warned Messi that he would no longer receive special treatment — a threat, it was suggested, that made Messi more determined to leave. Instead the two will have to form an uneasy alliance for at least a year and try to shake Barcelona out of a slump that had been building in recent seasons. The surrender to the German champion came after similar capitulations in the Champions League against Roma and Liverpool in recent seasons. Messi said those failures drove his decision to seek a new challenge in the final years of his career. Messi was 28 when the team won its last European Cup.
