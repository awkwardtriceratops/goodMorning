By Ruth Graham and Frances Robles Jerry Falwell Jr., one of the most prominent evangelical supporters of President Trump, resigned on Monday from his position as president and chancellor of Liberty University, following weeks of mounting scrutiny of his private life. Mr. Falwell had been on leave since Aug. 7, after an uproar over a photograph he posted to Instagram that depicted him with his pants partially unzipped and his arm around a woman he later said was his wife’s assistant. On Monday, a business associate named Giancarlo Granda alleged in an interview with Reuters that he had regular sexual liaisons with Mr. Falwell’s wife, Becki, with Mr. Falwell looking on, after meeting the couple as a 20-year-old pool attendant at a luxury hotel in Miami in 2012. The Falwells and Mr. Granda later became business partners, with the couple offering Mr. Granda a share in a Miami youth hostel that they helped their son Trey invest $4.7 million in the next year. Mr. Falwell appeared to anticipate Mr. Granda’s interview with Reuters, issuing a statement on Sunday evening conceding that his wife engaged in an “inappropriate personal relationship” with Mr. Granda, “in which I was not involved.” In the statement, first issued to a columnist at the conservative Washington Examiner, Mr. Falwell said the pool attendant, whom he did not name, “began threatening to publicly reveal this secret relationship with Becki and to deliberately embarrass my wife, family, and Liberty University unless we agreed to pay him substantial monies.”  </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
