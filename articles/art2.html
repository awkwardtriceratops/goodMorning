By Maggie Astor As of 6 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday, six states that will decide the next president remained uncalled, as did a handful of Senate races that will determine who controls the chamber. Here’s where things stand on Day 3, when you can expect final results, and how to follow along as this extraordinary election unfolds. In the presidential race, as of 6 p.m. Eastern, we did not yet know who won Alaska (3 electoral votes), Arizona (11), Georgia (16), Nevada (6), North Carolina (15) or Pennsylvania (20). With the three calls made on Wednesday — Michigan and Wisconsin for Joseph R. Biden Jr., and Maine’s Second Congressional District for President Trump — Mr. Biden has 253 confirmed electoral votes and would need 17 more to win. President Trump has 214 confirmed electoral votes and would need 56 more to win. Four Senate races were uncalled in three states: Alaska, Georgia and North Carolina. Two other races were called on Wednesday: The Republican incumbent in Maine, Senator Susan Collins, and the Democratic incumbent in Michigan, Senator Gary Peters, both won re-election. Georgia has two races involving Republican incumbents whom Democrats hope to unseat. One, between Senator David Perdue and Jon Ossoff, is very likely to go to a runoff in January. The other race will definitely require a runoff between the incumbent, Kelly Loeffler, and Raphael Warnock, a Democrat. This will probably vary significantly from state to state. Let’s take them one at a time. Alaska may well be the last state to be called, because officials there won’t even begin counting mail ballots, or early in-person ballots cast after Oct. 29, for another week. That being said, it’s a red state and isn’t really competitive. Mr. Trump will probably win here pretty easily, and Senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican, probably will too. Arizona could be called on Thursday, but probably not until late in the day. Mr. Biden is leading by a little over two percentage points with about 86 percent of the estimated vote counted, and some news outlets, including The Associated Press and Fox News, have already called it for him. The New York Times and others have not done so. Officials in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix and where many votes are still uncounted, said they would release an update on the results after 9 p.m. Eastern. Elections officials in Georgia said they would keep counting votes throughout Thursday. The state might have been called already if not for a burst pipe at a site in Fulton County where election officials were counting absentee ballots, which delayed the counting process in and around Atlanta. Mr. Trump was ahead in Georgia by less than half a percentage point with 98 percent of the estimated vote counted, but Mr. Biden has been closing the gap, and the uncounted ballots are mostly in Democratic areas. The race could end up close enough for a recount.
