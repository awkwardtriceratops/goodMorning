But demonstrations continued, calling for the longtime president to resign. By Daniel Victor After the longtime president of Belarus, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, claimed 80 percent of the vote in what many Western governments said was a sham election in August, protesters across the country have continued to turn out in droves, only to be met with a fierce police crackdown as the government tries to maintain its grip on power. Violent clashes, which included the police spraying tear gas and making thousands of arrests, have given way to smaller demonstrations, as some protesters became fearful of police violence. But other protesters have turned more aggressive, at times throwing stones at officers. Thousands of protesters are believed to have been detained, and videos of civilians being beaten by the police continue to emerge, potentially further galvanizing public anger. One week after the Aug. 9 vote, tens of thousands of protesters — some estimates put the crowd at 200,000 — filled the center of the capital, Minsk, possibly the largest protest in the country’s history, and a sign of the growing pressure on Mr. Lukashenko to step down. But he shows no sign of doing so, even turning to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for help. As the political crisis continues in Belarus, an Eastern European nation of 9.5 million people, many opponents of Mr. Lukashenko insist they will fight on. Here are the basics on the events leading up to the protests and what happened in the bloody showdowns. Mr. Lukashenko, who has often been called “Europe’s last dictator,” was first elected in 1994 in what outside observers believed was a fair and free election, but every election since then has been disputed. In 2006, he boasted that he had publicly lowered his share of the vote — 93.5 percent — to 86 percent because the original number seemed too high. It is difficult to gauge the popularity of Mr. Lukashenko because independent polling is mostly illegal and government polls are typically kept secret. Observers believe he generally had wide support until recently, with a faltering economy and mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic among the main sources of discontent. But they never doubted that he would be declared the winner of the election as he controls the electoral system. Svetlana G. Tikhanovskaya emerged as Mr. Lukashenko’s main election rival after several other opposition leaders were jailed or exiled. They included her husband, Sergei Tikhanovsky, a blogger who was considered among the top opposition candidates before he was jailed. It was clear Mr. Lukashenko was in peril even before the election. Tens of thousands of people participated in rallies to support Ms. Tikhanovskaya before the election, the largest antigovernment demonstrations in decades. The authorities arrested 33 Russians accused of being mercenaries sent to disrupt the election in July, and Mr. Lukashenko claimed other saboteurs were targeting Belarus. “A hybrid war is going on against Belarus, and we should expect dirty tricks from any side,” he told security officials in Minsk. International election observers, who have said that past elections were neither free nor fair but were allowed to monitor them, were barred this year. The announcement that Mr. Lukashenko had won an overwhelming 80 percent of the vote was met with protests across the country, most notably in Minsk. For three nights, beginning on the night of the election, the police aggressively crushed the largely peaceful demonstrations with tear gas, stun grenades, rubber bullets and batons. Internet access and mobile phone service were largely shut down, much of the center of Minsk was cordoned off, and the police said they had detained thousands of demonstrators. Many protesters were injured, along with dozens of officers, and at least one protester died when an explosive device detonated in his hand, according to officials. The police in the southwestern city of Brest fired live rounds at protesters, injuring one, according to the Belarusian Interior Ministry. Ms. Tikhanovskaya left the country after the election, appearing in cryptic video messages that appeared to be filmed under duress. Two of her associates said the Belarusian authorities had pressured her to leave for Lithuania. Mass arrests and violence appeared to be geared at scaring people off the streets, but protests against Mr. Lukashenko continued across the country.
