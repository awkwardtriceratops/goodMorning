By Emma G. Fitzsimmons In the final weeks of the presidential race, President Trump cannot seem to stop harping on New York City. He wrote on Twitter that his hometown had “gone to hell.” He said on Fox News this week that the city was in such despair that he might win the state in November — despite polls showing that he is far behind. And in both debates against Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump referred to New York as a ghost town. “Look at what’s happened to New York, it’s a ghost town. It’s a ghost town,” he said at the debate on Thursday night. “For so many years I loved it, it was vibrant. It’s dying, everyone is leaving New York.” Mr. Trump’s antagonistic stance lies in stark contrast to Mr. Biden, the former vice president who has made his home state of Delaware a central part of his narrative, referring to it several times during Thursday’s debate. But for the president, belittling New York seems to serve two purposes: It appeals to his base as a campaign strategy, and allows him to address personal scores with his foes. While many New Yorkers feel that Mr. Trump has turned his back on the city, the feeling is mutual with Mr. Trump. The city overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. There were protests when he returned to Trump Tower. His name was stripped from skyscrapers. Democratic prosecutors in New York are digging into his family’s finances, and Democratic leaders, like Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, frequently accuse him of betraying his hometown. Mr. Cuomo recently accused the president of “actively trying to kill New York City ever since he was elected.” Representative Peter T. King, who is close with Mr. Trump, says the city serves as a useful foil for the president for “what happens when liberals take over.” “If he wants to have a punching bag that plays with the rest of the country, New York City is the perfect target,” he said. “You see the boarded-up buildings, you see the dramatic increases in crime, you see people leaving for the Hamptons.” Mr. Trump, however, has not seen much of the city’s problems firsthand: The only visit he made to the city this year was to see his ailing brother before his death in August. Despite his absence, his aides said that Mr. Trump was still proud of being from New York, even noting that the president interrupted Mr. Biden during Thursday’s debate to say that he was born in Queens. “President Trump loves New York City and, as you heard last night, is proud to be from Queens,” Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that also included many of Mr. Trump’s grievances, including “draconian shutdowns” and high taxes. “This is a failure of state and local leadership, and this president is not going to let what is happening to New York and many other places happen to the rest of the country,” he added. Indeed, the president last month labeled the city an “anarchist jurisdiction” and threatened to slash its funding. But he has also rejected initiatives that would benefit New York. He refused to support a project to build a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River; he punished the city as a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants; and he made it more difficult for New Yorkers to fly at airports in a fight over driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants. The president is now balking at granting New York more coronavirus recovery funds, despite entreaties from Mr. King to reconsider. But the constant taunting from Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio — including painting “Black Lives Matter” on the street in front of Trump Tower — does not help, Mr. King said. They could play nice, he suggested, or “at least tone it down.” At this juncture, playing nice would likely have little effect: Mr. Trump seems to regard his hometown with such acrimony that his decision to officially move his residency to Florida last year served as a de facto finalization of divorce papers. Anthony Scaramucci, a former White House communications director under Mr. Trump, says the president views his attacks as “red meat” for voters who resent East Coast elites.
