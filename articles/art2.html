By Geoffrey Kabaservice Mr. Kabaservice is the author of “Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party.” President Trump has flirted with the convoluted QAnon conspiracy theory for months. Last week, he gave a full embrace to its followers, telling reporters that its believers are patriots “who love our country.” Over 70 QAnon supporters have run for Congress as Republicans this year. At least one of them, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, will probably join the House next year. Despite her QAnon advocacy and a history of racist and Islamophobic rants on social media, Mr. Trump hailed her as a “future Republican star.” Most people refer to QAnon as a fringe movement. But that no longer makes sense: Under Mr. Trump, it has become part of the Republican mainstream — and that has troubling implications for the party’s future. The QAnon movement routinely deploys racist and anti-Semitic tropes; it has even been identified as a potential domestic terrorism threat by the F.B.I. Yet a majority of Republican leaders have refrained from criticizing the president for legitimizing it. They do not seem bothered that the conspiracists, without a shred of proof, declare Democrats to be part of a “deep state” cabal of satanic, child-molesting cannibals and call for the president to imprison and execute them. A handful of the least Trump-dependent Republicans have pushed back. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming called QAnon “dangerous lunacy that should have no place in American politics.” Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois termed it “a fabrication.” (For that, a Trump campaign official actually attacked him.) Past Republican leaders knew better than to allow the pathogens of extreme conspiracy theories to infect the political bloodstream. The conservative movement that now dominates the party always had a dark side, but its leaders understood that conspiracy cults are lethal to the social trust on which democracy depends. They also realized it was in the best interest of their movement to marginalize its cranks and kooks. QAnon presents the same kind of threat to the Republican Party that the far-right John Birch Society did in the late 1950s and ’60s. The Birchers trafficked in similar concepts of an evil elite corrupting and betraying the country. The society’s founder, the retired candy-maker Robert Welch, considered even President Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, to be “a conscious, dedicated” Communist agent.
