Will It Be Enough for Him?<br></h1><p id="artcont">Polls suggest some retirees are shifting from having supported President Trump to voting for Joseph R. Biden Jr. But they are rare in Florida’s Republican heartland. By Patricia Mazzei FORT MYERS, Fla. — For Joseph R. Biden Jr. to capture Florida, he would need a lot of voters like Dave Niederkorn, a retired businessman who cast his ballot for President Trump four years ago and soon came to regret it. And like Gerry Miller, a retiree who wrote in his own name for president in 2016 to protest the choice between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton and is appalled by how Mr. Trump has handled the coronavirus pandemic. Both say they voted for Mr. Biden in the unlikeliest of places: Southwest Florida, a Republican bastion that has helped elect Republican candidates in election after election and was pivotal for Mr. Trump in 2016. Switch voters know that they are rare finds, though they have recently shown up in polling and sporadic interviews. Whether Florida’s older voters will shift away from the president in large numbers remains unknown, in a state filled with many unknowns. Even if only some retirees change allegiances to vote for Mr. Biden, that could be enough to swing Florida, which is why that prospect is so tantalizing for Democrats and a subject of fixation for the two candidates. But while siphoning off older voters from Mr. Trump is viewed as perhaps the best path to victory for Mr. Biden in Florida, the enthusiasm for the president in Fort Myers shows how difficult that feat might be. In 2016, Mr. Trump won Lee County, home to Fort Myers, and Collier County to the south, home to Naples, by formidable double-digit margins. On a recent weekday morning, the line at a downtown early voting site popular with retirees was between 60 and 90 minutes long, with nearly every person willing to be interviewed saying they had voted for Mr. Trump. Four years ago, David Allgood, 60, briefly hesitated before voting for Mr. Trump “because he was an unknown quantity,” he said after casting his vote in a strip mall next to a Robb & Stucky furniture store. Now? “I’m a Trump man,” Mr. Allgood said. Older voters make up a crucial electoral demographic in Florida, where more than a quarter of the population is over the age of 60. National and state polls show that Mr. Biden has made inroads with them, including with voters age 65 and older, who typically vote Republican. Especially notable are older Floridians who skipped the last presidential election but have cast ballots this year. New voters tend to be younger. But this year, more Florida voters age 65 and older who did not vote in 2016 have voted than new voters age 30 and younger, “which is just wild,” said Tom Bonier, the chief executive of TargetSmart, a Democratic data firm. Those older voters tended to be registered Democratic, Mr. Bonier said. “We generally don’t think of senior voters as a surge group,” Mr. Bonier said. “There are a lot of seniors in Florida who stayed home in 2016 — for whatever reason, I’m not even sure what to attribute it to — but we’re seeing them come out now.” In Southwest Florida, older voters who have shifted to Mr. Biden are not keen on advertising their views to neighbors, friends and family who still stand by the president. “I probably have friends of mine that wouldn’t speak to me again,” said Mr. Miller, 71, who lives with his wife in a beachfront condo in Naples. Mr. Miller, a retiree from Wisconsin who considers himself a moderate Republican, said he could not bring himself to vote for Mr. Trump in 2016. “I knew what he was — it didn’t take a rocket scientist,” he said. This year, the pandemic crystallized his decision to vote for a Democrat for president for the first time. “He’s not a national leader,’’ he said of Mr. Trump, “and he’s not a strategic thinker, and at the time that the country needs strong leadership, in probably the worst crisis that we’ve experienced since World War II, his leadership has absolutely failed. For me, at 71, it’s stealing a lot of the percentage of my remaining life.” Mr. Niederkorn, a 77-year-old widower, lives with his dog, Roscoe, in a gated retirement community in Estero, about 20 miles south of Fort Myers. He voted for Mr. Trump with reservations in 2016. But his disgust with Mr. Trump built quickly, especially over family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border and during the pandemic. He said he had stopped talking to a good friend because they disagreed over politics. Now, he is a registered Democrat. “When the coronavirus hit, he turned it all over to the governors, and I thought that was the stupidest thing,” he said of Mr. Trump. “That’s why you have the federal government. But no, he went, ‘That’s not my job,’ and he sends it out to the governors. To me, that was just totally unforgivable.”
