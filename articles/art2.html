By Remy Tumin and Merrill D. Oliver (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The postmaster general told lawmakers that the largest vote-by-mail push in American history would be delivered “fully and on time.” Testifying before Congress for the first time amid a political firestorm, Louis DeJoy, a major donor to President Trump, called suggestions that he might intentionally slow ballot delivery to help the president “outrageous.” But he was unable to offer many specifics about how the Postal Service would ensure on-time delivery of ballots, and said that a plan was still being drafted. And worries about the integrity of the November election have reached social media companies: Facebook is laying out contingency plans in case Mr. Trump tries to delegitimize election results, including a political ad “kill switch.” 2. After nearly five decades in national politics, Joe Biden met his moment. Mr. Biden formally accepted his party’s nomination with one of the most forceful speeches of his career, our politics reporter Katie Glueck writes. The address capped four nights of a virtual Democratic convention that showcased a party unified around Mr. Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris. Here are key takeaways and a fact check from the convention. Mr. Biden offered a new image for the next four years, our TV critic writes: Goodbye Uncle Joe, “hello, father of the nation.” President Trump, meanwhile, called the Democratic convention the “darkest and angriest and gloomiest” in the country’s history. Republicans are gearing up to renominate Mr. Trump at the Republican National Convention next week, which kicks off with an in-person roll call on Monday in Charlotte, N.C. 3. Europe is bracing for a new phase of the pandemic. In recent days, France, Germany and Italy have experienced their highest daily case counts of the coronavirus since the spring. Spain is also in the midst of a major outbreak. Fears are growing that the end of summer travel season will bring a new wave of infections. Above, Rome this week. Worried that citizens would not tolerate more draconian measures, European leaders have largely avoided imposing widespread lockdowns, opting instead for a localized strategy that relies on measures like targeted movement restrictions and increased mask requirements.
