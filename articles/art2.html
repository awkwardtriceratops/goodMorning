But the company has made most of its impact in just one country: China. By Raymond Zhong One of China’s most influential tech companies, the internet finance titan Ant Group, is poised to raise a boatload of cash by selling shares. The sale puts another stamp on China’s importance as a digital powerhouse. But it also shows how the tech world is fracturing. The company could be worth more than many global banks after its share sale, yet its business is highly concentrated in just one country: China. Instead of listing in New York, as many other Chinese internet companies have done, Ant is going public in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Here’s what to know about the company and its initial public offering. Around the turn of the millennium, the internet was a lawless frontier, not least in China. Online shopping was a gamble. Buying and selling took place largely between strangers. Nobody could be sure they weren’t being defrauded. Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce group, had an idea for cultivating trust. In 2003, it created a service called Alipay that held on to payments until buyers confirmed that they were satisfied with their purchases. If the items were fake or never arrived, the money was refunded. Alipay helped Alibaba’s bazaars take off. Jack Ma, Alibaba’s co-founder, spun the service out in 2011 as a separate company, setting off a tiff with Yahoo, which was then a major Alibaba investor. Today, Alibaba owns a one-third stake in Ant. Mr. Ma is Ant’s controlling shareholder, though he is not part of its management.
