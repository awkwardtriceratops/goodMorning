By Michael Wilson The police chief of Rochester, N.Y., resigned on Tuesday in the aftermath of the death of a Black man who suffocated after he had been placed in a hood by city police officers and pinned to the ground. The resignation of the police chief, La’Ron D. Singletary, came three days after the state attorney general, Letitia James, announced that she would set up a grand jury to consider evidence in the death of the man, Daniel Prude. “As a man of integrity, I will not sit idly by while outside entities attempt to destroy my character,” the police chief said in a statement. He later added: “The mischaracterization and the politicization of the actions that I took after being informed of Mr. Prude’s death is not based on facts, and is not what I stand for.” Officials in Rochester had not publicly disclosed the death of Mr. Prude, 41, until a public records request by his family ended months of official silence. Mr. Prude’s family in recent days has accused officials of covering up his death to protect the police officers involved. Mr. Singletary denied any wrongdoing on the part of the officers involved, even as seven were suspended last week. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
