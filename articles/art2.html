So why aren’t more girls from conservative Christian traditions encouraged to be like her? By Katelyn Beaty Ms. Beaty is a writer. In the Christian tradition, icons are meant to remind flawed humans of what they could become. Paintings of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and the saints remind the devout to aspire to holiness and sacrifice in their daily lives. Meditating on an icon can be a form of prayer: Lord, make me more like them. Amy Coney Barrett, whose Supreme Court confirmation hearing began Monday, is a living icon for conservative Christian women. Judge Barrett has combined the dual pathways of motherhood and career into one, showing that both can be holy vocations. Her judicial record holds out the renewed possibility of a conservative Supreme Court majority for decades; her role as a mother of seven, including two adopted children and one with special needs, is a testament to the ways her pro-life views bear out in her personal life. Since President Trump announced his plan to nominate Judge Barrett, many conservative Christians have thrilled at the possibility of her symbolic power in the culture wars. Anti-abortion groups such as Concerned Women for America and the Susan B. Anthony List are campaigning on her behalf, while Senators Josh Hawley, Marco Rubio and Ben Sasse have defended her faith against what they see to be anti-Christian bias. To her champions, Judge Barrett represents a new form of feminine strength — living proof that women are strong enough to have both a career and children, and that abortion may in the end primarily serve to let both men (sexual partners) and The Man (discriminatory workplaces) off the hook when it comes to pursuing true gender equity. So it’s worth asking: If Judge Barrett’s Catholic faith and indisputable career accomplishments make her such a young heroine of the Christian right, why doesn’t the traditional Christianity to which she adheres encourage more women to be like her?
