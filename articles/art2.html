That’s ironic, maybe, for a holiday meant to show that we’re not afraid of death. But there you have it. We’re afraid of death. If you want to celebrate anyway, maybe read a spooky book? We have a full complement on offer this week, from John Banville’s novel “Snow,” about the murder of a priest in Ireland, to Chloe Hooper’s “The Arsonist,” about a wildfire that ravaged Australia in 2009. There’s Alice Hoffman’s new novel, “Magic Lessons,” which revisits the family of witches she introduced in “Practical Magic,” and P. Djèlí Clark’s “Ring Shout,” which imagines the Ku Klux Klan as a kind of demonic force summoned from another dimension, and Hiroko Oyamada’s “The Hole,” about a woman who drops into a surreal dreamscape. And much else besides — including Reeves Wiedeman’s “Billion Dollar Loser,” a journalistic narrative that frames the collapse of the start-up darling WeWork as a symbol of heedless capitalist bluster and excess. Now that’s scary. Gregory Cowles

Twitter: @GregoryCowles WHAT BECOMES A LEGEND MOST: A Biography of Richard Avedon, by Philip Gefter. (Harper/HarperCollins Publishers, $35.) Richard Avedon’s first fashion photograph appeared in Harper’s Bazaar in 1944, when he was 21, and he was still shooting for The New Yorker at the time of his death 60 years later. “He knew everyone and photographed everyone, and part of the pleasure of this biography lies in watching life’s rich pageant pass by,” our critic Dwight Garner writes, calling the book “wise and ebullient.” Gefter lingers over photo sessions with subjects like Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin and James Baldwin, and makes the case for Avedon as one of the 20th century’s most consequential artists. INSIDE STORY, by Martin Amis. (Knopf, $28.95.) In this “novelized autobiography” — an unstable and charismatic compound of fact and fiction — Martin Amis writes about three writers beloved to him: Philip Larkin, Saul Bellow and Christopher Hitchens. The book revisits stories he told in his memoir “Experience,” and some passages are familiar from his essays and speeches. But in his writing about Hitchens, Amis “moves into a fresh register,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes, and “accesses a depth of feeling and a plainness of language entirely new to his work.” BILLION DOLLAR LOSER: The Epic Rise and Spectacular Fall of Adam Neumann and WeWork, by Reeves Wiedeman. (Little, Brown, $28.) Emerging in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, WeWork repurposed office space for freelancers worldwide, rebranding precarity into community. In a spectacular fall in 2019, it postponed its initial public offering and co-founder Adam Neumann left the company. “‘Billion Dollar Loser’ would be absorbing enough were it just about one man’s grandiosity, but Wiedeman has a larger argument to make about what Neumann represents,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. “Wiedeman depicts the giant sums of money churning through WeWork as the embodiment of a confidence game that flourished in the last decade.” EARTHLINGS, by Sayaka Murata. Translated by Ginny Tapley Takemori. (Grove, $26.) In the Japanese author’s second novel, two cousins agree that they’re aliens, abandoned at birth among humans. After the traumas of childhood, in adulthood they seek to abandon society — a.k.a. “the Baby Factory” — altogether, in favor of a moral vacuum. “In ‘Earthlings,’ being an alien is a simple proxy for being alienated,” Lydia Millet writes in her review. “Their mission becomes the achievement of a more perfect detachment: They wish to divest themselves of all learned norms and strictures.” SNOW, by John Banville. (Hanover Square, $27.99.) This rich thriller set in 1950s Ireland begins with the murder of a priest and unfolds in the manner of a classic crime novel by Banville’s alter ego, Benjamin Black. A detective sets out to find the culprit among members of an Anglo-Irish family, and unearths a snake pit of secrets in the process. “Time and again, Banville sets up and then deftly demolishes the Agatha Christie format he seems to be aping,” William Boyd writes in his review. “Everything that seems creakingly familiar about the country-house murder turns out to be darker and darker still.” Banville, Boyd adds, “is one of the great stylists of fiction in English and ‘Snow’ allows the limpid cadences of his prose free rein.”
