He Rode It to the Nomination.<br></h1><p id="artcont">POLITICAL MEMO Joseph R. Biden Jr. never wavered from his central message: that President Trump was a danger to American democracy, while he was a stable, experienced leader. Now it will be tested in a fierce battle with the president. By Jonathan Martin Staring into the camera, Joseph R. Biden Jr. recalled the white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, Va., declared that the soul of the nation was at stake in this election and, invoking America’s founding creed, claimed history’s call by vowing to defeat a president who he said threatens democracy itself. That’s how Mr. Biden accepted his party’s nomination at the conclusion of the Democratic convention Thursday night. But it’s also how he announced his candidacy, in a three-and-a-half minute video in April of last year. In the intervening months, Mr. Biden was occasionally thrown off balance — by attacks on his son Hunter’s work in Ukraine; questions about his antiquated cultural references and gaffe-prone speaking style; and laments that his politics were as dated as some of his favorite sayings. But he never wavered from his central message: that President Trump was a danger to American values, while he was a stable, experienced leader who represented his party’s strongest option for the general election. Nor did he succumb to the purity tests on policy that coursed through the Democratic field during the 2020 primary season. “A lot of smart Democratic strategists overcomplicated things,” said Elisabeth Smith, who was a top aide to Pete Buttigieg’s campaign, noting that most anti-Trump voters are animated chiefly by the burning desire to defeat him. Referring to Mr. Biden, she said, “Because of the way he conducted himself in primary, not kowtowing to every demand from the left, he never had to pivot from a primary to a general election message.” On Friday, Democrats were celebrating a mostly glitch-free convention, happy with Mr. Biden’s performance, many convinced of his theory of the case. As he enters the fall, his relative consistency — the through line from announcement video to acceptance speech — illustrates why he captured his party’s nomination after initial stumbles, and why he has maintained a steady lead in the polls over Mr. Trump. Whether that’s sufficient for victory in November will now be tested by the president and his allies, who will take center stage next week at a convention that will be conducted in part from the White House. Mr. Trump has relentlessly attacked Mr. Biden and Democrats in recent months, and he continued the assault on Friday, calling the Democratic convention the “darkest and angriest and gloomiest” in the country’s history. It was an oddly discordant message for a president who himself regularly delivers exaggerated portraits of carnage in American cities and dark predictions of calamity under Democrats. Even on Friday Mr. Trump quickly pivoted to say that, if he’s not re-elected, “no one will be safe in our country,” and called himself “the only thing standing between the American dream and total anarchy, madness and chaos.” It was only the latest example of how Mr. Trump has struggled to settle on a single message against Mr. Biden. In contrast to Mr. Biden’s relatively disciplined, 16-month campaign against him, Mr. Trump has at times portrayed his rival as an overly close ally to China, a political lifer beholden to Washington’s status quo, a radical liberal and a doddering old man. Since the president’s installation of a new, more experienced campaign manager, Bill Stepien, his scripted remarks and advertising have steadied. Mr. Trump has caricatured Mr. Biden as being a tool of his party’s extremists, if not one himself, and highlighted the spasm of rioting in some cities to try to gain back some wavering Republicans in the polls. When the election cycle began it wasn’t clear Mr. Biden’s strategy would work. At times the consensus-minded Mr. Biden seemed out of sync with a party that was steadily moving left. He was naïve to believe that voters only wanted a return to normalcy and was overly fixated on Mr. Trump — at least that’s what his legion of intraparty critics said. But by the time the convention began this week, Senator Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist, had rallied to him because he shared Mr. Biden’s alarm over Mr. Trump. So too did a bevy of Republicans who praised Mr. Biden, denounced Mr. Trump and gave tacit permission for Republican-leaning independents and even some G.O.P. voters to support a Democrat. From the start, the 77-year-old former vice president and his advisers had a better feel for the Democratic primary electorate than their skeptics, or their rivals. Mr. Biden himself never put it this way, but the case for his candidacy was clear enough from hundreds of conversations with voters: he’s a decent man who was a loyal lieutenant to President Obama, has suffered some tough knocks along the way and has the best chance to end this turbulent period by defeating Mr. Trump. “Biden understood how much good will there still was for Obama,” said Ms. Smith, contrasting him with those Democrats who “were hitting Obama from the left.” In the primary, Mr. Biden declined to join his competitors who called for decriminalizing the border and eliminating private health insurance, not wanting to give away his party’s advantage on two issues — immigration and health care — that lifted them to success in the 2018 midterms.
