Gore<br></h1><p id="artcont">After two decades of legal obscurity, the ruling that handed the 2000 election to George W. Bush is getting fresh attention. By Adam Liptak WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court’s decision in Bush v. Gore 20 years ago was supposed to work like the tape recorder in “Mission: Impossible.” It was meant to produce a president and then self-destruct. “Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances,” the majority wrote. In other words: The decision was a ticket for one ride only, handing the presidency to George W. Bush and then disappearing. In the two decades that followed, only a single Supreme Court opinion ever cited the case, and that was a passing reference in a footnote to a 2013 dissent from Justice Clarence Thomas. On Monday, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh breathed new life into the decision, which on December 12, 2000 shut down a recount in Florida ordered by the state Supreme Court. He said the decision could play a role in deciding an election dispute now before the court and other potential challenges to election rulings from state courts. Justice Kavanaugh’s remarks came in a concurring opinion explaining why the court, by a 5-to-3 vote, had been right to refuse to extend a deadline for counting absentee ballots in Wisconsin. Federal judges, he wrote, should not change state voting rules close to elections. Then, in a long footnote, Justice Kavanaugh addressed a different question, one not before the court. Citing Bush v. Gore, he said federal courts do have a role to play in supervising state courts in some election disputes. Ordinarily state Supreme Courts have the last word on issues of state law. “As Chief Justice Rehnquist persuasively explained in Bush v. Gore,” Justice Kavanaugh wrote, referring to a concurring opinion in that case, “the text of the Constitution requires federal courts to ensure that state courts do not rewrite state election laws.” “This is the most full-throated defense of the independent state legislative doctrine that we’ve had from the Supreme Court since the concurrence of Bush v. Gore,” said Nathaniel Persily, a law professor and political scientist at Stanford. “What that presages for postelection litigation this year is that in the event there is conflict with state courts and state legislatures, there are several justices on the Supreme Court who are leaning toward the legislatures.” That would seem to benefit of Republicans in November, should any conflicts arise. Republicans control the state legislatures in many if not all of the major battleground states, including Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, Iowa, Texas and North Carolina. Justice Kavanaugh’s view has not been widely accepted. Even in Bush v. Gore, it commanded only three votes, those of Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. The other members of the majority, Justices Sandra Day O’Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy, did not join the chief justice’s concurrence. The unsigned majority opinion relied on equal protection principles and contained the admonition that it was “limited to the present circumstances.” In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote: “When questions arise about the meaning of state laws, including election laws, it is our settled practice to accept the opinions of the highest courts of the States as providing the final answers. On rare occasions, however, either federal statutes or the federal Constitution may require federal judicial intervention in state elections. This is not such an occasion.”
