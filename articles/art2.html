To the Editor: Re “Key States Up for Grabs as Trump-Biden Battle Extends Late Into Night” (front page, Nov. 4): A blue wave. A landslide victory for Joe Biden. As Election Day came to a close, I quickly came to terms with the reality that neither was going to happen. Perhaps the most devastating reality was that so many Americans really love President Trump. So many of my fellow citizens found his lies, his braggadocio, his handling of the virus, his attack on those who dared to contradict him, his abusiveness totally acceptable, even admirable. Are my values, my morals, my ideals, my respect for my fellow man no longer in vogue? Is my hope for a greener tomorrow out of date? Do Black lives really matter? Does the Constitution still uphold freedom and justice?
