By Kate Taylor As a third wave of coronavirus infections has begun to take off across much of the country, San Francisco has been a bright spot. After experiencing a surge of cases over the summer, the city has tamped down infections to near their lowest levels since the pandemic began. Restaurants, movie theaters, and museums are open at 25 percent of capacity. One crucial part of the city, however, remains stubbornly closed: The public schools. Even as private and parochial schools have begun to reopen their doors, the school district has not set a timeline for resuming in-person instruction, except to say that it is not likely in this calendar year. The district’s decision to stay closed this fall, even as other urban districts — including New York City, Miami, Washington D.C., and Philadelphia — have opened or set dates for partially reopening, has angered many parents, local health experts and the mayor, London Breed, who does not control the school system. It has also touched off, in this very politically progressive city, a sharp debate about how best to safely educate low-income and minority students during the pandemic — and over who speaks for the Asian, Latino and Black families who together represent a majority of the district. That debate is underway in other cities where schools have been slow to reopen. In some places, like Los Angeles and Chicago, school buildings remain closed partly because virus cases remain high in the city. In others, like Oakland, teachers’ unions have said that their members do not want to return to classrooms until there is essentially no local transmission. The frustration in San Francisco boiled over last month when district administrators told the principals of roughly one-third of the district’s 125 public schools that their communities should start brainstorming new names for their schools, because their current names had historical associations with slavery, genocide, colonization or other injustices. The list included schools named for Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and even the state’s senior U.S. senator, Dianne Feinstein. The news prompted a scathing statement from Mayor Breed, who said it was offensive for the district to be focusing energy on renaming schools when it has not put forward a plan for reopening them. The district’s 52,000 students have been taking all their classes remotely since school resumed. “I had had it, honestly,” Ms. Breed said in an interview on Oct. 22. “From my perspective, they weren’t providing clarity about one of the most important things to kids and families in this city.” While the district was talking about seeking equity by renaming schools, she said, “the achievement gap is growing, and there are kids who live in poverty who are falling behind.”
