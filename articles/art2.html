To the Editor: Re “Trump Won’t Commit to Peaceful Transfer of Power” (news article, Sept. 24): Over the last four years, Donald Trump has redrawn the lines of decency, statesmanship and altruism so that now the page is blank, devoid of moral red lines that shouldn’t be crossed. He is pushing us to the brink by deliberately declaring: “There won’t be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation.” Listen to him! Defy him! He is testing America’s response. If there isn’t a loud mass response decrying his willful rejection of the Constitution and our legal voting rights, we give him the go-ahead to carry out his plan. This is the time to protest, to yell “not on our watch,” for newspaper headlines to shriek about the danger, for us to get out in the streets and stop him and his accomplices. This is not the time to politely urge the better angels of Republican senators to show themselves. They tore off their angel wings four years ago. Rage now, or it will be too late! Shelley Binder
New York To the Editor: Donald Trump once again refuses to commit to our democratic election process as, for example, he dismisses ballots, strangles the post office and stokes white supremacist violence. He continues to fuel Covid-19 deaths by arguing from his bully pulpit against what scientists and governments worldwide recommend. No one or nothing has stopped him from tearing apart our democracy and national security. With unrelenting lies and lawbreaking, he makes the Justice Department and other agencies his own. He puts our national security at risk interacting with Vladimir Putin, cuddling up to other dictators, breaking alliances, and denigrating our military and entities designed to protect us. Where is the leadership wall to stop assaults against the national health and welfare? Many people and groups have spoken out. Retired generals (trained for leadership) could create a coalition of Vote Vets. Republicans for Biden and nonpartisan groups promoting democracy could press the president to resign, since he won’t accept an election loss. Judith Lynne Hanna

 To the Editor: It doesn’t matter whether Donald Trump commits to a peaceful post-election transfer of power: it’s not his decision to make. Last time I checked, the United States was not a banana republic. (Although that may change, if reporters and editors don’t stop playing into this would-be dictator’s hands.) Linda Whitener
Charlotte, N.C. To the Editor: Re “Trump Won’t Commit to Peaceful Transfer of Power”: And if he did commit himself, could we believe him? Should we? Ruby Baresch
New York To the Editor: Re “Republicans Insist There Will Be a Peaceful Transfer of Power, as Democrats Decry Trump’s Refusal to Commit to One” (nytimes.com, Sept. 24): “The winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th,” Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, wrote on Twitter early Thursday. “There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792.” Of course. That’s what Senator McConnell says now, but that could change on Nov. 3. Or 4. Or whatever date is convenient for him to say “but things are different now.” Sandra Sizer
Boston To the Editor: I am confident that the Secret Service at noon on Inauguration Day will be able to detect anyone at the White House falsely posing as president of the United States. Terry L. Meyers
