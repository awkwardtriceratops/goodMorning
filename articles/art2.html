At age 81, she has spent the last 60 years or so thinking about “how important one line can be,” she told me when I arrived at her Long Island studio on a Saturday morning in August. She was eager to discuss her paintings and her career, especially her exhibition at the Menil Collection in Houston, “Virginia Jaramillo: The Curvilinear Paintings, 1969—1974,” on view from Sept. 26 to July 3. The Menil show is Ms. Jaramillo’s first solo museum show. Ever. In the roomy studio, attached to her split-level house, were some of her lines in action. She had been working on a large, rectangular painting, “Quantum Entanglement,” in which thin, wavy marks in bright colors reach out from a hazy area on each side of a black background and then jumble together in the middle. “It’s a scientific theory about two particles in space that interact,” she said, explaining the title. “No matter how far away they are in a galaxy, they can still relate to one another. It could be one one-hundredth of a second, but there’s still a vibrancy.” Ms. Jaramillo (pronounced hara-ME-oh) has vibrancy to spare. She laughs and swears easily, and she had put out some nuts and some chocolate doughnuts for me. We had our masks on, but she didn’t seem overly concerned about an in-person interview during a pandemic. The Menil exhibition has just eight paintings but it demonstrates her ability to squeeze impact out of a deceptively simple composition. “Green Dawn” (1970), for instance, is a verdant rectangle with just one thin, wavy yellow line that seems to be wandering away from the upper right corner. “That little line is off on a journey — but it changes its mind, it’s a flirt,” said Kellie Jones, a professor of art history and archaeology at Columbia University who helped give Ms. Jaramillo a career boost in 2011. Ms. Jones included Ms. Jaramillo in the show “Now Dig This!: Art and Black Los Angeles, 1960—1980,” at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles. Within abstraction, Ms. Jaramillo has experimented and evolved, spending more than a decade making works on paper and then coming back around to painting. Her adroitness with her materials was, and remains, keen; a reviewer wrote in The New York Times in 1984 that she was able to use “paper’s natural absorbency to develop subtle forms that the eye just barely grasps.” Over the years, she has moved toward using brighter, more varied colors that offer multiple entry points for viewers. Her art began as an experiment in color blocking, the pairing of contrasting tones, and it got even leaner as she went along. “I just kept simplifying, simplifying,” she said. “I dropped the form and kept the line.” The curvilinear works in the Menil show are a hinge point of sorts. “They represent a breakthrough for her, and set the stage for her works to come,” said Michelle White, the museum’s curator, who organized the show. The paintings start to emphasize negative space, fueled by Ms. Jaramillo’s growing interest in Japanese art. Ms. Jaramillo’s New York dealer, Hales Gallery in Chelsea, also has a show of 10 of her paintings from the 1970s and ’80s, “Conflux,” on view through Oct. 31. To question why has it taken so long for Ms. Jaramillo to get this level of attention is to wonder whether she has faced discrimination as a Latina artist. Ms. Jaramillo didn’t flinch. She raised her hand and said, “Yeah, hi!” “A lot of people say, ‘Oh, wow, I never knew that you did this kind of work,’ ” Ms. Jaramillo told me. “I say, ‘Where have you been?’ ” “A lot of people my age would have thrown in the sponge by now!” she added, laughing so heartily that she lurched forward. “It’s very serious, so all you can do is laugh.” Ms. Jaramillo was born in El Paso, Texas, but her parents moved to Los Angeles when she was 2. When she was 11, her father, a truck driver, gave her a drawing how-to book. He wanted to encourage her talent and he also gave her a piece of advice: “Never be ashamed of your heritage.” Ms. Jaramillo said that growing up in a multicultural part of East Los Angeles — where white, Latino and Japanese residents mixed — gave her the confidence to pull from any art tradition she liked. Her biggest early influences were the Abstract Expressionists Clyfford Still and Barnett Newman, and the designer Charles Eames; later, in the 1970s, she was wowed by Mexican muralists, especially David Alfaro Siqueiros. She attended Otis Art Institute (now the Otis College of Art and Design) with a student whom she had met in a high school art class, Daniel LaRue Johnson; they married in 1960. Mr. Johnson, who was also an accomplished abstract artist, died in 2017. In her 20s, Ms. Jaramillo was the early success story of her circle. “In our age group, she was the first one to make significant public progress,” said the sculptor Melvin Edwards, a longtime friend, referring to a Ford Foundation purchase grant she got in 1962. “She’s a fine painter,” Mr. Edwards added. “She was always quiet, strong, subtle and profound.” A 1965 trip to Paris was formative for Ms. Jaramillo and Mr. Johnson. “That was the opening of my consciousness, aesthetically,” Ms. Jaramillo said. They decided to move to New York, where they lived for 45 years, mostly in SoHo.
