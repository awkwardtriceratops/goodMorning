Not Even His Family Is Happy.<br></h1><p id="artcont">The coronavirus was an opportunity for the Treasury secretary to redefine his legacy, for better or worse. By James B. Stewart and Alan Rappeport One spring day, not long after President Trump signed the largest economic stimulus package in American history in March, a group of his top aides and cabinet officers gathered in the Oval Office. The $2.2 trillion government rescue — which delivered cash to individuals, small businesses and giant companies — was a crucial victory for Mr. Trump, who was facing withering attacks for his failures to respond to the fast-spreading coronavirus. It also was a much-needed win for the program’s chief architect, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. He didn’t have a lot of fans. The president ran hot and cold on him. Conservatives distrusted him as a Republican in Name Only. Liberals demonized him as a plutocrat. Even members of Mr. Mnuchin’s immediate family distanced themselves; his liberal father said he was appalled by his son’s politics. When the pandemic hit, the task of saving the economy was an opportunity for Mr. Mnuchin to transform himself from an unremarkable Treasury secretary into a national hero. Mr. Mnuchin, a former banker and film financier, sought advice from his former Goldman Sachs colleagues, a cable-TV host, a Hollywood superagent, a disgraced Wall Street tycoon and Newt Gingrich. Unburdened by his own ideology and with a detail-disoriented boss, Mr. Mnuchin worked with Democrats to devise and pass the landmark stimulus bill. Afterward, Mr. Trump hailed Mr. Mnuchin as a “great” Treasury secretary and “fantastic guy.” The acclaim didn’t last. Republicans argued that Mr. Mnuchin had been outfoxed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the embodiment of free-spending liberals and, in Mr. Trump’s words, “a sick woman” with “mental problems.” The conservative critique began to resonate with the president. Thanks to the stimulus package, the economy had stabilized, but it was still on life support. Millions continued to lose their jobs. More help was needed. Was Mr. Mnuchin’s initial bipartisan success a fluke, or would he be able to save the American economy again? The omens were bad. That spring day in the Oval Office, the president was venting about the stimulus package. “I never should have signed it,” Mr. Trump bellowed, according to someone who was there. He pointed at his Treasury secretary. “You’re to blame.” Mr. Mnuchin is the rare cabinet secretary who does not seem to have strong political beliefs. “I don’t know if Steve is a Republican or Democrat,” said Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser. “I do know he’s smart and a hard worker.” Mr. Trump has told people that he suspects that, deep down, Mr. Mnuchin is a Democrat. (Mr. Mnuchin has said he has always been a registered Republican. Still, he donated to Kamala Harris’s Senate campaign in 2016.) Mr. Mnuchin attended Yale. He was publisher of The Yale Daily News during the 1983-84 school year. A fan of the “objectivist” novelist Ayn Rand, he showed little interest in journalism or the causes of the day. What he cared about was turning a profit. Mr. Mnuchin persuaded the future media mogul Sumner Redstone to become an advertiser and kept a tight lid on costs. “What struck me at the time was a really narrow insistence on the paper’s profit at the expense of what I thought we were there to do, which was inform, entertain, enlighten,” said Anndee Hochman, the editor in chief during Mr. Mnuchin’s tenure. Brett Ratner, Mr. Mnuchin’s longtime Hollywood partner, producing films such as “The Lego Batman Movie,” said he had no inkling that Mr. Mnuchin cared about politics. Then one day in 2016 Mr. Mnuchin announced that he was joining the fledgling Trump campaign as finance chairman. “I nearly fell out of my chair,” Mr. Ratner said. Mr. Mnuchin had no political fund-raising experience. But he had a social and business relationship with the candidate. And after watching an adoring Indianapolis crowd scream for Mr. Trump — the only thing Mr. Mnuchin could compare it to was when Mick Jagger had taken him to a Rolling Stones concert — Mr. Mnuchin was convinced that Mr. Trump would win. On the surface, the flamboyant candidate and the often dour Mr. Mnuchin appeared to have little in common. But the two men shared an interest in deals, especially of the real estate variety. Mr. Mnuchin made his name at Goldman Sachs in the mortgage-backed bonds business. And like Mr. Trump he owned a portfolio of luxury properties: a mansion in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles, a duplex in Manhattan’s prestigious 740 Park Avenue building, a waterfront estate in Southampton, N.Y. — the list went on. Days after being confirmed as Treasury secretary he paid $12.6 million for a nine-bedroom mansion in Washington. Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Trump also both had to vie for the attention of wealthy, self-made fathers. Robert Mnuchin, himself a former top executive at Goldman Sachs, has said that as he pursued his Wall Street career, he spent little time with Steven and his brother. (He has mused to acquaintances about whether his neglect fueled his son’s ambitions.) Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Mnuchin had a gilded youth; his red Porsche featured custom plaid upholstery. After the election, Mr. Trump tried to recruit Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase chief executive, to be Treasury secretary. Mr. Dimon, a Democrat, said no, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Mnuchin showed up for his job interview at Mr. Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, N.J., with three pages of notes detailing his credentials: He made partner at Goldman; he ran a hedge fund, Dune Capital; he earned a fortune buying and selling IndyMac Bank in California; he financed a slate of Hollywood movies. Mr. Mnuchin’s career was a success — his net worth was more than $400 million — but he was hardly a top-tier financial player. He had never been a candidate to lead Goldman; Dune was small by hedge fund standards; IndyMac was tainted by allegations of abusive foreclosures; quite a few of his films were flops. Mr. Mnuchin got the job, but things didn’t get off to a great start. Republicans jeered him when he pleaded to raise the national debt limit. Critics in the administration derided him as a Wall Street apologist. The White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, likened him to Neville Chamberlain — the British prime minister who infamously appeased the Nazis — for his aversion to a trade war with China. But Mr. Mnuchin cemented his bond with Mr. Trump after the president said white supremacists who had marched in Charlottesville, Va., included some “very fine people.” Mr. Mnuchin wrote an open letter to former Yale classmates who had called on him to resign: “I feel compelled to let you know that the president in no way, shape or form believes that neo-Nazi and other hate groups who endorse violence are equivalent to groups that demonstrate in peaceful and lawful ways.” Then, at the end of Mr. Trump’s first year in office, Mr. Mnuchin eased a $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts through the Republican-controlled Congress. It was the president’s signature legislative achievement. One day last year, Howard Saunders encountered Robert Mnuchin at the Matthew Marks art gallery in Manhattan. The two strangers — Mr. Saunders an artist, Mr. Mnuchin a prominent gallery owner and art dealer — struck up a conversation. It turned awkward when Mr. Saunders realized he was speaking to the Treasury secretary’s father. Sounding disgusted, Mr. Saunders asked Mr. Mnuchin about his son. The elder Mr. Mnuchin appeared pained. “His politics appall me, too, really appall me,” he replied, according to Mr. Saunders. “But he’s my son.” Robert Mnuchin didn’t respond to requests for comment for this article. When a New York Times reporter asked him about his son last year, he demurred but seemed to be near tears. Robert Mnuchin’s wife, Adriana, has reminded people that she is not Steven’s biological mother. (The couple married when he was a toddler.) She reluctantly attended Steven’s 2017 wedding to the Scottish-born actress Louise Linton. Ms. Mnuchin pretended her arm was injured in order to avoid having to shake hands with Mr. Trump, according to her grandson Zan Mnuchin Rozen. Even Ms. Linton has said people shouldn’t assume she shares her husband’s politics. Mr. Rozen, 22, wrote on Facebook in June that “my uncle has been complicit in, and in some cases directly culpable for, many years of the marginalization, persecution and stereotyping of black people in the United States.” His actions “cannot and will never be defensible.” Mr. Rozen deleted the post but said he stood by what he had written. “It’s a very complicated relationship,” he said. “There’s definitely some tension.” Mr. Mnuchin said in one of two recent interviews for this article that he tried to avoid discussing politics with his family. Mr. Mnuchin, 57, is tall and lanky. He keeps fit by taking his Secret Service detail on roughly 40-mile bike rides to and from Mount Vernon. He recently took up boxing. Before the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Mnuchin had not accumulated much good will outside the Trump administration. He comes across as stiff and aloof. He rarely smiles or indulges in small talk, at least in public. (To break the ice, he occasionally impersonates Inspector Clouseau from the “Pink Panther” films.) Democrats and independent watchdogs have pilloried Mr. Mnuchin for appearing to help his old banking buddies. He was accused of conflicts of interest for urging to get China to let more Hollywood films, like those he produced, into the country. Last year he flew from Washington to Los Angeles on the private aircraft of Michael R. Milken, the billionaire junk-bond pioneer convicted of conspiracy and fraud. Mr. Mnuchin at the time was pushing for him to receive a presidential pardon. Mr. Mnuchin is a self-proclaimed micromanager. Career members of the tax policy staff rarely met with Treasury secretaries in previous administrations; they are regularly called to brief Mr. Mnuchin. On March 2, as financial markets were in upheaval, Mr. Mnuchin held a one-hour meeting about the “grain glitch,” a technical wrinkle in the 2017 tax law. Until the second week of March, Mr. Mnuchin, like most people in the Trump administration, regarded the coronavirus as a minor threat to the U.S. economy. Mr. Mnuchin opposed aggressive efforts to curb the virus, arguing in White House meetings that it was no worse than the seasonal flu and worrying that halting flights from China would provoke the Chinese government. (Monica Crowley, a Treasury spokeswoman, said Mr. Mnuchin did not oppose restricting flights.) Mr. Trump imposed the flight ban. Mr. Mnuchin accepted Mr. Trump’s decision and moved on, which colleagues say is typical: He offers opinions when asked, even when he knows Mr. Trump will disagree, and then executes whatever the president decides. He appears to have little stake in particular outcomes. Does he agree or disagree with Mr. Trump’s stance on a given issue? In Mr. Mnuchin’s view, that is irrelevant. He is there to follow orders. In early March, investors were panicking at the prospect of a prolonged national emergency. Airline travel collapsed. Unemployment claims leapt. By the end of the month’s first week, stock markets were down nearly 20 percent from their high. The next week got off to an even worse start, with stock markets plunging another 8 percent on Monday, March 9. That afternoon, Mr. Mnuchin joined Mr. Trump and his coronavirus task force at the White House. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, delivered grim news: The virus was spreading in the United States at an exponential rate. “There’s big trouble coming,” Mr. Mnuchin said to Mr. Kudlow as they left the room. “I’m afraid you’re right,” Mr. Kudlow agreed. The next day, Mr. Trump spoke about the virus on Capitol Hill. “Just stay calm,” he urged. “It will go away.” Mr. Mnuchin, however, had shifted into crisis mode. He spoke with Ms. Pelosi that afternoon to talk about an economic rescue plan. Mr. Mnuchin was pretty much the only member of the administration on speaking terms with the House speaker. (They had developed a working relationship while negotiating an increase in the national debt ceiling last year.) They discussed bailouts for the airline and hotel industries, cash payments to workers, and aid for small businesses. Afterward, Mr. Mnuchin called the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and got his blessing to pursue the negotiations on his own. “The secretary of the Treasury is going to have ball control for the administration,” Mr. McConnell told reporters after their talk. “We’re hoping that he and the speaker can pull this together.” Stress was building in the credit markets, the lifeblood of the modern financial system. Trading of commercial paper — a vital day-to-day financing source for major companies — was drying up. Investors were dumping municipal bonds, jeopardizing the ability of states and cities to borrow money and pay employees.
