By Ashley Southall and William K. Rashbaum The question of who killed Jam Master Jay, the D.J. for the pioneering rap group Run-DMC, inside a Queens recording studio has remained a mystery for nearly 18 years. But federal prosecutors on Monday will announce the indictment of two men who have long been suspected of participating in the killing of the D.J., whose real name was Jason Mizell. The men, Ronald Washington and Karl Jordan, Jr., were indicted on charges of murder while engaged in drug trafficking, according to two law enforcement officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Washington, 56, is currently serving a federal prison sentence for robbery. Mr. Jordan, 36, was taken into custody on Sunday. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
