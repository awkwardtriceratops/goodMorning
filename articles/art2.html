But his most personal case remains unsolved. By Reggie Ugwu Making something new is like climbing a mountain without a map. Only at the end of the journey does the route come clearly into view. On the new Netflix series “Song Exploder,” based on the podcast of the same name created by Hrishikesh Hirway, the blind expeditions of popular music artists, including R.E.M., Alicia Keys and Ty Dolla Sign, are recognized as their own form of entertainment. Using a mix of interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, the series spotlights the chaotic trail of stumbles, breakthroughs and revelations that led to the creation of a single song. Hirway, a podcast impresario and the host and an executive producer of the “Song Exploder” television series, is a devoted connoisseur of the creative process. He is an artist himself — he makes music with the bands the One AM Radio and Moors, and composes scores for film and television — but is best known for his growing portfolio of podcasts, all of which circle the basic question of what it takes to make something meaningful. In addition to “Song Exploder,” Hirway created and hosts or co-hosts “The West Wing Weekly” (co-hosted by a friend and actor from the series, Joshua Malina); “Partners”; and, most recently, “Home Cooking,” with the chef and best-selling author Samin Nosrat, also a friend. The Netflix show, which premiered in September and will return next month with a second batch of episodes featuring Dua Lipa, Nine Inch Nails, the Killers and Natalia Lafourcade, has afforded him a bigger canvas and a powerful patron that few other independent podcasters have been able to reach. But the more successful Hirway has become at chronicling other artists’ journeys, the more he finds himself haunted by the gaps in his own. HIRWAY, 41, IS TALL, with a swoop of black hair, a Zen disposition and one of those improbably smooth radio voices that could double as a treatment for hypertension. “I have this daydream that when I’m older I’ll just make music and narrate audiobooks,” he said, during a series of interviews in October. For the time being, he was busy with his actual jobs, which included recording and editing biweekly episodes of the “Song Exploder” and “Home Cooking” podcasts, preparing to record a special edition of “The West Wing Weekly” with its creator, Aaron Sorkin, mixing the soundtrack for a video game score he had written and adding the finishing touches to the latest episodes of the Netflix series. When we first spoke, he was at the spartan-chic home in Los Angeles that he shares with his wife, a fashion designer. He took our video call in his garage recording studio, surrounded by a piano and guitars, where he spends 10 to 11 hours every day. If anything, quarantine had only increased his productivity. “Home Cooking,” another of Hirway’s daydreams, on which he and Nosrat respond to listeners’ cooking conundrums, began in March as a response to the first wave of the Coronavirus pandemic. “He’s an ideas machine — ‘What about this? What about that?’” Nosrat said. “One of his super powers is that he’s very good at knowing what will work and what won’t.” The son of Indian immigrants who settled in Peabody, Mass., Hirway didn’t intend to become a media maven. His father was a food scientist, and his mother worked for Sears. Hirway fell in love with music as a child — first playing piano, then, in high-school bands, drums and guitar — and, to his parents’ distress, studied art at Yale. After graduating in 2000, he worked as a graphic designer while attempting to turn his college band, the One AM Radio, into a full-time gig.
