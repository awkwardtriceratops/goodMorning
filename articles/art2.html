By Danielle Braff Beth Harmon was facing a “sudden death” of sorts. The fictional chess star overcame her childhood as an orphan, she battled her addiction to pills and alcohol, and she managed to make it into the world championship in Russia. The problem now? She had spent all her money on clothing and couldn’t afford her $3,000 trip to the biggest game of all time. “You could give me the black dress,” Beth’s friend suggests on an episode of “The Queen’s Gambit.” “Or the purple one.” Beth laughs and declines both offers. In a field dominated by men, thick glasses and ill-fitting white button-down shirts, Beth Harmon is a sudden style idol. Yes, she’s a character developed from Walter Tevis’s novel of the same name and now outfitted by Gabriele Binder on a hit Netflix series. But somehow, she may be able to broker an introduction from the chess world to the fashion world, an unlikely yet beautiful pairing.
