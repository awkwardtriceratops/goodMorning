It Didn’t.<br></h1><p id="artcont">President Trump told suburban voters that affordable housing would hurt property values and increase crime. The story of one Wisconsin community challenges those assumptions. By John Eligon NEW BERLIN, Wis. — When John Blaguski first heard about a proposal to build an affordable housing complex near his home in the Milwaukee suburb of New Berlin, Wis., his mind drifted to stereotypes of crime-ridden, shoddily constructed projects. “If I wanted to live by low-cost housing people,” he wrote in an email to the mayor at the time, “I would have stayed in Milwaukee County.” But now, eight years after a legal battle forced the city to allow the development to proceed, Mr. Blaguski, 62, said he regretted his visceral opposition. The 102-unit complex is not the nuisance he had envisioned. When he drives by, he hardly notices it. And fears of a crime wave and plummeting property values — voiced by dozens of residents in public meetings — never materialized. “I just shot from the hip on that and probably should have been more wary,” Mr. Blaguski said in a recent interview. “If they wanted to build another, more power to them.” The story of the fight over affordable housing in New Berlin, a deeply conservative suburb about 15 miles southwest of Milwaukee, challenges a key pitch made by President Trump to voters in the suburbs — that “low-income” housing invites crime and hurts property values. The reality in New Berlin is that the mixed-income development, surrounded by a pond, a farmers’ market and a library, is “really rather attractive,” said Mayor Dave Ament, who is white and staunchly opposed the project as an alderman a decade ago. Still, while the complex, City Center at Deer Creek, may have defied expectations, it has not shifted the politics of New Berlin. Mr. Trump, who eliminated a regulation put into place under Barack Obama that could have spurred more affordable housing development in the suburbs and has not aggressively enforced fair housing laws, remains deeply popular. And although Mr. Trump narrowly lost the state in this week’s presidential election, he captured about 59 percent of the vote in Waukesha County, which includes New Berlin, about the same amount he won four years ago. To this day, residents hold lingering resentment over allegations that their opposition to the housing development was driven by racism. Many remain bitter at what they believe was improper meddling by the Obama administration. “I don’t think they had any concern at all about whether or not people with limited incomes could live in New Berlin,” said Art Marquardt, 58, a resident since 1991. “I believe that they had a political ax to grind and that they wanted to push that into New Berlin just to start a fight.” Dozens of residents stepped to the microphone. It was June 7, 2010, and the city’s Plan Commission was holding its first public meeting since approving the affordable housing project a month earlier by a 4-3 vote. It also had been nearly two weeks since Jack Chiovatero, the mayor at the time, wrote a blunt email to a constituent that caused outrage: “Our city is filled with prejudice and bigoted people who with very few facts are making this project into something evil and degrading,” he wrote. Residents were appalled. Many insisted that their opposition had nothing to do with race, but instead with their belief that low-income housing did not fit the upscale vision that city officials had presented for the area where the development would be built. “We built our brand-new home here because we worked hard to become residents of New Berlin — not because we got a handout, not because somebody paved the way for us,” one woman said. One man described seeing an increase in crime when a “lower-income element” moved into his former Milwaukee neighborhood. “You put this low-income housing into this part of the city,” he said, and “I guarantee you this is what you’re inviting into our community.” At least one resident wrote a letter teasing at fears that her city would turn into the North Side of Milwaukee, which is predominantly Black. Mr. Chiovatero, who is white, said someone sprayed an anti-Black slur on his fence. A few residents, he said, privately told him things like “We don’t want those kinds of people here” or “I moved out of the city of Milwaukee — my neighborhood was turning Black, or my neighborhood was turning Hispanic.” There was an assumption, too, that people who lived in low-income housing did not work. City officials and the developer perpetuated that myth by emphasizing that the development was “work force” housing and would attract working people, unlike “low-income” projects. In fact, most working-age, able-bodied people receiving government assistance for housing have jobs or were recently employed, according to a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The development proposed in New Berlin was relying on low-income housing tax credits, which were introduced in 1986 as part of the largest federal program for building new affordable housing. These developments are vastly different from the public housing projects the government built through the middle of the 20th century. By the 1980s, the federal government had almost completely stopped building low-income housing, leaving it mostly to private developers through tax credits, said Edward Goetz, a professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Minnesota. Tax-credit developments, which must set aside a share of their units for people with low earnings, usually employ construction styles that mesh with the surrounding communities. In New Berlin, neighborhoods consist primarily of tract housing with no sidewalks. Residents often leave their garage doors open, and over the years, they have openly feared that too much development could lead to the creation of direct bus routes to Milwaukee. Research has shown that tax-credit properties generally do not increase crime in affluent communities. They also tend to have little effect on property values in wealthy neighborhoods, though a Stanford University study found that some nearby home prices fell in more prosperous communities. One of the residents who spoke at that June 2010 meeting may have best summarized the community’s feelings when he explained that he had seen firsthand the negative impact of low-income housing in Milwaukee. The man, the only Black person to speak that evening, said he had worked hard to get his family to New Berlin, “to get away from that kind of deal.” “So now my wife can go pump gas,” he said. “My son can ride his bike through the community.” But all that would change if the housing development came to New Berlin, the man said, and the room erupted in some of the loudest applause of the night. After that June meeting, the Plan Commission rescinded its approval of the development. The developer, Milo Pinkerton, then tried to put the affordable housing complex in a stalled condominium development, but city officials denied that as well.
