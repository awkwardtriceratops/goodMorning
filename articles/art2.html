To the Editor: Re “President Lashes Out at His Aides With Calls to Indict Political Rivals” (front page, Oct. 9): The president’s decidedly irrational behavior in recent days in the midst of his coronavirus ordeal is a cause for alarm and deserves a strong response, even in the form of an intervention, for the safety and protection of the country. A lack of transparency by the president’s medical team since he became sick with Covid-19 has clouded the picture of his recovery, reducing the nation’s medical community, which is deprived of vital facts, to only speculate on key aspects of his condition. If the president’s medication regimen, notably steroids, is affecting his mental state, there is a heightened cause for concern, because even a pre-Covid Donald Trump increasingly demonstrated erratic behavior. Clearly, Mr. Trump is not OK, and it’s time for members of Congress and high-level executive branch people to step forward and urgently weigh in on rescuing the country from this unhinged president. On Friday Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled her ideas for Congress to constitutionally deal with the president’s very concerning performance. Roger Hirschberg
