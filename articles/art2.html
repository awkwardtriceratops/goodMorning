Here’s the business news to watch in the week ahead. Global markets started the week with a gain on Monday as investors saw positive signs in a new Asian free-trade deal and a report that a second coronavirus vaccine in development was highly effective in preliminary tests. The S&P 500 rose more than half a percent in early trading, after having ended trading on Friday at a record high. The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 1 percent, and was on track for its own record. The gains came after Moderna, a drugmaker based in Cambridge, Mass., said its vaccine was 94.5 percent effective, based on an early look at the results from its large, continuing study. Moderna’s shares jumped more than 8 percent in early trading. Investor optimism about the potential for a vaccine to contain the pandemic also helped drive stocks higher last week after Pfizer and its partner BioNTech reported similarly strong trial results. The rally has come even though it is likely to be several months before either vaccine is available. Pfizer’s shares fell about 2 percent on Monday. European markets jumped after Moderna’s news. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 doubled its gain for the day, up to 1.6 percent higher. Other European indexes rose by a similar amount. Earlier in the day, Asian shares closed higher, with the Shanghai Composite in China gaining 1.1 percent, while the Kospi index in South Korea ended 2 percent higher. Oil futures also climbed. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, gained more than 4 percent. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes soared, as traders decided to take on riskier investments. One of the world largest regional free-trade agreements — covering 15 Asian-Pacific nations, led by China — was formally approved on Sunday, signaling an effort by Beijing to curb American influence in the region. It follows a retreat by the United States from sweeping trade deals that reshape global relationships.
