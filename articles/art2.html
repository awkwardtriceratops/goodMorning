By Aleha Landry and Sarah Streyder Ms. Landry is a military spouse living in Colorado. Ms. Streyder is the founder and director of the Secure Families Initiative, and is also a military spouse. Politically, we don’t agree on much. One of us is a libertarian-leaning conservative, and the other a left-leaning progressive. But we are both active duty Air Force spouses who have found friendship through our common lives. We both work to shepherd our loved ones through long deployments, and are fluent in the sarcastic humor needed to weather military life. And even though we plan to vote for different candidates this fall, we’ll both be casting our ballots the same way: by mail. In 2018, the military sent Sarah’s family halfway across the country from where she was registered to vote. So she did what over half a million military family voters did last presidential election, she voted by mail. Aleha has voted in person only once during a presidential election. She has mailed her ballots since 2004. The ability to cast a ballot from across the world has been an essential tool for the military community to continue participating in democracy. With the limitations on mobility caused by Covid-19, expanding vote-by-mail is essential to enabling participation among civilians this November, just as it has worked for decades for the military. Yet this practice has become politically controversial. Just two weeks ago, President Trump claimed that mail-in voting would make this election “inaccurate & fraudulent” and would be “a great embarrassment to the USA.” This week he used his opposition to vote-by-mail as justification to oppose funding the postal service. But voting by mail shouldn’t be viewed as partisan. During this pandemic, it’s the best way to enable participation in the election while protecting public health. If older or immuno-compromised Americans face higher illness risks from voting in person, some may weigh the cost and not vote. (Incidentally, older Americans were more likely to vote Republican than Democratic in 2018.) A mail-in option will remove barriers to voting — barriers we’ve overcome living far from our home districts, while our spouses serve in the military. Some who oppose vote-by-mail fear that it will lead to widespread voter fraud. But not only is all voter fraud extremely rare, but the five states with almost universal vote-by-mail report very little fraud. That is because Republican and Democratic state leaders have determined safeguards to protect the integrity of their ballots — including comprehensive audits, thorough crosschecks and bar codes. Others say that vote-by-mail improves outcomes for Democrats, but that’s not always true. Mail-in ballots in Florida arguably helped elect President George W. Bush, a Republican, in 2000. Moreover, many red states have expanded vote-by-mail in recent years. And even in blue states, as the Republican consultant Rob Stutzman has argued, vote-by-mail has helped the G.O.P. At very least, if there are any advantages for Democrats or Republicans, studies show these tend to cancel each other out. Our national, state, and local leaders should resist partisan fear-mongering and support expanding vote-by-mail. If people who put their lives on the line to protect our democracy can agree that no substantial threat is posed by this practice, then politicians, too, should find common ground.
