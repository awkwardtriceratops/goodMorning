Ginsburg Helped Make It Happen.<br></h1><p id="artcont">In the early 1970s, a law professor named Ruth Bader Ginsburg took on a case that paved the way for a 15-year-old girl in New Jersey to play on a boys’ high school team. By Andrew Keh At the age of 15, Abbe Seldin didn’t know or care too much about gender discrimination or equal rights or other weighty subjects. She just wanted to play tennis. The problem was, Teaneck High School in New Jersey, where she was a sophomore, didn’t have a girls’ team. This was 1972, before the Title IX federal law had fully reshaped the amateur sports landscape for American girls and young women. And when Seldin asked school administrators if she could play with the boys, they refused. So began Seldin’s brief, but meaningful connection with a young law professor named Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Early that year, Seldin’s mother, Shirley, had reached out to the American Civil Liberties Union. Ginsburg, who had just started there as a volunteer lawyer, and her colleague, Annamay Sheppard, quickly led the family to file a lawsuit in United States District Court in Newark, charging that the rules barring girls from competing alongside boys violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. Stories like Seldin’s can feel like footnotes in the life of Ginsburg, who became the second woman to be named to the Supreme Court and built a towering legacy crusading for gender equality. Yet they are indicative of her operating philosophy, that true progress in any realm was best attained in small, purposeful steps, with every increment carrying real significance. And for Seldin, now 64, her brush with Ginsburg was a formative experience, one that shaped her view of society and of herself, buttressing a lifelong sense of self worth. “It ended up being a great life experience for me,” she said in an interview this week. “A lot of the successes in my life came from the lessons I learned from that.” Ginsburg, who died Friday, was teaching at Rutgers Law School in Newark — one of only a handful of female law professors in the United States at the time — when she began working for the A.C.L.U. in New Jersey. In 1972, she co-founded the A.C.L.U.’s Women’s Rights Project, which would tackle hundreds of gender discrimination cases in the next few years alone. Seldin’s predicament at Teaneck High School, then, was right in Ginsburg’s wheelhouse. “She saw her goal at the time as challenging the larger framework of gender discrimination as it existed throughout the country, and going piece by piece, step by step, fighting for this larger principle of gender equality and specifically equal protection under the 14th Amendment,” Shana Knizhnik, the co-author of “Notorious R.B.G.: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg” and a staff attorney for the Legal Aid Society, said of Ginsburg. She added, “It speaks to this larger philosophy of hers that there was no case too small and no arbitrary distinction in how men and women were treated in any aspect of society that she didn’t feel should be challenged.” Seldin had four long phone conversations with Ginsburg as the case unfolded. As far as she remembers, the two never met in person. And though some details of those interactions have grown hazy over time, there are snippets of conversation, probing questions, gentle reassurances and generally positive feelings from those talks that have remained lodged in Seldin’s memory over the years. “I remember she asked me, ‘How do you feel about going through with this?’ ” Seldin said. “And I said: ‘I want to do this. I really want to do this. I want the competition.’ ” Ginsburg was soft-spoken, personable and kind, Seldin said. She recalled Ginsburg telling her that equality for boys and girls was overdue. Ginsburg, who later in life came to be known for a fierce fitness regimen, asked Seldin about herself and about tennis, about why she enjoyed playing the game. For Seldin and her parents, pursuing the case was not meant to be some grandiose statement for civil rights. It was all about tennis. Seldin inherited a love for the sport from her father, Arthur, who thrived in amateur tournaments around New York and New Jersey, collecting a stash of medals that she has kept. She began playing seriously at age 11 and was a natural. She received instruction from top coaches, going to Harlem to work with Sydney Llewellyn, who coached Althea Gibson, and Port Washington, on Long Island, to work with Harry Hopman, who coached Vitas Gerulaitis and John McEnroe. Teaneck had a girls’ tennis club, but the level was far below that of Seldin, who was a regionally ranked player with aspirations of playing professionally. With Ginsburg leading the way, Seldin sued several Teaneck schools officials and New Jersey state agencies.
