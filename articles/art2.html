Students Attend In-Person Classes, Far From Goal<br></h1><p id="artcont">Mayor Bill de Blasio is facing a major test: Will children return to public schools over the next few weeks? By Eliza Shapiro Just over a quarter of New York City’s public school students have attended any in-person classes since the city’s school system reopened last month, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Monday, a low figure that undermined the mayor’s main justification for returning students to classrooms. Mr. de Blasio has said that he pushed for in-person classes because a vast majority of city parents wanted him to do so. Yet despite his efforts, more than 500,000 of the 1.1 million children in the system, the nation’s largest, elected to start the year last month with online classes only. Now it is clear that even more families than expected have opted out of in-person instruction, with new data showing that only about 283,000 children have shown up. “This is a number that needs to be understood as a work in progress,” Mr. de Blasio said during a news conference. “A lot more kids could be attending in person,” he added, “and we want to make sure that their families know and they know that school is safe.” The city is facing a major test: Convincing families that it is safe, and educationally sound, to send children into classrooms during the coronavirus pandemic. Those who started the year remote-only have until Nov. 15 to opt back in to classroom learning, with those children resuming in-person classes on Nov. 30. If children do not return in significant numbers later this fall, it would severely undercut the mayor’s push to reopen, an ambitious yet fraught effort that faced strong political headwinds from union leaders, rank-and-file educators and some parents. The mayor said he expected many more students to opt back in, in part because random testing in city schools had resulted in a remarkably low positivity rate of .15 percent as of last week. “Parents in NYC voted and spoke with their feet,” Naomi Peña, a public school parent on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, wrote on Twitter. “There’s no interest in being in school buildings.”
