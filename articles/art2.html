(And don’t forget the seeds.) By Margaux Laskey Remote learning, empty football stadiums, no trick or treating: Fall may look and feel very different this year, but at least there are still plenty of pumpkins to be picked and pumpkin treats to eat. For carving and pumpkinseed roasting, standard jack-o’-lantern, or field, pumpkins will do just fine, but for eating, look for small, round “sugar pumpkins” or “pie pumpkins.” To roast, cut them in half, and remove and reserve the seeds. Brush both sides of the pumpkin with olive oil. Place flesh-side down on a sheet pan lined with parchment and roast at 425 degrees until you can easily pierce the skin with a fork, about 30 to 40 minutes. Let cool, scoop out the flesh and purée in a food processor until smooth, adding a little water if necessary to loosen. There you have it: pumpkin purée that will work in all manner of baked goods, from pumpkin pie to pumpkin blondies. Use two cups of the purée to make Samantha Seneviratne’s pumpkin bread, an unfussy classic that lends itself to improvisation. Toss in a handful of chocolate chips, dried cranberries or chopped pecans to jazz it up. Or leave it plain and slather slices with butter. (If you don’t have fresh pumpkin, make it with one 15-ounce can of pumpkin, but not pumpkin-pie filling.) By all means, don’t let the seeds go to waste. Once you remove all of the stringy gunk, roast the seeds with a little olive oil, salt and spices: Add za’atar, or cinnamon and cayenne in Step 3 with the oil and salt. Pumpkin seeds are the ideal autumnal snack, whether you’re on a hay ride or on your couch waiting for election results to roll in.
