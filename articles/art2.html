Finding the words to describe this time feels overwhelming, which is probably why I take photos. I’ve always navigated the world based on my emotions and instincts, putting pictures together from things I don’t understand. We were about to celebrate my daughter’s 6th birthday in March when we got news that schools, parks and many businesses were closing. The cake was baked, friends invited and party activities planned. But that all came to a halt. Instead, we were left to create our own magical time. Dwelling on the negative feels unproductive. We can wallow in our grief and despair, worrying about how we’ll pay our bills or if we can afford to put food on the table. These are very serious and scary things to think about, and as an adult they feel scarier because they leave us feeling vulnerable.
