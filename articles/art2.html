That Could Do Long-Term Harm.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Mnuchin’s move and Shelton’s near-confirmation suggest a future of greater risks each time party control changes. By Neil Irwin Imagine a divorced couple that simply can’t get along. They share custody of the children, but have completely different visions of how to raise them. It is not an ideal situation, but this couple realizes that, despite mutual resentments, raising healthy, happy children is a shared goal. Each parent may get annoyed at the other now and again, but they know they need to maintain some continuity in how the children are raised and not let disputes ruin their lives. That, in recent decades, has been how economic policy has worked in the United States. Republicans and Democrats might have had different agendas and philosophies, but both fundamentally wanted a vibrant United States economy and, when the time came for one party to hand over control to the other, both ensured a smooth transition of economic policy. No transition is perfect, but this was broadly true when the George H.W. Bush administration handed over control to Bill Clinton’s team, when the Clinton administration gave way to George W. Bush, and most notably when the Bush team handed the reins to Barack Obama’s administration in the midst of a deep economic crisis. The Obama-to-Trump transition was similarly smooth. This week, there are clear signs that tradition is breaking down — that the outgoing Trump administration is seeking to deprive President-elect Joe Biden of crucial tools to sustain and revitalize the economy. It suggests a future in which there is less continuity in economic policy and more abrupt risk of crisis or downturn every time party control changes. The most startling example was a decision on Thursday by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin not to extend beyond the end of the year several joint Treasury-Federal Reserve lending programs that started in the early weeks of the Covid pandemic. The decision to end them went against Fed officials’ wishes, and he asked the Fed to return to the Treasury funds already provided for those programs. Mr. Mnuchin said Friday that the move was not driven by politics and reflected the wishes of Congress. But the effect would be to give Mr. Biden’s Treasury secretary less flexibility to expand the programs that worked wonders to prop up financial markets through the spring and summer — just as a new wave of coronavirus infections creates deep economic risks for the winter. The other big piece of Federal Reserve news this week fits the pattern as well. When President Trump nominated Judy Shelton to be a Fed governor, she quickly encountered strong opposition from Democrats and misgivings by a handful of Republican senators. One important reason for the reservations: After a career as a commentator who advocated restricting the amount of money in the economy and the now-fringe idea of tying the value of the dollar to gold, she pivoted when Mr. Trump began pressuring the Fed to cut rates, aligning herself with the president’s easy-money preferences.
