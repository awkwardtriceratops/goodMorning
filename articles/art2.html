To the Editor: Re “Barrett Sworn In to Supreme Court After a 52-48 Vote” (front page, Oct. 27): With the rushed confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the nation now suffers a president, a Senate and a Supreme Court that do not represent the views or wishes of a majority of our people. Justice Barrett has said all the right things — assuring us that she is independent, that she will not legislate nor serve as an automatic vote for the president who appointed her. It will be interesting to see whether her actions comport with those words or whether she rules as one would expect from her arch-conservative writings. Will there be 5-to-4 or 6-to-3 majorities that will ignore precedent, expand the power of the president, destroy the Affordable Care Act, overturn Roe v. Wade, and play havoc with the rights of women, labor, people of color and the L.G.B.T.Q. community? Most pressing is whether Justice Barrett will provide the fifth or sixth vote to suppress voting rights in the election, and if it is contested, to repay the president for selecting her. We may soon learn whether Justice Barrett is the independent jurist who strictly and honorably follows the law, or whether she will bring the court into further disrepute as the American people increasingly see it as simply another partisan branch of government.

Peters Township, Pa. To the Editor: For the sake of reassuring a doubting public of the nonpolitical character of the Supreme Court, not to mention protecting her own reputation and integrity, Justice Amy Coney Barrett must establish with unambiguous clarity her independence from President Trump, who chose her with an agenda that he made no attempt to hide. A brief, modest, dignified swearing-in would have been a first step in putting distance between Justice Barrett and the president. Instead, the swearing-in took place on the White House lawn, where, in an unusual nighttime ceremony, Mr. Trump addressed a large and partisan crowd. It was capped by Justice Barrett and Mr. Trump climbing up the stairs to stand together on the balcony in full photo-op form. Justice Barrett allowed her swearing-in to be turned into a presidential campaign event. Bernard J. Kabak
New York To the Editor: With Amy Coney Barrett now on the court we can look forward to decisions based on what the Constitution and statutes say rather than on what The New York Times think they should say. Greg Byrne
Oracle, Ariz. To the Editor: I am a junior in high school, and my peers and I have growing concerns for what is to come. In our history classes we have learned about historical figures having to fight for their rights. These issues used to sound like they were completely in the past, but now that we’re older and more educated we can understand that the fight is ongoing.
