By Stacy Cowley When the federal government began the Paycheck Protection Program in April, one rule was clear to small-business owners bedeviled by its chaotic and messy start: If most of the loan money was used to pay employees, the debt would be forgiven. But as the program enters its loan forgiveness phase, those owners — and their lenders — are finding out that although the principle may have been simple, its execution is anything but. Many lenders have yet to start accepting applications from borrowers to have the loans forgiven. They are waiting to see whether Congress will pass a proposal to automatically forgive debt of less than $150,000, the bulk of the loans made under the program. Square, the mobile payments company, lent Audrey Kramer $5,600 in May to pay the only employee of Sweet Treat Stop, her mobile food truck bakery in San Francisco. She has been ready since July to apply to have the debt wiped away, but Square hasn’t started taking applications. It sent her an email this month saying it was “waiting to release our forgiveness application until we get more information from Congress.” Ms. Kramer is grateful for her loan — it helped her keep paying her baker even as her sales plunged — but she’s also eager to be done with it. “We’ve been cautious, and we’ve never carried any debt at all on the business,” she said. On Thursday night, the Small Business Administration, which runs the program, released new forgiveness forms and rules for loans under $50,000. Such loans make up nearly 70 percent of the program. The new rules mean that some borrowers can still have their loans forgiven even if they cut head count or wages after taking the loan, but they will have to submit payroll documents and other records. Lenders said the change was a start but did not go far enough. The Consumer Bankers Association, an industry group, renewed its call for all loans under $150,000 to be automatically discharged. “It’s almost a nightmare to go through the forgiveness process as it is now written,” Richard Hunt, the group’s chief executive, said. “You have millions of small businesses in crisis, some going under, and Congress is not there in their time of need.” Lenders said they were also wary of processing applications without knowing how crucial aspects of loan forgiveness would work, like how carefully they are expected to vet borrower-provided documents like payroll records. They are waiting for details on the Trump administration’s stated plan to audit all loans over $2 million. And they are getting nervous about whether the government will pay them back for loans they made to businesses that have since closed or gone bankrupt.
