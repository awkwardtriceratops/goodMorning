By Katharine Q. Seelye Gail Sheehy, a journalist who plumbed the interior lives of public figures for clues to their behavior, examined societal trends as signposts of cultural shifts and, most famously, illuminated life changes in her book “Passages,” died on Monday at a hospital in Southampton, N.Y. She was 83. Her daughter, Maura Sheehy, said the cause was complications of pneumonia. Gail Sheehy a lively participant in New York’s literary scene and a practitioner of creative nonfiction, studied anthropology with Margaret Mead. She applied those skills to explore the cultural upheaval of the 1960s and ’70s and to gain psychological insights into the newsmakers she profiled — among them Hillary Clinton, Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail S. Gorbachev and both Presidents Bush. In articles for Vanity Fair and New York magazines, her specialty was connecting the dots of a biography to show how character was destiny. She was a star writer at New York and later married its co-founder, Clay Felker, who encouraged her to write “big” stories. In one of her earliest articles, she traveled with Robert F. Kennedy’s 1968 presidential campaign. She wrote presciently about subjects that marked turns in the culture, including blended families and drug addiction. [Read about how Ms. Sheehy’s books helped readers define their lives.] Of her 17 books, the most prominent and influential was “Passages” (1976), which examined the predictable crises of adult life and how to use them as opportunities for creative change. It sold 10 million copies, was named by the Library of Congress as one of the 10 most influential books of modern times and remained on The New York Times’s best-seller list for more than three years. As she noted in the book’s foreword, most studies of life’s mileposts were focused on children and older people, but she wanted to look at those in the vast middle. “The rest of us,” she wrote, “are out there in the mainstream of a spinning and distracted society, trying to make some sense of our one and only voyage through its ambiguities.” But she offered hope to those struggling through middle age, concluding that “older is better.” Ms. Sheehy built the concept of “passages” into a franchise, spinning off more books and articles that examined other stages of life: “The Silent Passage” (1992), about menopause; “New Passages: Mapping Your Life Across Time” (1995), which proclaimed middle age obsolete and explored new options after age 50; and “Understanding Men’s Passages” (1998). She capped off the “passages” theme with two later books. After serving as the primary caregiver for several years for Mr. Felker, who died in 2008 at 82, she wrote “Passages of Caregiving: Turning Chaos into Confidence” (2010). And in “Daring: My Passages: A Memoir” (2014), she wrote about her own life, although many reviewers complained that she was not as revealing as they had hoped she would be. “One senses, beneath the surface, something fascinating to be said about her complicated, ambivalent relationship with feminism,” Michelle Goldberg wrote in The New York Times Book Review. “At one point,” Ms. Goldberg said, “she writes of her fear of being linked with radical feminists, ‘angry women whose resentment was turning the sterling silver concept of equal rights into corrosive man-hating sexual warfare.’ Yet in the very next paragraph she says: ‘Slow, incremental changes were not going to get us anywhere. But how could we show the world we were mounting nothing less than a revolution?’” Still, over a half century, Ms. Sheehy never lost her appetite for chasing a good story. “Whenever you hear about a great cultural phenomenon — a revolution, an assassination, a notorious trial, an attack on the country — drop everything,” Ms. Sheehy said in a commencement speech in 2016 at the University of Vermont, her alma mater. “Get on a bus or train or plane and go there, stand at the edge of the abyss, and look down into it,” she advised. “You will see a culture turned inside out and revealed in a raw state.” Gail Merritt Henion was born on Nov. 27, 1936, in Mamaroneck, N.Y., and grew up there, attending its public schools. Her mother, Lillian Rainey Henion, was a homemaker. Her father, Harold Henion, owned an advertising business. Ms. Sheehy graduated from the University of Vermont in 1958 with a bachelor’s degree in English and home economics. Her first job was as a consumer representative for J.C. Penney. She married Albert F. Sheehy in 1960 and moved to Rochester, N.Y., where he attended medical school and she worked as a fashion coordinator at McCurdy’s department store, decorating windows. She then interviewed for a job on the fashion page at The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, though the editor was reluctant to hire her. “He told me he didn’t want someone to work just a year and then want a family,” she told The Democrat and Chronicle in 2015. “I was very fresh. I said, ‘I didn’t expect a pregnancy exam.’” She said that in those days, the mid-1960s, women were categorized as “either Holy Mother or Frigid Career Girl.” Still, Ms. Sheehy learned some valuable lessons. “The paper taught me to write on deadline and to see that to get the good stories — to build a career — I had to get in on it early and have vision,” she said. The couple soon moved back to New York City — they would divorce in the late 1960s — and she landed a job at The New York Herald Tribune, in the women’s section, or what she called “the estrogen department.”
