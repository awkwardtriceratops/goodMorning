By Rainier Harris Starting senior year in the middle of a pandemic has brought on more challenges than ever: Navigating college applications and maintaining my G.P.A. while dealing with Zoom burnout and no physical connection to my friends. I attend Regis, the academically rigorous Catholic high school on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. To those who get in, it is tuition-free, and it is regularly recognized as one of the top high schools in the country. So it is more than a little troubling that I know I will have to deal with casual racism at such an institution. Even as classes have started remotely, the racism that many Black students like me have experienced and continue to experience in school feels more emotionally draining than ever. I felt immense pride entering Regis, but also great pressure. My older brother had been a stellar student there. He went to Yale University for political science, then immediately completed a simultaneous J.D./M.B.A. in three years at Yale Law and Yale School of Management. My sister is a senior at Yale, studying computer science and music. Getting the “best education possible” is the mantra of my Jamaican-immigrant parents. As their youngest child, I feel the pressure to replicate. I feel a certain level of success is expected. And yet even in this high-achieving environment, among peers who are “supposed to know better,” I have felt constantly diminished. Classmates have made numerous comments over the years about how affirmative action puts them at a disadvantage for getting into top schools. While I know my friends may have innocently tried to put me at ease about an extremely difficult college admissions process, I see it very differently. Was affirmative action and legacy an excuse if they did not get into Yale? Did they mean to erase my academic achievement and my individual worth? Even after a summer of protests against the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and numerous other victims of police brutality, schools still need to do work to address institutionalized racism within their communities. I am no stranger to racist behavior. In middle school, I was targeted with it, as well as enduring classmates casually using the N-word. Any hope that this would be avoided at Regis was quickly proved wrong. Within the first two weeks there, a photo of me was shared around school by a white classmate; the caption referred to me as a monkey. Even in the most benign circumstances, Black students constantly feel othered. Whether it’s heads turning toward you during a lesson about slavery in fourth grade or everybody staring at you when the civil rights movement is discussed, you get used to it. The shock wears off.
