By Ezra Marcus Resident advisers have always played a key role in how colleges implement behavioral policies. An R.A. will typically oversee a dormitory floor or building; they are responsible for limiting parties and helping new students settle in. At some schools, R.A.s are trained in how to help prevent sexual assault. Now, colleges have drafted them to another front line. They are responsible for patrolling dorms for students hanging out in groups larger than four, enforcing universal mask mandates and reporting fellow students that are violating social distancing rules. Administrations are attempting a herculean task: changing the behavioral patterns of an entire generation of college students overnight. “We have to understand that we have 18- and 20- to 22-year-olds,” said Patricia A. Whitely, the vice president for student affairs at the University of Miami, which reported 140 positive cases in its first week back. “Nobody ever said that we weren’t going to have Covid cases. It’s a matter of how are we going to manage.” The University of North Carolina and Notre Dame all canceled in-person instruction after hundreds of students tested positive for coronavirus nearly immediately. All told, more than 26,000 cases have been reported at more than 750 schools, with some schools stricken with hundreds of cases within days of reopening. Students have been suspended and kicked out of student housing at some schools for violating social distancing policies and hosting parties. Still, there are limits on what schools are capable of. “University authorities cannot be in all spaces at all times,” Notre Dame authorities wrote in an email to students reprimanding them for not social distancing. So much of the enforcement responsibilities is falling on students themselves, who often sign up to be R.A.s as a way to make friends, help incoming freshmen and earn a discount on tuition. Liz Cantlebary, 21, a Cornell senior, did not anticipate that her job would involve reporting groups of students for social distancing violations, wearing a face shield while patrolling dorms and worrying that she might spread the virus herself. R.A.s will be doing regular “rounds in up to four different communities,” Ms. Cantlebary said, “meaning that they’re entering buildings and communities that they wouldn’t have to enter otherwise. And so one of our primary concerns with that is that we will accidentally become like vectors almost for the coronavirus to spread among multiple halls.”
