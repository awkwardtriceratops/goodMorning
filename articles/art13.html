Given the givens, it wasn’t a half-bad nominating party for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Across four nights and eight hours, the Democrats rolled out dozens of A-list speakers — including three former presidents and three former first ladies — dozens more up-and-comers, numerous video packages, a handful of musical stars, a stream of testimonials from garden-variety voters and an unconventional roll-call that took viewers to every U.S. state and territory. They even managed a closing-night fireworks show. In introducing its new ticket, the party highlighted some critical issues that Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris have vowed to tackle, such as immigration, climate change, racial justice and the economic and public health devastation wrought by the coronavirus pandemic. There was abundant Trump bashing. On Wednesday night in particular, President Barack Obama delivered an evisceration for the ages. Like any political to-do, this had its share of glitches, tedium, cringiness and controversy. There was grumbling about the scant 60 seconds that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was allotted and about whether President Bill Clinton should have spoken at all in the age of #MeToo. More broadly, many Democrats expressed anxiety, if not outright annoyance, over the parade of Republicans invited to talk about why they are backing Mr. Biden. Among the odes to Joe were meaty speeches by Colin Powell, the former secretary of state, and John Kasich, the former congressman and governor of Ohio, as well as a video tribute to Mr. Biden’s friendship with the late Senator John McCain. (This bit of sentiment managed to pluck the heartstrings and remind everyone of Mr. Trump’s classless treatment of the Vietnam War hero.) Many progressives worried that devoting so much airtime to Republicans is evidence that Mr. Biden’s political priorities are twisted, that he is overeager to reach across the aisle even as he takes progressives for granted — or, worse, dismisses them. Some Dems also fear that the 77-year-old nominee, who left the Senate over a decade ago, is out of touch with the hyperpartisan reality of today’s Congress. It’s tough to know how much energy a Biden administration would expend trying to woo the opposition — even assuming the Republicans retain control of the Senate. Mitch McConnell, the current majority leader, is proud of his rep as a ruthless, power-hungry shark impervious to shame and public outrage. As vice president, Mr. Biden was the guy that Mr. Obama would dispatch to deal with Mr. McConnell et al. when Republicans were being extra difficult. So it’s not like Joe doesn’t know what he’s getting into. As political messaging goes, however, focusing on Mr. Biden’s unifying impulses is central to the campaign’s push to brand Joe as a decent and stable leader — the person best equipped to “restore the soul of the nation.” To this end, the convention was awash in talk of Mr. Biden’s empathy and compassion, as well as references to his “heart.” Grief, loss, pain — Joe has walked through that valley and knows what it is to suffer. People spoke of his fight for his beliefs. But at no point did the proceedings convey the scary, wild-eyed lefty extremism that Mr. Trump has been ranting about. Mr. Biden’s acceptance speech was very much in that vein. “The current president has cloaked America in darkness for much too long,” Mr. Biden lamented. “Too much anger. Too much fear. Too much division.” Declaring that “it is time for we the people to come together,” he promised to be a leader for all Americans, not just those who supported him. “That’s the job of a president,” he said, “to represent all of us.” Mr. Biden spoke of hope and possibility and expressed his conviction that America is ready to move on. “May history be able to say that the end of this chapter of American darkness began here tonight, as love and hope and light joined in the battle for the soul of the nation.” All this is a direct repudiation of the president, who has yet to display a capacity for empathy, compassion or basic human decency. Many Democrats understandably long for their own bomb-throwing revolutionary. But Mr. Biden’s solid, soothing approach resonates with the legions of Americans who were exhausted by all the Trumpian turmoil even before the coronavirus upended their lives. Mr. Biden’s steadiness — his regular Joe-ness — won out over flashier, more exciting primary rivals. And as this pandemic drags on, the nation grows ever wearier. More than any ideological or policy particulars, at the core of the Biden candidacy is a promise to end the perpetual chaos of The Trump Show. This is what Team Biden was selling. Next week, as Mr. Trump takes center stage, the contrast between the two visions of leadership will become even clearer. The Republicans’ gathering is still a work in progress, but what little is known does not suggest that the president plans to focus on expanding his appeal. Among the featured acts are Patricia and Mark McCloskey, the St. Louis couple who brandished firearms — her a handgun, him a semiautomatic rifle — at Black Lives Matters protesters who were marching by their home on the way to the mayor’s house. For Mr. Trump, they are another symbol of white victimhood. Mr. Trump has never been interested in being a president for the entire nation. At his convention, as in his campaign, Joe Biden wanted to make sure that Americans know they have an alternative. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
