The Results Are In.<br></h1><p id="artcont">A study of their therapy and clinical trials of other experimental treatments are offering glimmers of hope that paralysis from the disorder can be slowed. By Pam Belluck Seven years ago, Joshua Cohen, then a junior at Brown University majoring in biomedical engineering, was captivated by the question of why people develop brain disorders. “How does a neuron die?” he wondered. After poring over scientific studies, he sketched out his ideas for a way to treat them. “I was sitting in my dorm room and I had kind of written out the research on these crazy-looking diagrams,” he recalled. A study published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that the experimental treatment he and another Brown student, Justin Klee, conceived might hold promise for slowing progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the ruthless disease that robs people of their ability to move, speak, eat and ultimately breathe. More than 50 clinical trials over 25 years have failed to find effective treatments for A.L.S., also called Lou Gehrig’s disease, which often causes death within two to five years. But now, scientific advances and an influx of funding are driving clinical trials for many potential therapies, generating hope and intense discussion among patients, doctors and researchers. The new study reported that a two-drug combination slowed progression of A.L.S. paralysis by about six weeks over about six months, approximately 25 percent more than a placebo. On average, patients on a placebo declined in 18 weeks to a level that patients receiving the treatment didn’t reach until 24 weeks, said the principal investigator, Dr. Sabrina Paganoni, a neuromuscular medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital’s Healey & AMG Center for A.L.S. “It’s such a terrible disease and as you can imagine, for the folks who have it or the family members, it’s just desperation that something’s going to work,” said Dr. Walter Koroshetz, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, who wasn’t involved in the new study. “Any kind of slowing of progression for a patient with A.L.S. might be valuable even though it’s not a big effect.” He and other experts were careful not to overstate the results and noted that the drug wasn’t shown to improve patients’ condition or halt decline. The study evaluated safety and efficacy in a Phase 2 trial with 137 participants, not as large and long as many Phase 3 trials often required for regulatory approval. Experts and the authors themselves said further trials were necessary. Still, doctors and advocates said the relentlessness of the illness and the availability of only two approved A.L.S. medications, neither significantly effective, gives urgency to finding additional treatments. The A.L.S. Association, an advocacy group, said that since the study found the drug to be safe and patients can die waiting for other trials, it should be made available to people with the disease as soon as possible. “That can mean the difference between being able to feed yourself versus being fed or not needing a wheelchair versus needing a wheelchair, and if we can delay that level of disability, that’s a big deal for our community,” said Neil Thakur, chief mission officer of the association, which helped finance the study. The association will urge the Food and Drug Administration to grant approval as soon as the company applies for it, and then require rigorous follow-up studies. The group will also urge the company, Amylyx, a Massachusetts start-up the students founded, to seek the agency’s permission to provide the drug for compassionate use while it is still being evaluated.
