But that doesn’t mean they’re ignoring politics. By Ruth Graham The second weekend in October was “citizenship weekend” at Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas. “Up and down the ballot, there are two very different visions for our nation, and every one of us need to vote biblical principles,” the Rev. Jack Graham, one of President Trump’s evangelical advisers, told the congregation. The 45,000-member church has a committee urging members to be “actively involved in our government,” including by running for office. At one point, Mr. Graham told the congregation, 23 members of the church held some kind of elected office. Mr. Graham invited four to the stage that Sunday, all Republicans. But Mr. Graham does not see it as his job to tell members how to fill out their ballots. “You preach on the issues; you don’t insult people by telling them how to vote,” Mr. Graham said in an interview. “People will figure out how to vote if you guide them from Scripture.” Last Sunday, he preached on the importance of religious liberty. Decades after the rise of the Christian Right as a political influence, conservative evangelicals have a reputation for political activism. That reputation has only intensified in the Trump era. White evangelicals voted for Mr. Trump overwhelmingly in 2016, and have remained his most dependable supporters. The president himself, who is not a frequent churchgoer, has indicated that he assumes conservative evangelical pastors would be eager to speak even more directly — perhaps to endorse him — if freed by tax law to do so. In 2017, he signed an executive order intended to loosen enforcement of the Johnson Amendment, the provision that forbids pastors at tax-exempt churches from endorsing or opposing candidates from the pulpit. “We are giving churches their voices back,” he said at a Rose Garden signing ceremony, framing the change as a gift to religious conservatives. But tuning into conservative evangelical sermons across the country in the weeks leading up to a hotly contested election reveals a complex relationship between the pulpit and politics. Some pastors grappled directly with the question of a Christian’s political obligations. Others edged close to an endorsement. But many barely hinted at political themes, perhaps gesturing broadly to “unity” or “justice.” Compared with other Christian traditions, white conservative Protestant churches are notably unenthusiastic about engaging directly in some kinds of traditional political activities. If tax law changed, 45 percent of self-described liberal congregations would endorse specific candidates, compared with 11 percent of self-described conservative congregations, according to a forthcoming paper analyzing data from the National Congregations Study, an ongoing nationally representative survey of about 1,200 leaders of religious congregations. Black churches, whose members are often theologically conservative and vote Democratic, are the most politically engaged. But surveys about voter registration or lobbying — activities that liberal churches are likelier to engage in — do not capture the full portrait of churches’ political messaging. “There’s a lot more political signaling going on than we pick up with these explicit collective actions,” said Mark Chaves, director of the National Congregations Study and a professor at Duke University. Surveys do not capture, for example, an American flag displayed at the front of the church, prayers offered for police officers but not protesters (or vice versa), or passing references to “life” or “freedom” in a sermon. As a pastor in the Christian Reformed Church, Keith Mannes would have said for most of his career that he did not preach about politics. He calls himself “a pretty conservative guy,” and he occasionally addressed abortion or homosexuality in his sermons, but he saw those topics as biblical, not political. But in 2015 something changed when Mr. Mannes watched Donald J. Trump slowly descend a gleaming escalator at Trump Tower to launch his presidential bid. The gaudiness struck him as grotesque; the biblical term “mammon” came to mind. After Mr. Trump became president, Mr. Mannes increasingly felt called to speak directly about what he saw as an ungodly alliance between white conservative Christians and Mr. Trump. But for several years, he tried to stay quiet. “It’s just in our bones that we don’t make trouble about politics,” Mr. Mannes said. “We don’t talk about that stuff from the pulpit.”
