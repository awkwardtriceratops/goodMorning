She was found safely on Sunday, the authorities said. By Christine Hauser Shortly after Holly Suzanne Courtier set out on a hike in Utah’s Zion National Park nearly two weeks ago, she injured her head on a tree with a blow so disorienting that she could not seek help or stray far. But she survived by staying near water until Sunday, when help found her. Ms. Courtier’s daughter, Kailey Chambers, provided that account to reporters on Monday in an email that described her mother’s ordeal in the vast wilderness, which started with her disappearance on Oct. 6 and ended with her rescue on Sunday. “She was without food the entire time in Zion,” Ms. Chambers said in the statement, emailed by a family friend, Kelley Kaufman White. “She was unable to take more than a step or two without collapsing. This prevented her from being able to seek out help. She told me she was so dehydrated she couldn’t open her mouth.” Ms. Chambers said she visited her mother on Monday while she was getting medical care. “She is getting her strength back and hydrating,” she said. “She is still weak but recovering. She has been getting fluids because she was extremely dehydrated. And we are slowly introducing foods. Her health remains our top priority.” Ms. Courtier went missing on Oct. 6, after getting off a shuttle bus at the Grotto bus stop in the park. Her family said in a statement on Sunday that they were “overjoyed” that she had been found safely. The statement on Monday filled in some of the blanks in the story of what happened to Ms. Courtier, 38, whose disappearance prompted a search by officials from the Washington County Sheriff’s Office, park rangers and emergency service teams. Volunteers also joined the effort, and teams used drones and canine units, the National Park Service said in a series of statements about their efforts to locate her. The authorities had said that a park visitor reported seeing her, but they did not say exactly where, or how far she had gone into the vast park. “We would like to thank the rangers and search teams who relentlessly looked for her day and night and never gave up hope,” the family said on Sunday. “We are also so grateful to the countless volunteers who were generous with their time, resources and support. This wouldn’t have been possible without the network of people who came together.” Ms. Courtier got off the shuttle bus at the Grotto stop between 1 and 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 6, the park service said. She was reported missing two days later, the service said. Park officials and rescue teams did not immediately reply to calls and emails seeking information about the circumstances of finding Ms. Courtier or other details of her survival, such as how she found shelter and food. Nancy Hachmeister, a volunteer who joined a search and rescue team with her 6-year-old German shepherd, Hanna, combed an area near the campgrounds of the park, using a cut-up T-shirt that Ms. Courtier had in her car as a scent item to guide the dog. Four other dog teams from her volunteer organization, Utah Search Dogs, a nonprofit organization in Brigham City, fanned out to help. But their efforts seemed to lead only to dead ends, such as when Ms. Hachmeister and her dog climbed a hillside on Friday to examine a blue object. “It was a rock,” she said. “It was kind of grayish and it did look blue from a distance.” Ms. Courtier’s family could not be reached for further comment. A GoFundMe campaign that was set up after she went missing raised $10,000 for her rescue. It said that Ms. Courtier had no phone with her and had told no one of her plans. It was updated on Sunday after Ms. Courtier was found, saying she needed medical care and had no insurance.
