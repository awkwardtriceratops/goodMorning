The moment is when the subject watched Elvis Presley’s appearance on “The Ed Sullivan Show” on Sept. 9, 1956. For Black audiences and many future musicians, the crucial moment came three years later. On Dec. 10, 1959, CBS, in partnership with Revlon, broadcast a prime-time special called “Tonight With Belafonte,” produced and hosted by Harry Belafonte, the debonair and rawboned Jamaican-American singer. These weren’t easy years for Black families to gather around the television. As Margo Jefferson wrote in her memoir “Negroland,” they turned on the set “waiting to be entertained and hoping not to be denigrated.” Belafonte was given artistic control over his program. He told executives he wanted a largely unknown folk singer named Odetta to perform prominently. One executive asked, “Excuse me, Harry, but what is an Odetta?” Revlon was bemused to learn she did not wear makeup. The hourlong show was commercial-free except for a Revlon spot at the beginning and end. At the start, Belafonte sang two songs. In what is, amazingly, the first in-depth biography of this performer, “Odetta: A Life in Music and Protest,” the music writer Ian Zack picks up the story. “Next a lone spotlight shone on Odetta wearing a dark loose-fitting dress, and she began singing ‘Water Boy,’ or, rather, she unleashed it. Accompanying herself with her large National acoustic guitar, eyes closed, brows knitted in concentration, she brought the full tragedy and anger of chain gang life to bear.” It was a mesmerizing performance. Odetta was drawing on spiritual patrons that included not just Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey and Lead Belly; with her classically trained voice, she put listeners in mind of the contralto Marian Anderson. There was a second mesmerizing aspect to Odetta’s performance: her natural hair. This was years before the “Black is beautiful” movement, and unstraightened hair was a real rarity — so much so that, for a time, the cut was called “an Odetta.” Zack’s biography, a solid work of reportage and writing, is one of two new books that assess Odetta’s life and legacy. “One Grain of Sand,” by Matthew Frye Jacobson, is an essayistic exploration of the songs on Odetta’s 1963 album of the same title. Jacobson’s book is part of the estimable 33 ⅓ series of short books about individual albums. He teaches American Studies and African-American Studies at Yale, and his book expands the context of Odetta’s songs, setting her alongside figures like Zora Neale Hurston, W.E.B. Du Bois and many others. It would not be correct to say that Odetta has been forgotten. In Ava DuVernay’s 2014 movie “Selma,” for example, the singer’s ill-boding cover of Bob Dylan’s “Masters of War” plays during the climactic scene, as marchers are beaten while trying to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge. But she’s closer to being erased from mainstream cultural memory than she should be. Odetta Holmes (1930-2008) was born in Birmingham, Ala. She never knew her biological father. She was given the surname Felious after her stepfather, a steelworker. When he developed black lung disease, the family moved to Los Angeles to find cleaner air. Out there, both parents worked as janitors. Odetta was a large person from birth, and she was acutely aware of that fact. (Early in her career, Zack notes, “writers would wear out thesauri describing her hair and weight.”) She was the kind of girl who tended not to come to school on photo day.
