Says<br></h1><p id="artcont">Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia was discussed as a possible target by members of an anti-government group charged with plotting to kidnap the Michigan governor, the F.B.I. said. By Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio and Neil MacFarquhar Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia was discussed as a possible target by members of an anti-government group charged last week with plotting to kidnap the Michigan governor, the F.B.I. said on Tuesday. During a hearing in Federal District Court in Grand Rapids, Mich., Special Agent Richard J. Trask II of the F.B.I. said that Mr. Northam and other officials were targeted because of their aggressive lockdown orders to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Last week, 13 men accused of involvement in the alleged plot against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan were charged with a variety of state and federal crimes including terrorism, conspiracy and weapons possession. They also talked of planning to storm the Michigan State Capitol and start a civil war, the authorities said. During Tuesday’s hearing, the authorities said the suspects also spoke about “taking” the Virginia governor because of coronavirus lockdown orders that restricted businesses.
