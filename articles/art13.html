By Liam Stack Orthodox Jewish and other religious leaders lashed out at Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Wednesday over new coronavirus restrictions on schools, businesses and houses of worship as protests broke out in Brooklyn overnight, leading to scenes of chaos and an attack on at least one person. The frustration was reflected on the street, where video shared widely on social media showed hundreds of ultra-Orthodox men, most of them without masks, gathering after midnight and setting fires and burning masks along 13th Avenue in the Borough Park neighborhood. The anger was also evident from Orthodox Jewish leaders and lawmakers, a group of whom condemned the governor in a statement released on Tuesday night.
