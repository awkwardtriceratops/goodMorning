He is facing life in prison. By Nicole Hong Her voice trembling, the witness, identified only as Camila, recalled on Tuesday the precise date that she was sexually abused by Keith Raniere, the leader of a self-improvement company called Nxivm that prosecutors have described as a sex cult. It was Sept. 18, 2005, she said in her victim statement. She was 15, and he was 45. He insisted, she said, that they both recognize the date as their anniversary. The relationship lasted 12 years, Camila said, with Mr. Raniere expecting her to be available for sex at all hours. He ordered her to weigh less than 100 pounds and directed her to get an abortion. She said she attempted suicide once. “I want to move on, but he has damaged me in so many ways,” said Camila, who added that she was still having trouble figuring out the line between an abusive and a normal relationship. Camila was the first of 15 victims who gave statements at Mr. Raniere’s sentencing on Tuesday, where he was facing a life sentence for sex trafficking and other crimes. The judge was expected to give his decision later on Tuesday. Mr. Raniere, 60, had promised a path to happiness, seducing successful and wealthy people including those who felt they lacked a higher purpose in life. His company offered self-empowerment workshops that were taken by Hollywood celebrities and business leaders. But underneath the surface, Mr. Raniere was a puppet master controlling a cultlike criminal enterprise, prosecutors revealed at his trial last year. Some women in Nxivm were forced to have sex with Mr. Raniere, and even branded with his initials in a secret ceremony. Camila’s mother, brother and a sister also spoke on Tuesday, telling the judge that Mr. Raniere destroyed their once close-knit family. The father and oldest daughter in the family — who had a child with Mr. Raniere — are still supporters of him. Mr. Raniere had a sexual relationship with all three sisters in the family. Another victim, India Oxenberg, told the court that Mr. Raniere tried to poison her relationship with her mother, the actress Catherine Oxenberg, whose efforts to extricate her daughter from the organization were part of a recent HBO documentary series about Nxivm called “The Vow.” India Oxenberg said Mr. Raniere expected her to wait naked for him, like a piece of meat. She became so thin under his manipulation that she stopped getting her period, she said. “You are a sexual predator, and you raped me,” India Oxenberg said. “When you touched me, I recoiled.” Mr. Raniere’s conviction last year capped a stunning downfall for a man who was once idolized by his followers, but has since been exposed as a fraudster who exploited Nxivm’s adherents for money, sex and power. Former Nxivm members said Mr. Raniere and his inner circle preyed on insecure people who hoped that immersing themselves in expensive self-help classes would unlock the key to fulfillment. Even highly educated people became trapped inside Mr. Raniere’s system, which he sold as the only way to overcome their fears, shaming anyone who tried to quit. At Mr. Raniere’s trial, prosecutors lifted the veil on a sordid side to Nxivm (pronounced NEX-ee-um). A primary focus was a secretive women-only group inside the organization. During a videotaped initiation ceremony, the women laid naked on a table, saying, “Master, please brand me,” as a cauterizing pen seared their skin without anesthesia. Some of those women testified that they thought they were joining a women’s empowerment group, only to discover that they were directed to have sex with Mr. Raniere. The women, referred to as “slaves,” needed permission to eat and were regularly required to hand over collateral like sexually explicit videos, which they constantly feared would be released. Prosecutors called it extortion. On Tuesday, a former “slave” identified only as Nicole told the judge that the collateral was the only thing stopping her from spitting in Mr. Raniere’s face during her time in the group, which she described as the most degrading experience of her life.
