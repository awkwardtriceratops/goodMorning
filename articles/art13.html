TRANSCRIPT [CHANTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] I had quite an amazing experience one Saturday morning while I was washing up some dishes. I heard a voice, quite definitely a voice out of this world, say to me, “Prepare yourself, you are to become the voice of interplanetary parliament.” You became a channel for the transmission of messages from cosmic intelligence. Yes, that’s right. [CHANTING] Never before has the energy invoked by the simple expedient of prayer been stored in a physical container, so that it could be used at any time. And that’s the whole essence of Operation Prayer Power. I see it as an opportunity to just let out all my — my feeling to help save the world. Once the prayer is stored in the battery, we are able to release it and send it to hold off disasters and helping humanitarian crisis situations. We’ve used it in the past to move hurricanes and to aid peace talks that prevent nuclear war and the destruction of our planet. You are liable to upset the balance of your earth through number one, atomic experimentation, number two, your deviation from the spiritual laws. Part of our evolution is to — is to learn how to get out of this mess that we’re in. But other beings can help guide us. Lord Buddha is a cosmic master from Venus. Sri Krishna was a cosmic master from Saturn. Master Jesus was a cosmic master from Venus. I gave my life to earth, so that she might be saved from imminent catastrophe. I ask you now in these days to give all that you can give. [CHANTING] Blessed are they who work for peace. O mighty father of all creation, let your light flow through this world now. Let it shine into the hearts and minds of men. [CHANTING] The Aetherius Society is playing a really huge role behind the scenes. We have been cooperating with the cosmic masters to send out energy through our spiritual energy radiating equipment. We’ve sent thousands of prayer hours to uplift everybody’s consciousness. Still can you take part in the great adventure to lead the earth as a unit toward sanity. The most important thing is to just be of selfless service, because that’s what the sun does and look how great and mighty it is. It gives energy to the whole solar system. So maybe we could be like the sun one day, if we just give and give. [CHANTING] And even if you do not believe in God, then believe in good, please. It’s the same thing. [MUSIC PLAYING] Video by Annalise Pasztor Ms. Pasztor is a filmmaker. In the mid-1950s, an English taxi driver named George King claimed that he had received a directive from outer space. The dispatch spurred him to establish the Aetherius Society, a religious group that believes communicating and working with aliens will better humanity. Though unconventional, the group’s practices aren’t dangerous or hateful; they often mirror those of more established religions, with an extraterrestrial twist. In the short documentary above, members of the Aetherius Society explain their mission of peace and their unique prayer method in times of crisis. We don’t know how many people this group comprises overall, but with 35 centers across five continents, it’s a small international community bonded by the belief that the earth needs extraterrestrial support to survive.
