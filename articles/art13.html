It Wasn’t Enough.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Patty Schachtner, a county medical examiner and Wisconsin state senator, with a photograph of her family.Credit...Erinn Springer for The New York Times Supported by By Julie Bosman The pandemic was a faraway nightmare — a catastrophe on the coasts — when Patty Schachtner, the medical examiner in St. Croix County, Wis., began preparing. In March, she counted up all of her county’s hospitals, ventilators and nursing homes, including the one where her beloved 88-year-old father lived. If the coronavirus reached this mostly rural place on Wisconsin’s western edge, full of dairy farms and snowmobile trails, would residents be ready? She had spent 31 years working in public health — the last nine as the county’s chief medical examiner — but she could not be sure. So she kept going. She delivered masks to funeral homes, hoping they would help protect the staff from the virus and slow its spread. She installed showers in an unused warehouse for sheriff’s deputies and other front-line workers who might need to clean off before heading home to their families. And in the grim chance that the virus did come, and that there were more deaths than the county could handle, she dropped off body bags at nursing homes. Part of the warehouse was turned into a morgue. Even this might not be enough, she knew — not with a team of five death investigators to cover a county of more than 700 square miles. So she did what few other medical examiners were doing and rented a refrigerated truck to store even more bodies. “I pray that I never have to use it,” Ms. Schachtner, who also is a state senator, said in March. “But this Covid can get out of control really quick.” To some people, the preparations might have seemed like a bit much, especially in a county that had seen five virus cases by the end of March. But to Ms. Schachtner, it was her job as medical examiner to worry about worst-case scenarios, to take care of the unpleasant, pragmatic details that other people would rather not think about or see. Ms. Schachtner, a motorcycle enthusiast who canceled a trip to Sturgis, S.D., this summer because of the pandemic, is unfussy, practical and plain-spoken. She is also a hugger, a grandmother and a careful thinker about respect, death and its attendant rituals. Once she gave a TEDx Talk on the subject. And all summer long, the coronavirus barely rose above a trickle in St. Croix County. Then came fall. Now dozens of her neighbors in St. Croix County are contracting the virus each day. The local health department has abandoned efforts to contain the spread with contact tracing, saying it is too busy simply notifying all the people who test positive. The nightmare scenario unfolded not just for the county, but for Ms. Schachtner. In October, her sister-in-law got it — then, in quick succession, her brother-in-law and her sister. And then, two weeks ago, her father. The outbreak in Wisconsin spiraled beyond control weeks ago, with rates of new cases that are consistently among the country’s worst. Tests are often scarce, the governor has begged people to stay home and all but one of Wisconsin’s 72 counties faced “critically high” case activity on Thursday, the state’s highest level of concern. Week after week, the state shatters records for cases, hospitalizations and deaths, said Dr. Ben Weston, the director of medical services for the Milwaukee County Office of Emergency Management. Desperate pleas from officials, even as the United States surpassed 250,000 deaths from the virus, do little to stop the spread. “Wisconsin is in a tough place right now,” Dr. Weston said. “Despite much talk, we are not turning the corner, nor are we flattening the curve. In fact, our curve is steepening with no end in sight.” Ms. Schachtner, whose family has lived, farmed, camped and hunted in St. Croix County for generations, has seen public health from more than one angle. She was a longtime emergency medical technician, a job that sent her out on an ambulance and racing urgently into people’s most difficult moments. When she began as a death investigator in 2003, she was struck by parallels in the work. “When the bad stuff happens, people are going to expect you to have all the answers,” she said. “You have to be prepared for that. Collectively, they’re all saying, ‘What didn’t you do for my person?’ You try to make sure you have done everything.” When the pandemic took hold in the United States in March, Ms. Schachtner already had a wide network of connections in public health — people who were thinking the same thing she was: What can we do to protect the community? But in St. Croix County, a mostly conservative area that President Trump won decisively in 2016 and 2020, Ms. Schachtner endured some criticism about the refrigerated truck, which mostly stood empty. Ms. Schachtner’s role as appointed medical examiner is nonpartisan, but she won her seat in the State Senate as a Democrat in a low-turnout special election in 2018. “Oh, I got it from both sides,” she said of the refrigerated truck. “I mean, some people thought it was overreacting and other people were very grateful.”
