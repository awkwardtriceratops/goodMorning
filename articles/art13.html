She was found safely on Sunday, the authorities said. By Christine Hauser Shortly after Holly Suzanne Courtier set out on a hike in Utah’s Zion National Park nearly two weeks ago, she injured her head on a tree with a blow so disorienting that she could not seek help or stray far. But she survived by staying near water until Sunday, when help found her. Ms. Courtier’s daughter, Kailey Chambers, provided that account to reporters on Monday in an email that described her mother’s ordeal in the vast wilderness, which started with her disappearance on Oct. 6 and ended with her rescue on Sunday.
