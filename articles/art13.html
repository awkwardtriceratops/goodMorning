By Maria Cramer The Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from a New York City developer who had been fined $6.75 million for destroying the works of 21 graffiti artists at a Queens warehouse known as the 5Pointz complex. The decision on Monday shut off any more legal paths for the developer, G & M Realty, which had tried to argue that it was not liable for the destruction of 45 murals in 2013. The Supreme Court did not explain why it chose not to hear the case, but lawyers for the artists said the decision essentially cemented a landmark ruling by the lower courts that stated graffiti — a typically transient form of art — was of sufficient stature to be protected by the law. The decision “furthers the idea that street art is to be cherished and protected, not destroyed,” Eric Baum, a lawyer for the artists, said in a statement. “The significance of this decision is that federal law now protects not only artwork exhibited in MoMA or the Louvre but also public murals, created with permission.” In February, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed a Brooklyn federal judge’s decision to award the $6.75 million to the artists under the Visual Artists Rights Act. That law has been used to protect public art of “recognized stature” created on someone’s else property.
