But on this week’s podcast, he talks about what made working on his latest, “True Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Investigation of Donald Trump,” such a different experience. “Trump makes it different,” he says. “The president is such an anomalous figure in American history. His complete disregard for norms. His constant lying. His inability or unwillingness to play by rules that Democrats and Republicans have played by for certainly all of my conscious life. It makes everything about these last three and a half years just feel different than anything I’ve ever covered, and anything I’ve ever felt as a citizen. We’ve had conservative presidents, we’ve had liberal presidents, but we’ve never had a president like Trump.” Dayna Tortorici visits the podcast to talk about Elena Ferrante’s new novel, “The Lying Life of Adults,” which she reviewed for us.
