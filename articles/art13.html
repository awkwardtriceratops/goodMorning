To the Editor: Re “Key States Up for Grabs as Trump-Biden Battle Extends Late Into Night” (front page, Nov. 4): A blue wave. A landslide victory for Joe Biden. As Election Day came to a close, I quickly came to terms with the reality that neither was going to happen. Perhaps the most devastating reality was that so many Americans really love President Trump. So many of my fellow citizens found his lies, his braggadocio, his handling of the virus, his attack on those who dared to contradict him, his abusiveness totally acceptable, even admirable. Are my values, my morals, my ideals, my respect for my fellow man no longer in vogue? Is my hope for a greener tomorrow out of date? Do Black lives not really matter? Does the Constitution not still uphold freedom and justice? Every presidential election leaves one side questioning its tactics. But this election leaves one side questioning just what America is, what it stands for and what its hopes for tomorrow really are. Doris Fenig
Boca Raton, Fla. To the Editor: In his election night speech, President Trump effectively declared war on American democracy. He baselessly proclaimed victory and falsely asserted that the election was being stolen from him through fraud. He demanded that the counting of votes continue in Arizona, where he trailed, but then said “we want all voting to stop” in the undecided states where he narrowly led at the time, and vowed to go to the Supreme Court to bring that about. In essence, Mr. Trump was demanding that the normal counting of legally and timely cast ballots be selectively halted in states where they could tip the presidential election in favor of Joe Biden. While it is doubtful that he can actually disenfranchise voters as he wishes, his very suggestion and unprincipled rhetoric underscore his lack of respect for the Constitution and for the institutional integrity of our democratic system of government.
