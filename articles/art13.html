Here’s What’s Missing This Year.<br></h1><p id="artcont">NEWS ANALYSIS What is American politics without a bit of schmoozing? By Carl Hulse Mr. Hulse is the chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times. I’ve attended every convention since 1988, when Michael J. Dukakis accepted the Democratic presidential nomination. That year, as I exited Atlanta’s rapidly emptying Omni Coliseum after the balloons had dropped, I stopped to chat with a prominent Southern Democratic senator. He was all smiles, sure that the party’s four days of festivities would lead to Mr. Dukakis beating George H.W. Bush. Like thousands of other Democrats in attendance, he thought it was in the bag. They were wrong, of course, and Mr. Bush triumphed. But that was one of the beauties of conventions — the visceral feel of politics, the coming together of thousands of people devoted to American political life and perhaps witnessing something that might only bear fruit years later. And, of course, there were the over-the-top parties, private concerts, struggles with transportation to distant hotels, battles for credentials and bleary-eyed early breakfasts following essential late-night intelligence gathering. This year, I’m not bumping into anyone to receive immediate if flawed analysis as I watch the scripted and occasionally prerecorded speeches on C-SPAN from my pandemic bunker. Many are saying that the virtual convention is the way of the future, and none other than Joseph R. Biden Jr. suggested Tuesday that the old ways are done. That would be too bad, because the much-ridiculed conventions served many purposes, just not the singular purpose for which they were originally intended. The days of a suspenseful state roll call culminating in the selection of a nominee are long gone. But a lot of business still got done at conventions, and many indelible images of convention spontaneity remained long after the circus had departed Houston or San Diego, Chicago or Tampa. For those who were in the political world and for those who yearned to be, conventions were the must-attend quadrennial gathering of the clan, a holy rite, a raucous politifest, a spotlight for newcomers and a last moment onstage for elder stateswomen and men. They constituted a political proving ground, a chance to see whether up-and-comers would seize the moment or let it slip away. They were a job fair as political professionals searching for a campaign to join roamed stadium concourses in a sort of on-site LinkedIn.
