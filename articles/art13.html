It also reminds me of prison. Titled “Rules of the Digital Classroom,” it was made by an edutainment outfit called Manic Turtle, and it’s as peppy and upbeat as the name of the company implies. Organized in a basic dos-and-don’ts format, it features an adorable little girl, maybe 5 or so, demonstrating correct and incorrect strategies for attending school while staying home. First, we see the girl lying on the carpet on her stomach, in front of her laptop, happily snacking on pretzels and off-brand Cheerios — a scenario that strikes me as perfectly natural, and in fact depicts my preferred writing posture. But here it’s meant to represent a cardinal error, the wrong way to do a thing that must be done correctly. So the image of the relaxed little girl is soon labeled with a big fat “No,” and is quickly replaced with an image of her sitting bolt upright at a tiny desk, eyes like platters, snapping to attention at some onscreen cue. She looks cute, sure, but so does Warren Beatty during the brainwashing scene in “The Parallax View.” The label changes: “Yes.” Next, we see her chugging lustily from a sippy cup (No), followed by a shot of her dutifully typing while politely declining her father’s offer of a snack (Yes). We see her dancing wildly to loud music (No), then typing some more (Yes). Later, we see her fill a chat field with wall-to-wall unicorn emojis (No), followed by a polite request for the assignment to be explained (Yes — and the word “assignment” is spelled correctly, too).
