Navalny, a famous critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was reportedly poisoned and is in critical condition. We produced this video a year ago with his daughter Daria.

Teenagers who have grown up in Russia have known only one leader in their lifetimes: Vladimir Putin. In the video Op-Ed above, Daria Navalnaya, host of an influential YouTube channel and daughter of the opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, interviews a cross-section of young Russians about how they feel about Mr. Putin, politics and their country’s future. Her interviews reveal a generation frustrated with the status quo, pessimistic about the possibility of change, and torn between their dreams for the future and their deep sense of patriotism. Daria Navalnaya (@Dasha_Navalnaya) just graduated high school in Moscow and will begin her undergraduate studies at Stanford in September. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
