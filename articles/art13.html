By Gail Collins Opinion Columnist It’s possible you failed to notice, but the Republican convention has a theme for each night. The list sounds a little like a Lord-of-the-Rings theme park: Land of Promise, Land of Opportunity, Land of Heroes and Land of Greatness. You know Donald Trump’s big day is going to be Land of Greatness, right? Well, obviously. But do you think even the president felt a little wave of irony when he gave Mike Pence responsibility for Land of Heroes? Lots of ways you could celebrate Pence’s renomination. Male fans might consider announcing that they’ll be following his lead and will go to events where alcohol is served only when they’re accompanied by their wives. The presidential campaign themes are “Keep America Great” and “Promises Made, Promises Kept.” A “Little Woman, Big Chaperone” T-shirt for the vice president’s female followers might be next. The vice presidency has had its ups and downs. We started out very well indeed with John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. Then, whoops, Aaron Burr. You may remember him as the guy who shot Alexander Hamilton. The only thing we can say about comparing Aaron Burr and Mike Pence is that our current vice president is very unlikely to ever be featured as a lead character in a Broadway musical. One of my favorite veeps is Richard Johnson, a 19th-century adventurer who was Martin Van Buren’s Number Two. Johnson was apparently picked solely because Van Buren was running against William Henry Harrison, who was famous for defeating the feared chief Tecumseh at the battle of Tippecanoe. When Harrison’s fans yelled “Tippecanoe and Tyler Too!” the Democrats were supposed to retort: “Rumpsey Dumpsey, Rumpsey Dumpsey. Colonel Johnson killed Tecumsey.” Neither of those slogans was really true, but everyone apparently loved yelling them. They were, you must admit, more fun to shout than “Promises Made, Promises Kept.” People have generally paid attention to the vice-presidential nomination only when they’re waiting to see who’ll get it. But now that Kamala Harris is such a sensation, maybe the office will have more glamour.
