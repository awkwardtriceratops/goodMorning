His age, weight and gender put him at high risk. By Gina Kolata and Apoorva Mandavilli President Trump will stay at Walter Reed military hospital for an indefinite number of days, his doctor said on Saturday, undergoing a five-day antiviral drug regimen for Covid-19 that indicated his condition might be more serious than had been publicly disclosed. On Thursday, he received another therapy that is still in early phases of testing. Medical experts who have been following the sketchy, conflicting details released by the White House and Walter Reed about the president’s condition were divided about the experimental treatments Mr. Trump, 74, has received. And although they said it was hard to comment on Mr. Trump’s condition or evaluate his treatment given the limited and contradictory information, some said they were worried.   At a news conference on Saturday outside the medical center, Dr. Sean P. Conley, Mr. Trump’s physician, painted a very positive  picture of the president’s condition, saying he was doing well, fever-free and not in need of supplemental oxygen. But immediately afterward, Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, contradicted that assessment and said that Mr. Trump’s vital signs in the last 48 hours “were very concerning” and that the next two days would be critical. Many doctors stressed the critical period of time — about seven to 10 days after infection — when a patient’s condition can take a turn for the worse. Some people respond to an infection with an overly exuberant immune response that can worsen their illness and even prove fatal. Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, said he would be surprised if Mr. Trump were feeling better as quickly as Dr. Conley had suggested. What often happens, he said, is that a patient will be discharged from the hospital but then, a week later, get much worse and have to be readmitted. “What we call ‘falling off a cliff’ is usually a week to 10 days into the course,” he said.   But medical experts generally welcomed the close monitoring of the president at the military medical complex, noting his risk factors — he’s an older man who is slightly obese — for developing a more serious form of the disease. “Transferring him to Walter Reed was the right thing,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, professor of medicine at Emory University in Atlanta. “Because any of us who have seen patients with Covid, especially patients at his age, can say that one minute they seem fine and the next minute not.”  The doctors at the news conference evaded questions about whether the president had ever needed oxygen; would not say what his temperature or oxygenation levels had been in recent days; and offered up a confusing timeline for diagnosing his illness that conflicted with the 1 a.m. disclosure on Friday by Mr. Trump himself, about 36 hours before the news conference, that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. Dr. Conley later issued a correction that concurred with earlier White House  releases alerting the public to Mr. Trump’s illness and courses of treatment. “It is a very weird situation,” said Dr. Andre Kalil, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Nebraska. “Is he being over-treated or undertreated? We don’t know.” One of the therapies being given to Mr. Trump, a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies made by Regeneron, is in the earliest phase of testing, and there is only a recent news release from the company regarding its effectiveness. In one trial, the cocktail is being given to recently exposed or infected people, especially those who may not be able to rouse a potent immune response on their own. By age and gender, Mr. Trump falls into the subgroup of people whose immune system may not be able to fend off the virus on its own. An updated list of potential treatments for Covid-19.
