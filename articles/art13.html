Here’s How It Might Pick a New One.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Back-room deals and horse trading are likely to determine who will become the next leader of Japan’s governing party and the country’s prime minister. By Ben Dooley TOKYO — Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s announcement on Friday that he would step down will open the field for what may become a fierce battle to become his successor. Mr. Abe, who took office in 2012 and became Japan’s longest-serving leader in the modern era, was originally set to leave office in September 2021. That date would have marked the end of his third three-year term as president of Japan’s governing Liberal Democratic Party. He leaves office with no clear successor and with the country in crisis as it confronts deep economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Those who hope to replace him have already begun jostling for position, with two candidates announcing their intent to stand before the official announcement had even been made. The path to the premiership goes through the Liberal Democratic Party. Except for two brief stints, from 1993 to 1994 and 2009 to 2012, the party has governed Japan for most of its postwar history. Along with an allied party, Komeito, it controls the country’s Parliament. Aspirants to the premiership first need to win the party’s presidency. Under normal circumstances, that would mean winning an open election in which half the voting power belongs to the party’s more than one million members, with the other half reserved for its legislators. But because Mr. Abe is resigning in the middle of his term, the party has another, faster option. In an emergency, its rules allow the vote to be restricted to its members of Parliament and just three representatives from each of Japan’s 47 prefectures, for a total of 535 electors. The party’s secretary general, Toshihiro Nikai, told reporters on Friday that no decision had been made. “We want an outcome that is achieved in a way that all party members can agree on,” he said, adding “if there were plenty of time, naturally, we should think about an open election, but whether we can do that is something I want to decide after hearing everyone’s opinion.”
