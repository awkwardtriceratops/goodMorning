By Adam Nossiter PARIS – A knife-wielding man decapitated a passerby near a school in a suburb north of Paris on Friday afternoon and was later shot dead by the police, officials said. France’s antiterrorism prosecutors immediately took over the investigation, and Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin cut short a trip to Morocco to fly back to Paris. There was little immediate information about either the victim, the attacker or the incident, which took place in the suburb of Eragny. A police union official told the French television station BFM on Friday that witnesses saw the assailant cutting the victim’s throat. The national police were called, officials said, and after discovering the decapitated victim, confronted the assailant nearby, close to a school. Brandishing a large knife, he threatened the officers, and after refusing to surrender, was shot 10 times, they said. A prosecutor from the country’s special antiterrorism unit was immediately sent to investigate, officials said. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
