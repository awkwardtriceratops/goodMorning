They joined a teenagers’ team for an online tournament. By Abby Ellin One afternoon during the height of coronavirus lockdowns, 16-year-old Finn Kolesnik found himself in a cold sweat. He was on the phone with Bob Hamman, 82, one of the greatest bridge players ever. Kolesnik wanted to know if, um, maybe Hamman and his longtime bridge partner, Peter Weichsel, 77, would join his team for this year’s North American Online Bridge Championships Premier Knockout, being held from July 23 to Aug. 2? “Who’s better to play with than the historically best player of all time?” said Kolesnik, a high school junior in Ventura, Calif., who learned bridge from his parents when he was 13. Though Kolesnik casually knew Hamman through his father, who also plays bridge, he thought the request was a long shot. Both Hamman and Weichsel are Grand Life Masters and in the Bridge Hall of Fame. Kolesnik had only been playing three years, but Hamman responded quickly: He was in, and thrilled that teenagers were even interested in the game. “There’s not enough young people playing,” he said. The unlikely group, which included Kolesnik’s bridge partner, 20-year-old Jacob Freeman, recruited Bart Bramley, 72, and Kit Woolsey, 76, to round out the team of six. “It’s the greatest game ever invented,” said Bramley, who has been playing since he was 5 and is also a Hall of Famer. “I saw my father playing in the living room with three other guys. I didn’t know what they were doing, but I knew I wanted to do it.” And so, a group that included among the oldest and youngest bridge players were trying to win a national bridge title. It most likely wouldn’t have happened without the coronavirus. “Players of the level of Hamman partnering up with young folks in a major event like that is not something I ever recall seeing,” said Greg Coles, the director of operations for the American Contract Bridge League, a membership organization. “It’s like playing with Kobe or Michael Jordan.” Like just about everything else, bridge underwent a major shift when the pandemic began. In-person events and tournaments were canceled and this year’s world championship was rescheduled for late 2021. The bridge community followed the rest of the globe and pivoted online. Within the space of a few weeks, bridgebase.com, the virtual platform on which most people play, grew from nearly 10,000 players at one time to 50,000. Funbridge, another online provider, reports more than 2 million players regularly, five times the rate before the pandemic.
