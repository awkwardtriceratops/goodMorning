By Frank Bruni Opinion Columnist Let’s be honest. One of the big questions attending Joe Biden’s big speech at the Democratic National Convention was whether he still had enough gas and enough grip to get to the end of it without losing velocity or swerving this way and that. He did. He absolutely did. Is he in the fleetest, shiniest, nimblest form of his very long career? No. And Donald Trump — no Ferrari himself — is constantly trying to exploit that. But as I watched Biden, 77, on Thursday night, I kept thinking that there’s another way to look at all the miles on his odometer and the unusually long road that he traveled to his party’s presidential nomination, which he first sought, disastrously, more than three decades ago. He’s a paragon of stamina and stubborn optimism for a country that desperately needs one. In a period of great pain, he’s a crucial lesson in perseverance. “I understand it’s hard to have any hope now,” he said, fusing his own story, one of extraordinary loss and extraordinary endurance, with America’s. “On this summer night, let me take a moment to speak to those of you who have lost the most.” He told them: “I know the deep black hole that opens up in your chest — that you feel your whole being is sucked into it. I know how mean and cruel and unfair life can be sometimes.” And, he said, “The best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose.” TRANSCRIPT Since that was the climactic moment. And that’s what I wrote a column about this morning in the newspaper. It was a column in which I posited that Biden actually has turned out to be in many ways, the man for this moment. I’ll talk a little bit more about that. I will also take questions if you want to put those in the Twitter comments. I have a producer who’s helping the who’s moderating she will send some of those questions to my computer. So if you see me looking to my side that’s because I’m keeping an eye on what she’s doing there. And I’m also going to read and talk about some of the comments that come into the times website from our readers who were responding to my column this morning in that column. And forgive me for doing this. But I have some air conditioning on as it’s blowing my hair all over the place. It’s like a 70s rock video at the fans. Not in front of me. I also apologize in advance as those of you who have done these with me before know, my dog Regan sometimes fancies herself a watchdog and if anyone comes near the door or walks in the hall you may hear her the dulcet tones of her Warning bark and I apologize for that in advance. Joe Biden’s speech speech of his life. I think it was a resounding success. I think it was a terrific speech on the face of it. I think it touched on all of the notes that one would want them to touch on. And in it came from the heart. And I saw a lot of people saying this in various ways. I said it in my column I saw other commentators saying versions of it as well, because I think we all had the same reaction. I saw this on Twitter. I’m seeing it. And some of the comments that are coming into my column on the times website. People talked about how vividly his heart came through how clearly, he was speaking from the heart. And I saw someone say somewhat somewhere and it’s a contrast to Trump, because Trump doesn’t have a heart anatomically biologically. I’m guessing Trump does have a heart or he wouldn’t be able to bellow the things he bellows and tweet the things he tweets because he needs a pulse for that. But in a metaphoric sense. I’m sad to agree with those who say that Trump does not have a heart. He certainly has not shown one in 3 and 1/2 plus years in the Oval Office. And one of the things that I think is so difficult about talking about Joe Biden’s speech talking about this convention talk or reviewing them or sort of assessing them in any way. Is that at the end of the day, I don’t think any assessment is necessary in the following sense. This country needs to elect a democratic ticket right now. I don’t say that as a partisan. I say that as a patriot and as an American. This country needs to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris because they are not Donald Trump and Mike Pence. I have met and respected and in vague ways at times supported Republicans in my lifetime. This Republican Party is fundamentally different from the Republican Party of the recent or not. So recent past. This president and this vice president are fundamentally different from their predecessors from previous administrations. To me there is really no choice to make here. It’s obvious. And so talking about which aspects of the convention were successful or unsuccessful which aspects of Biden’s speech worked and didn’t work. I think, in fact, they all worked. It seems to me in some ways a silly exercise because at the end of the day, none of us should be using it to decide whether to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I think all of us should be there already. And we should be prepared to vote. One of the things I found most interesting about the convention and I want to say this before I turn to some of the comments is I have never I mean, this is a measure of where we are as a country. It’s a measure of how many voters warranted cynicism. It’s a measure of the warranted distrust of Donald Trump and his administration. The number of times over the four nights and especially last night that you had politicians you had moderators you had other people say you need a plan to vote you need to vote in such numbers that if the count is that if the count is suspicious. It doesn’t matter. You need to vote in such numbers and deliver such a popular vote victory to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris that the quirks of the electoral college are overcome. I mean, this was an extraordinary ongoing narrative of the convention because it rested on the assumption that this won’t be a free and fair election that is that cheating might be involved and that there almost has to be a strategy to deliver a victory so lopsided. So we refutable that even if ballots are thrown away even if the post office is gutted even if even if even if you will still be left with a margin of votes that gets Donald Trump out of office. All right, I’m going to go to some of the comments that came into my column this morning, which is called in the speech of his life Joe Biden becomes a man for this moment. It’s on the times website right now if you want to take a look and I’d be honored if you did. Here is some of what readers said, Christie from Massachusetts said I was stunned at how well he delivered what many recalling the speech of his lifetime many, including me. He alternated between his famous empathy and his genuine conviction America could weather our current storm. Joe Biden gave me hope last night in ways I could never have imagined the most poignant speaker was the shy New Hampshire boy showing the nation how Biden took time out to help him with his stuttering. Some might call that contrived for me. The boy exemplified Biden’s message in miniature. Never ever give up on yourself or others. That’s what I am. I turn off this air conditioning with his hair blowing thing is driving me crazy. That is what I meant by saying Joe Biden becomes or is the man for this moment. His personal story, which I thought the convention as a whole and last night in particular did a great job of telling did a great job of hammering home his personal story is one of coming upon hardships he could never have anticipated soldiering through incredible pain the deaths of his young wife and daughter in a car accident two brain aneurysms the death of his son beau much later in life. Biden’s example and Biden’s message is that when things look their darkest don’t give up looking for the light because the light could and will come in and look at his story. This is a man the amount of time between when he first won big public office meeting the Senate. And when he finally, after many failed attempts secured the Democratic National nomination that span of time as some 45 years 48 years. I think I don’t have in front of me. We’re talking a longtime we’re talking. There’s no there’s no tidy rival for that in modern political history. I think people in American political history period it is the moral of that. If that were a fable the moral would be hang in there. Don’t ever give up. And what you’re seeking may finally coming your way. The destination that you’ve been traveling toward. You may finally reach it. That’s the Biden parable. And it may not be a glamorous parable there’s not a lot of glamor in this man. I like that about him. It may not be a sexy parable but it is so very much a parable for these times. It’s so much. I think what many Americans going through this coronavirus pandemic going through the attendant economic pain going through the racial strife in this country. I think it’s what. So many Americans need to hear. I think that Joe Biden sets a tone that if he’s elected and God, please elect him could be crucially crucially important and redemptive for this country. I’m going to go to another comment. Well, I’m going to go to a Twitter comment at Kauffman maddie says they say Trump Trump won’t leave if he loses election. Let’s come back to the leave. It is clear from what Trump has said from what his press secretary has said it is pretty clear to me that unless this lopsided victory that I mentioned before happens in less even with whatever you know kind of scheming happens there is a vote count that is super lopsided and maybe even in that situation, it’s clear that Donald Trump is going to tell people he was cheated the election was rigged. How many times do you hear him use the word rigged rigged rigged rigged rigged rigged. That’s his that’s his mantra for America. That’s his contribution to our public debate. You know an end to end to civic spirit rigged rigged rigged rigged rigged. He’s telling us that he is not going to accept these election results as legitimate. If he’s the loser which I believe he will be. But do not get complacent no complacency. What if he doesn’t leave. I honestly believe if it is clear that he has lost. I believe the military would be happy to escort him out if it comes to that. I believe he has lost the confidence of far more people in the federal government and in America than we even see evidence of as negative as much negativity activity as we see toward Trump. There remain a lot of people who, for reasons of decorum for reasons of what might be called professionalism continue to bite their tongues. I mean, god knows the half the Republicans in Congress bite their tongues to the point of hemorrhage. I believe that there will be an available, ready and vigorous escort for Trump out of office. To me the question in that scenario is is the damage that he will continue to do even in those final days even in those final hours to this country. I mean, we go back to go back to 2000 go back to the Florida recount hugely disputed cries of unfairness and illegitimacy. I mean, that was a very, very difficult time it’s a time, by the way, that I think this election is going to make look like a game of patty cake right. But when that was over or when it was winding down. What did Al Gore what did Al Gore to his incredible credit do in a patriotic fashion. He basically told his supporters let’s move on. The nation needs for us to move on. Here’s your new government here’s your new president. Show him the respect that Americans should show their president. At least until he or she abuses at the point of not deserving anymore give this administration give this president a chance. Donald Trump will not say that I would stake my mortgage on it. I would stake my life on it. Donald Trump will not at any moment stand up and say in a genuine and convincing way. OK America. You’ve made a different decision. I was honored to serve you. Now I wish the new administration, the new president. I wish Joe Biden and Kamala Harris luck. And as an American, I give them my support. Donald Trump’s not going to say that or if after much thrashing and wailing and keening he finally says that it will be in about two sentences that sound like they’re being choked out and that won’t have any force or any emotion to them. So the question to me isn’t what if he won’t leave office because if he’s supposed to leave office, he will be escorted out. The question is, how much more damage will someone who cares not a whit about this country who cares only for himself how much more damage will he be content to do. Will he try to do as the curtain falls on him. Oh, god that was apocalyptic. I’m sorry. I don’t know if that’s how you’ll sleep I’ve had this week, how much caffeine I’ve had. Or or Donald chocolates I’m going to blame Donald Trump. Another comment Brian. This is from Twitter. This is Michael c Dickens asks Frank do you think it’s possible. It’s possible Trump resigns after losing the election. So pence can pardon him. Oh, I haven’t thought about that. And I don’t know. I’m not going to answer a question. I have no good answer to. But I. But it’s interesting that you’re bringing up a kind of dynamic here that does hover over this and we sometimes lose track of which is that Trump the minute he ceases to be president has a new kind of legal exposure and that a whole new kind of legal legal exposure. And you have to wonder if that coupled with his morality is part of what’s going to inform the scheming and I think the cheating. I mean, if Donald Trump. Let’s face it not to put too fine a point on it if Donald Trump can steal this election. He will. And I don’t say that lightly. And I’m shocked if I step back and go four years back to find that I am sitting here saying this about a president of the United States that he is utterly content to and will try to steal the election. But that’s where we are. That’s who Donald Trump is. And that’s something you heard either in those words or in words very close to it throughout the democratic convention. I am going to go back to some of the com reader comments from my column this morning. A reader from London writes as an outsider. I watched Joe Biden for evidence of his of the physically and emotionally frail elderly man the declining intellect, the sluggish motivational challenged spirit claims for which Trump claims that Trump is plaster all over the internet. I didn’t see any evidence of that on the contrary. Impressive presidential material beyond doubt. Trump has deployed a strategy here. I mean, one of his several strategies that contains quite a lot of risk and the risk is made evident in what Biden did last night and this reaction here from this reader in London. Trump and his minions and his enablers the minions and enablers that’s probably those are probably synonyms in this case, they have they have so lowered expectations for Joe Biden in this speech last night in the debates to come. They have gone so far overboard and have engaged in such overkill in terms of portraying him as some doddery drooling wreck as someone who’s sort of stuck in his basement because god forbid you show him the light of day in the backyard he’ll just disintegrate because he’s so old and frail. They make him sound like a kind of shell animated animated by robotics like something from that movie Ex Machina or whatever. And the problem with that strategy beyond its cruelty and beyond its falsehood and beyond beyond the fact that Donald Trump himself has plenty o. Biden’s only got a couple of years on him. And I would argue Biden’s got a couple a couple acres or whatever the right measures of mental sharpness on Donald Trump have Donald Trump as the yardstick. The problem is when Joe Biden then comes out and shows that he is someone who can still deliver a speech who can still engaging in a debate remember he only had one debate in the Democratic primary. That was one on one. It was the last one with Bernie Sanders. That was the only time he had to sort of go through the whole debate and kind of fill that much airtime and it was at worst tied with his best prior debate and if anything is best debate. So Donald Trump is on shaky strategic shaky and I think kind of very debatable strategic ground when he pursues this notion that Joe Biden is so diminished. So frail, that he can’t be president because Biden has the opportunity as he did last night to step out and do so much better to be so different from Trump’s caricature of him that Trump ends up looking as incredible as he is. I’m going to go back to these comments now to flip that around a little bit. Ed from Colorado says, I can’t understand why so many here and throughout the media keep bringing up Biden’s age. Well Biden’s age again, if Biden’s age in the abstract is a fair thing to bring up. I think it’s fair thing to bring up a president’s age. I think it was fair to talk about how young Pete Buttigieg’s I think it’s fair to bring up and discuss if ever so briefly that Joe Biden would on the day of his inauguration be 78. Then he would be our oldest president on that oldest, but he would be older on his first day in office than Ronald Reagan was on his last day in office. That’s fair to note. It’s fair to ask the question. Do we think ideally our president should be a little younger than that. Do we believe that in general someone has a bit more energy in his or her 60s than in his early 70s. And I think when it comes to the most powerful job in the world to do this you know transcendent Lee immeasurably important office. I think it’s fair to ask the question, what qualities are ideal for what qualities you know raise concerns. We should talk about at all. But we’re so so and I think it’s fair that people bring up his age to a point where I think it goes off the rails is when people begin and end the conversation with his age. I know many people between the age of 70 and 95 and I can’t say from that sample set that there is an age when people are not performing as well as they did before. I can’t say I mean 165-year-old is utterly different from another one. 85-year-old is utterly different from another. And I also think we need to keep this in mind it is not. It is a cliché that the age have wisdom because there’s truth in that. What you maybe don’t get in someone in his or her late 70s is quite the physical vigor that you might get from someone in his or her late 50s. But what you also might get is a is a breath of perspective, a kind of life experience. And Joe Biden is a really good example of this that could enable better decisions that could be the handmaiden to more empathy. There are positives to it. And so Ed in Colorado. I think it’s fair that his age comes up to a point. I wish the discussion of his age would be a more multi-dimensional and rounded one. I think some were Twitter questions have come in. So let me go back in that direction. Valerie well, this isn’t so much a question as an observation. And I love this observation because it’s so perfectly in line with what I was thinking about as I watched Joe Joe Biden last night. And what I wrote about in my column this morning. Valerie Marion at Valerie Marion one says Churchill went through decades in the wilderness before finding his moment. Joe Biden is certainly certainly waited a long time for his moment. And you know, it’s interesting. We keep talking about that in the build up to his convention speech. We kept talking about that in the context of how long ago he’d entered the Senate first year in the Senate for what was at 36 years before eight years in the vice presidency. We talked about it in terms of the fact that he started his first presidential campaign, his first campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1987. And here it is 2020 and he finally got the prize third attempt. Third time’s the charm. Not three strikes are out. We’ve talked about in that context. But we can just look at the last 6 and 1/2 months. Remember and I think this is important remember that after the Iowa caucuses in which he finished fourth after the New Hampshire primary, which came next and where he finished fifth there were a lot of journalists I may have been among them. I have to go back and look at my copy I have much to atone for. There were many journalists who were basically writing the obituaries for his campaign. It was an open question whether Biden was done. And here we are right. So even in this more compressed time frame in context of the year of just the year 2020 we have seen an example of Joe Biden’s stubborn optimism of his resilience. We’ve seen that parable I mentioned earlier in this Twitter chat that I think is such a fitting parable for America. Oliver At Oliver Weiss says, does it bother you that Democrats often seem to reduce democracy to the procedural act of voting. It doesn’t because AI don’t think they do that that much. I mean, they have been talking about voter suppression. I mean, for four years now that’s an important thing to talk about. I mean, you got to talk about that the whole if you have a country in which you are making it difficult to impossible for people to vote. I mean, you are betraying everything that this country is supposed to stand for. If you do that successfully and you have a large enough percentage of your citizens who feel utterly unheard utterly disenfranchised who do not feel like they have like they have a voice in this project of ours this American project of ours. I mean, that’s the road to national ruin. So I mean voting is everything. I think. I’m guessing I’m guessing it starts Olivier wise not. Oliver I’m guessing Olivier that you are reacting to the number of times during this convention that you heard the phrase make a plan to vote that you heard appeals to text here. So you could be told how to vote. That was that was jarring and it seemed awfully kind of deep in the weeds, but that was a completely understandable reaction to the larger context to what’s going on to the fact that Donald Trump threatened to sue the state of Nevada because it was trying to facilitate mail in voting for its citizens. He’s OK with me. He was OK at that moment in time. Who knows where he’ll be next week with mail and voting in Florida a state that he was presuming he would win right. Doesn’t look so good for him now actually. But not in Nevada a bluer state right in the context of that in the context of Donald Trump floating the idea of delaying the election in the context of his attempt to make this all seem like so messy and untrustworthy that maybe people don’t even bother in the context of all of that. I think Democrats talking again and again and again about the procedural act of voting is entirely appropriate and is, in fact mandatory. Do I wish we could ascend to a to a higher level of poetry than that. Yeah but we’re in the muck in this country right now. And before we can ascend to poetry and grand visions we have to get people involved and we have to make sure the true will of the people is reflect is heard and is reflected in the result of this presidential election. I want to look at the clock because I’ve been boring you all long enough. I want to thank Regan for being so well-behaved and not barking I’m looking down there because I’m a blessed man whose dog is, in fact curled curled around my feet. Thank you Regan. Regan would get my vote for Donald Trump with. She has empathy. I want to say a few last words about the convention and things that I think stood out about it. And then I will I’ll end this. I’ll let you go. Oh but before that, I also want you one other thing. Sorry again, not a lot of sleep too much campaign. I want to mention that these live Twitter chats with writers and columnists from The New York Times opinion section happen every day during the convention weeks, they’re happening at 11:00 AM every day every weekday. And I want to encourage you to tune in to next week’s. On Monday Peter wehner will be. And Peter I just realized although although I’ve met you I’m not sure I’m pronouncing your last name correctly. And if I’m pronouncing it incorrectly. Please, please forgive me. I hate doing that heel be doing this Monday at 11:00 AM on Tuesday at 11:00 AM. Charles blow we’ll be with you Wednesday Michelle Cottle Thursday. You’re stuck with me again Friday. You get an upgrade to get David Brooks all of us 11:00 AM live Twitter chats through next week talking about the republic convention. Final words on the democratic convention. There were a couple of things. It was obviously virtual first virtual convention and you have heard much, much said about that. I think it stood out in a couple of other ways. And one of them is the Democrats kind of use the unusual format the fact that you didn’t have to bring people up on a stage to get them heard and seen the fact that you could kind of take the count you could turn the camera around and point it wherever they turn. That this convention was one that seemed to me in relationship to other conventions less about the glory of the nominee and more about the experiences and expectations of voters of the people that nominee is supposed to answer to. And represent. And I thought that was really smart and that was really crucial because that’s obviously a decision that decision to turn the camera around. So it’s not always looking at Joe Biden. But it’s looking just as often if not more often at the country that he seeks to lead. I think that decision made in the context of Donald Trump’s grandiosity of his toxic narcissism was a very, very smart one. I think many people rightly experienced Trump as someone whose cares and cares about him is up there. Regan I just praised how good You are. Now you’re barking hey sweetie. It’s going to be OK. It’s just like a piece of mail or something. I thought that really stood out. And I thought that was really, really important. Similarly Reagan similarly I thought the way in which Joe Biden was continuously described also a considered decision was a very smart one in the context of Trump. And again, in this context context of Trump is someone who’s always telling us how great he is how lucky we are to have him. Joe Biden was spoken of as someone who’s nice who’s good who’s decent who’s honest. Now, of course, I’m not I’m not I’m not saying that he’s a Saint. And we can go back and look at Joe Biden’s life. And there are certainly there are certainly episodes in it votes in it et cetera he’s far, far, far from a perfect man. But the reason I wanted to point this stuff out is those are all these kind of fundamental just kind of really basic qualities that everyone was saying by implication when they praised Joe Biden and saying explicitly at other times our president lacks we have a president right now who’s not a good person. I mean, even I even think you’d have trouble finding a majority of his supporters to say he’s a good person. They support him despite him not being a good person. And that’s a sad commentary on the country. We have a president who isn’t empathetic who’s not going to take a call from a stranger or call a stranger on a cell phone and ask that person to chat about his or her life because that would be time that he’s not shouting about his life. And so there was this theme of humility running through the convention a theme that granted did not prevent montage is and testimonials about what a great. What a terrific president Joe Biden would be those montages and those testimonials are sort of compulsory. But there was this thread this theme of humility running through the convention and I appreciated it because it was such a contrast almost an antidote to what we’re experiencing in the White House right now. And as a closing thought I hope I hope Americans appreciate it. I hope they’ll respond to it because cliche alert but it’s true. This is the most important presidential election of my lifetime. It’s an election in which the country really needs Joe Biden to be the victory. And I think he did what he could last night with a terrific speech forcefully delivered to help himself get across the finish line first. And I hope you’ll help him do the same. Thank you for joining me, and I will be back here next Thursday. But every day at 11:00 there will be someone from the times opinion section on the other days someone a lot more engaging and thoughtful than I am. Thank you. It was a forceful speech, above all because it was a direct one, not ornamented with oratorical curlicues but animated by his messy experience in this unpredictable world. It had enormous credibility because it had enormous heart — and because it came from someone who, emotionally, has suffered mightily and come out the other side. That central fact about him was the theme of a biographical video that played just before the speech began. “Once again, Joe faced the unimaginable,” the video’s unseen narrator said at one point, suggesting that “unimaginable” was Biden’s normal. It’s our normal these days, too. I’m not an everything-happens-for-a-reason type. But I do think that our political leaders are the distinct products of their moments, and that’s true of Biden, who waited so long for his. They tell us something about ourselves that we’re longing to hear, they point us toward virtues that we’ve lost touch with or they do both. Biden does both. Look at America right now. My God. We’re hurting like we seldom hurt. We’re quarreling like we seldom quarrel. We’re exceptional in our death count, in our divisions. It’s easy to feel hopeless. It’s hard to press forward. Biden’s life is a parable of pressing forward. He did that after his young wife and daughter were killed in a car accident. He did it after two brain aneurysms. He did it after two previous, humiliatingly unsuccessful campaigns for the Democratic nomination. He did it some six months ago, after a fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses and a fifth-place finish in the New Hampshire primary cast his latest and surely last presidential campaign as yet another moribund one. He turned things around but, even so, seemed to be his party’s underwhelming default option, its compromise choice. From the vantage point of the coronavirus pandemic, everything suddenly looks different. He suddenly looks different. He looks like a perfectly tailored message to the country. “America’s history tells us that it has been in our darkest moments that we’ve made our greatest progress,” he said. “That we’ve found the light. And in this dark moment, I believe we are poised to make great progress again. That we can find the light once more.” Biden also provides a second, related message whose importance has risen exponentially since Trump moved into the White House. It’s about humility — about the possibility of getting where you want to go not by beating your own chest but by opening your arms wide to others. I found myself riveted on Wednesday night by another Biden video, one that showed President Barack Obama awarding him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As Obama did this, Biden grew so overwhelmed and uncharacteristically bashful that he stepped away from Obama and turned his back to both the audience and the camera, so that he effectively disappeared from the frame. I can’t in my wildest dreams imagine Trump having that reaction. He’d shove everyone else aside. He’d consider the accolade his due. He’d complain out loud — or later that day in a tweet — that it was too long in coming. In its way, that video defined the convention, which often directed attention away from Biden and toward the country that he aspires to lead. Sure, there were testimonials and montages about his many fine qualities. But there was as much focus on what Americans are enduring and what they deserve. They kept popping up to tell us. Biden gladly and graciously ceded the spotlight, an incredibly smart decision in the context of the current president. He was making clear that he wouldn’t rule as some self-obsessed despot whose personal melodramas sucked the energy out of everyone and everything else. He wouldn’t rule at all. He’d govern. It’s a different, humbler thing. And the compliments lavished on Biden across all four nights weren’t the sort reserved for superheroes. They were the kind applied to the best of so-called ordinary folk. We kept hearing that he was good. Decent. Sensible. Honest. And that was what he conveyed in his speech. He promised a return to normalcy. A return to kindness. He promised to protect us. And he promised, at least implicitly, to be an example to us. When he brought up President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he did it in a telling way. He didn’t just recall that Roosevelt “pledged a New Deal in a time of massive unemployment, uncertainty and fear.” He also reminded us that “Stricken by disease, stricken by a virus, F.D.R. insisted that he would recover and prevail and he believed America could as well. And he did. And so can we.” In other words, personal fortitude is bound together with national fortitude. Our leader’s arc is our own. Biden was saying that toughness and faith go a long way, toward a brighter day. And he was telling us that he could show us that path. I invite you to sign up for my free weekly email newsletter.
