By The Editorial Board The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. Aleksei Navalny — reportedly still in a coma — has finally been allowed to fly to Germany for treatment, so at least the mystery of what caused Russia’s most prominent opposition figure to collapse in terrible agony on a flight over Siberia may be resolved. But if it does turn out to be poison, to which all signs point, it will still not explain who attacked him or why. That may never be known. Just as it remains unknown who was behind the killings of the politician Boris Nemtsov, the journalists Anna Politkovskaya, Vladislav Listyev and Yuri Shchekochikhin, the human-rights activist Natalia Estemirova or the American journalist Paul Klebnikov, to name a few. Poisons of various kinds have been deployed in political hits — a fatal dose of polonium 210 against Alexander Litvinenko and a drug called Novichok against Sergei Skripal, both former Russian intelligence officers attacked in England; dioxin against the former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko; unknown toxins against Vladimir Kara Murza, a Russian journalist who lobbied in the West for sanctions against Kremlin operatives; and Pyotr Verzilov, unofficial spokesman for the band Pussy Riot. In none of these cases have the person or persons who ordered the attack been identified, even when hit men have been arrested and put on trial. But when so many prominent Russian gadflies fall prey to unexplained and often fatal attacks, there isn’t much benefit of the doubt left to give. Almost immediately after Mr. Navalny was taken ill, the almost universal presumption on Russian social media and in Western news reports was that Russia’s best known opposition figure — really its only active opposition figure — was the target of a premeditated attack. A hit on so prominent a figure, with the inevitable eruption of global and domestic fury, would presumably require sanction from the highest echelons of power. Until now, despite Mr. Navalny’s years of tireless and very public activism and innumerable arrests and attacks, the Kremlin has stopped short of putting him away for good, usually limiting his stints in detention to a month or less. The most brutal action against him was a toxic dye thrown into his face by Kremlin loyalists three years ago, for which he was treated in Europe. By contrast, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once Russia’s richest man, was imprisoned for a decade and driven into exile; two members of Pussy Riot spent 21 months in prison. The widespread presumption had been that President Vladimir Putin is prepared to tolerate an opponent for appearances sake, a kind of permanent and predictable opposition to a permanent ruler. So far, Mr. Putin’s spokesman has expressed only detached concern about Mr. Navalny, wishing him a “speedy recovery” and insisting that it was up to the doctors in Omsk to determine whether he could be flown for treatment abroad. That is pathetically transparent: Russian social media has been full of plainclothes officers swarming through Hospital No. 1 in Omsk, and the Germans who flew in on an evacuation flight were kept away from the public. Mr. Putin’s supporters have been suggesting that Mr. Navalny was dead drunk, or floating the oft-used canard that he was attacked by someone interested in creating a crisis for Mr. Putin. But Mr. Navalny’s exposés of corruption among the “crooks and robbers” at the top, including a blistering YouTube documentary on the lavish properties, yachts and Tuscan vineyards owned by former prime minister and former president Dmitri Medvedev, earned him powerful enemies. Of late, he had been actively cheering on the ongoing protests in the city of Khabarovsk, and the anti-government demonstrations in Belarus — rebellions that surely triggered Mr. Putin’s fear of a Ukraine-like popular uprising in Russia.
