To the Editor: Clerking for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2009 and 2010 was a thrilling experience and the honor of a lifetime. It was also challenging. We worked long hours, faced difficult decisions, and struggled to channel the justice’s commanding voice and meet her exacting standards. But it was also challenging for other reasons. The justice’s husband, Marty, was diagnosed with cancer around the time we started our clerkship. His health declined throughout the term. In the fall, as was their custom, the justice and Marty invited the clerks and our partners over to their apartment at the Watergate. Marty seemed to be doing OK. He was his famously charming self. He cooked one of his famously amazing meals. Over dinner, they told us about a case they had litigated together early in their careers, representing an unmarried man who had been denied a tax deduction afforded to women in similar situations. Marty was working on a speech about the case for a presentation at the Tenth Circuit. As they recounted the story, they sounded like high school sweethearts, doting on each other, taking the narrative one from the other. The story of that case was made into a fantastic 2018 film, “On the Basis of Sex.” He never got to give the speech. He died on June 27, 2010. The justice later delivered it in his stead. When Marty was no longer well enough to cook, we clerks delivered them pizza. We helped her figure out how to turn on the oven to heat it up. The day after Marty died, the justice came to the court. And every day after that. She meticulously wrote and edited her decisions. She was dedicated to making sure that even those on the losing side — especially those on the losing side — understood the reasoning behind the decision. She never accepted things the way they were, and she never stopped fighting to make the world fairer for all of us. Even when things were at their very hardest in her own life, and even when she was in the minority. She didn’t just put one foot in front of the other. She cleared the brush so we could follow.
