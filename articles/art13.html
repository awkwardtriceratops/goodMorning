By Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman WASHINGTON — President Trump confronted a political crisis on Friday that could undercut badly needed support in the military community for his re-election campaign as he sought to dispute a report that he privately referred to American soldiers killed in combat as “losers” and “suckers.” Mr. Trump, who has long portrayed himself as a champion of the armed forces and has boasted of rebuilding a military depleted after years of overseas wars, came under intense fire from Democrats and other opponents who said a report in The Atlantic demonstrated his actual contempt for those who serve their country in uniform. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, blasted out a series of statements and organized a conference call for reporters with Khizr Khan, a Gold Star father who has feuded with Mr. Trump for years, and Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, who was severely wounded while serving in Iraq and who slammed the president during the Democratic National Convention last month as the “coward in chief.” At a later news conference, Mr. Biden said that his son Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in 2015, “wasn’t a sucker” for serving in Iraq.
