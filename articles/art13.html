By Greg Bensinger Mr. Bensinger is a member of the editorial board. In 2018, California lawmakers passed a data privacy bill that gave consumers back some control over the reams of personal information they share with tech firms. The legislation became a model for the rest of the country. But less than a year after the law, known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, took effect, it is showing some cracks. Charged with enforcing the law, the state attorney general’s office said it can handle just a few cases per year and that tech companies have exploited loopholes. Californians now have the chance to vote on an initiative, Prop 24, that is meant to update the law by giving consumers more control over how companies use their data and by establishing a new enforcement agency. Home to the headquarters of Facebook, Google and Apple, California has the opportunity and a responsibility to continue leading the way on consumers’ online privacy. Unfortunately, Prop 24’s well-intended advancements are clouded by business-friendly concessions that make the initiative hard to fully support. Voters should reject Prop 24 and hold out for a less muddled solution that both closes the law’s loopholes and sets a proper baseline standard for other states. The proposal has split groups that otherwise would be able to offer voters guidance. Pushing for a yes vote are Common Sense Media and the N.A.A.C.P.’s California unit, while those who oppose it include the American Civil Liberties Union and Public Citizen. The Electronic Frontier Foundation took a neutral position.
