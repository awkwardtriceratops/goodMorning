The announcements started last week with the awarding of the prize in Physiology or Medicine. They wrapped up on Monday, when the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was announced. The Nobel Prizes most years are presented to recipients in Stockholm and Oslo in December. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the committees are changing their approaches. Some of the events in Stockholm will be canceled in favor of a digital ceremony for the Nobelists, and medals and diplomas are to be distributed to the recipientsâ€™ embassies and handed over in their home countries. Recipients may be invited to the award ceremony for 2021, if possible.
