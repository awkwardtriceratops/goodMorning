By Jennifer Finney Boylan Contributing Opinion Writer I came down the stairs, hungover and shattered. I sang a song by The Doors. “This is the end, beautiful friend, the end.” My mother, standing in the kitchen, threw her arms around me, elated and joyful. “This is the beginning,” she sang back to me, although she didn’t know anything about Jim Morrison. That song, “The End,” was already 13 years old by Nov. 5, 1980, but it was everywhere that year, after it was used in the 1979 film “Apocalypse Now.” For me, it was the anthem of the times. My election night party the evening prior had ended before it began. Ronald Reagan had been declared the winner before most of my guests — a cohort consisting largely of my boyfriends from high school — had even arrived. The television anchors started discussing the size of Mr. Reagan’s mandate while California was still voting. It was a wipeout: Jimmy Carter won only six states and the District of Columbia. It was the beginning of the Reagan era, which is what made my Republican mother so happy. But for me — 22 years old and just out of college — it was the end, not just of the Carter presidency, but of childhood too, and the world I thought I’d known. The upheavals of our current era did not begin with Donald Trump, nor will they end now that he has been defeated. Nov. 4, 1980, was 40 years ago, a long time ago now. But in so many ways the cataclysms of 1980 created the world we live in today. I should have known the world was changing when Mount St. Helens exploded on May 18 of that year. My sister, who lived in Portland, Ore., then, swept some volcanic ash out of her driveway and mailed it to me. I still have those ashes, somewhere. But that wasn’t the only volcanic event of 1980. Mr. Reagan’s insurgency was accompanied by a flip of 12 seats in the Senate, giving the Republicans control of that chamber for the first time since 1952.
