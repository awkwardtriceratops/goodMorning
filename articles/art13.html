By Dennis Overbye One of the great icons of human curiosity, the Arecibo radio telescope, is going to be torn down, the National Science Foundation, its owner, announced Thursday. From its perch in the mountains of Puerto Rico, the observatory has served for decades as the vanguard of the search for alien civilizations and guarded the planet against killer asteroids. The telescope, with an antenna 1,000 feet across nestled in a sinkhole valley and a 900-ton constellation of girders and electronics hanging in the air above it, was long the largest single antenna in the world, a destination for astronomers as well as a location for Hollywood movies like “Contact.” Like the rest of the island commonwealth, it has been lashed and damaged by hurricanes in recent years, and under financial duress, raising questions about the observatory’s future. In the last three months, two of the cables that suspend that receiver platform over the dish have unexpectedly failed, leaving the entire structure vulnerable to an “uncontrolled catastrophic collapse” in the words of Ralph Gaume, director of the astronomy division of the National Science Foundation. He spoke in a telephone news conference Thursday morning. As a result, the 900-ton platform of radio receivers and perhaps the towers from which the cables are hung would crash into the dish and possibly other buildings. Trouble began on Aug. 10 when an auxiliary cable slipped out of its socket and gashed the antenna dish below. The observatory had already ordered a replacement and was still trying to figure out what had happened when, on Nov. 6, one of the main cables that support the receiver platform snapped. Both of the cables that failed were attached to the same support tower and Dr. Gaume said that engineers at the site believed that one more cable breakage from that tower would cause the whole thing to collapse. The result, he said, was that the telescope could not be safely repaired. In any event, Dr. Gaume said in the news conference, the engineers had concluded that the structure would collapse of its own accord in the future. “Now all the cables are suspect,” said Ashley Zauderer, the Arecibo program director at the National Science Foundation. Built in 1963, the Arecibo observatory served as the flagship for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI, the optimistic quest for radio signals from alien civilizations. Astronomers also used the observatory to map dangerous asteroids as they buzzed past Earth, and to measure the rotation rate of Mercury.
