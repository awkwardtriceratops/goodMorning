Gavin Newsom demanded an investigation into rolling blackouts over the weekend. Also: The Democratic National Convention kicked off. By Jill Cowan Good morning. Over the weekend, the heat, the rolling blackouts and the fires (not to mention the fire tornadoes) converged on top of the pandemic, giving Californians an unpleasant taste of what feels more and more like an inevitable future plagued by layered, climate-change-driven disasters. On Monday, during his virtual briefing, Gov. Gavin Newsom sought to at once soothe those anxieties and hammer state regulators over what he described as a major failure to anticipate the weekend’s surge in energy usage, as Californians blasted their air-conditioners or ran fans to try to keep cool. “You can’t control the weather, but you can prepare,” Mr. Newsom said. “We failed to predict and plan these shortages, and that’s simply unacceptable.” [Read the full story on the blackouts.] Mr. Newsom on Monday demanded an investigation into the outages and released a letter to top state energy regulators in which he said he wasn’t even made aware of the need to shut off power in some areas “until moments before the blackouts started.” He had also declared a state of emergency. The governor warned that the outages were likely to continue in coming days and urged Californians to reduce their energy usage. Still, on Monday afternoon, the agency that manages the state’s energy grid said as many as 3.3 million homes in California could lose power. The rolling blackouts this weekend were different from the pre-emptive power shut-offs that wrought chaos across huge swaths of the state last year: Those were meant to prevent utilities’ equipment from sparking catastrophic wildfires, while the blackouts over the weekend — the first of their kind in about two decades — stemmed from surging power usage that outstripped supply. [Here’s how California is bracing for wildfires in the pandemic.] Mr. Newsom emphasized that the West Coast had endured its hottest two weeks in roughly 70 years, and that blackouts would continue to be possible as long as the state is working to build more reliable and sustainable energy systems. “None of us in California are naïve about the hots getting hotter, the wets getting wetter and the dries getting drier,” he said. In recent days, thousands of dry lighting strikes ignited fires across the state. And while the majority of those have been small and manageable, Mr. Newsom said, firefighters are contending with about 15 active blazes — several of which have been dangerous enough to prompt evacuations. Mr. Newsom said he’d gotten a federal grant to help respond to the River Fire in Monterey County. Mr. Newsom said wildfires were posing particular challenges in the pandemic — including in less direct ways. A reporter asked, for instance, about how the state would address the loss of remote learning time, if students lose power. “In extenuating circumstances, we have to be flexible,” he said. [Here’s how to prepare for a power outage — to the extent possible.] The blackouts came not long after California leaders scrambled to address problems with the state’s virus data reporting system, which clouded case counts, threw into question the list of counties where virus transmission is particularly troubling and underscored the ways in which states’ technological infrastructure has been outmatched by a fast-changing pandemic. Mr. Newsom said on Monday that the backlog of 14,861 positive cases stemming from the data glitch had been cleared, and that the state’s seven-day average reflected that. Taking all that into account, he said, it appeared the state’s positivity rate and other measures, such as hospitalizations, were moving in the right direction. [See our interactive map of coronavirus cases in California.] However, he announced that the state’s county watch list — which had been frozen until the data reporting issues were cleared up — had grown to 42 counties, and some of the new additions were rural, Northern California counties that had previously managed to dodge much of the virus’s toll, including Mendocino. Santa Cruz County, he said, had been taken off the list, while San Diego was expected to be removed on Tuesday. (This article is part of the California Today newsletter.

Technically, it was in Milwaukee, but most of the speeches were relatively short — and live-streamed from all over the place. (You can find the latest updates from my colleagues here.) And this year, the first Democrat from the Golden State is running on a major-party presidential ticket, which means there will be a lot of Kamala Harris. But the California presence will be larger than the senator: The Redding-raised soccer star Megan Rapinoe hosted a discussion on Monday evening, while the actress Eva Longoria served as M.C. (Kerry Washington, Tracee Ellis Ross and Julia Louis-Dreyfus are up next.) Mr. Newsom is set to speak, as is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Mayor Robert Garcia of Long Beach is scheduled to speak this evening, as part of a lineup of 17 “next generation” party leaders who will deliver the keynote addresses. And those are just the Democrats: Meg Whitman, who ran for governor of California, is among the Republicans who have vowed not to support the president and briefly spoke on Monday.

In a testimonial video, he recalled a phone call related to the California wildfires, during which Mr. Trump told Federal Emergency Management Agency officials to “stop giving money to people whose houses had burned down.” [The New York Times] Kamala Harris has fondly recalled strolling on the beach, talking politics with her grandfather in India. His values, ahead of their time, shaped hers. [The New York Times] This may seem a little counterintuitive, given everything you’ve just read. But Char Adams wrote for The Times’s Smarter Living section about an idea that feels quietly revolutionary: It’s actually OK to feel OK, in light of these turbulent times, in this current moment, with all that’s going on — you get where I’m going. As someone who spends day after day reporting news that ranges from not great to profoundly upsetting — but with the privilege of doing so from an apartment where I’m comfortably housed and well fed — the story struck a particular chord for me. So if you, too, have noticed that your joy lately is tinged with guilt, here’s some helpful advice from Ryan Howes, a clinical psychologist in Pasadena: “Ask, ‘How can I multiply this joy? How can I use this to help other people?’” California Today goes live at 6:30 a.m. Pacific time weekdays. Tell us what you want to see: CAtoday@nytimes.com. Were you forwarded this email?
