It was Nadal’s 13th title at the French Open. By Christopher Clarey Neither Novak Djokovic nor Roger Federer could resist Rafael Nadal on Sunday. Nadal made astonishingly quick work of them both in the French Open final, overwhelming Djokovic, the world’s No. 1 player, 6-0, 6-2, 7-5, to equal Federer’s record of 20 Grand Slam singles titles. It was quite possibly Nadal’s finest performance at Roland Garros, which sounds like a reach considering that he had already won 12 Grand Slam singles title on the same rectangle of red clay. But there was nothing unlucky about No. 13. He was on target from the opening game, breaking Djokovic’s serve under the closed roof at the Philippe Chatrier Court. Nadal, 34 years old but still an irresistible force, ripped groundstrokes with depth and purpose, hunted down drop shots, read Djokovic’s mind and serve and kept his unforced errors to a strict minimum. He made just two in the opening set — one of those on the opening point — and 14 in the match, giving his more erratic and increasingly edgy rival little time or space to find his mojo. Djokovic, the 2016 French Open champion, is one of only two men to beat Nadal at Roland Garros. He had defeated Nadal in their last three Grand Slam matches against each other. The most recent of those came at the 2019 Australian Open final, where Djokovic overwhelmed Nadal, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3, in what Djokovic still maintains was the finest performance of his career. But that rout took place on a hardcourt, Djokovic’s best surface, at the major tournament he has won most often. Sunday’s payback came in Nadal’s kingdom. “Sorry for today,” Nadal said to Djokovic on court. Later, he elaborated. “As you know, I am not a big fan of revenge,” Nadal said. “I just accept when the things are not going the way that I like. In Australia, he played amazing.” He added: “Today was a little bit the opposite.” Djokovic had not lost a completed match in all of 2020, his only defeat coming in the fourth round of the United States Open when he was disqualified for striking a ball and inadvertently hitting a line umpire in the throat. Nadal skipped the U.S. Open to focus on Roland Garros, which seemed like a masterstroke on Sunday as he looked fresh, focused and so quick off the mark. Djokovic, a 17-time major singles champion with a 17-10 record in major finals, had never lost a set, 6-0, in a Grand Slam final. “I thought I was in a great form,” Djokovic said. “Certainly I could have played better, especially in the first two sets. But, you know, just he did surprise me with the way he was playing, the quality of tennis he was producing.” Djokovic, the bristle-haired and elastic Serb, finished with 52 unforced errors and 38 winners and had his serve broken seven times (he won under 50 percent of his service points). Still, he stuck with many of the patterns that had worked well throughout this tournament and in Rome, where he won the Italian Open last month on clay. But his many drop shots rarely fooled Nadal, who had practiced chasing drop shots extensively ahead of the final. “I wanted to kind of disrupt his rhythm, obviously,” Djokovic said. “But he was ready. He was there, he was prepared. He was playing all the right shots today.”
