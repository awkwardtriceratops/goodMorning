By René Otero Mr. Otero is an activist. It was the summer of 2018, and I was 17. My mom’s Volkswagen Passat shook to the riffs of Kierra Sheard as she looked for a place to park, and I shook along with it, nervously. I was about to embark on an intense weeklong social experiment. My mom spoke. “It looks really conservative René. Where are the Black people?” I looked around, and could count the people of color on my hands. “René, do you want to go home?” Boys State — the subject of a recent documentary, in which I was featured — is an annual program run in almost every state by the American Legion. It was founded in 1935 with the aims of fighting socialism and teaching civics. (Girls State, its all-girls counterpart, was started in 1937.) In Texas, about 1,000 mostly white and conservative-leaning high school seniors gather at the University of Texas at Austin campus for an elaborate mock exercise: building their own local, county and state governments. The focus is more on the electoral process than the job in office. It’s a competitive, rowdy and intellectually rigorous crucible created to churn out more civic-minded young men. And in some ways, for me, it worked: I did emerge from Boys State more inclined to be civically engaged. But what it also taught me was that I want to stay away from politics. What I learned is that the electoral process makes people complacent. It is not intended to accommodate those of us who are Black, or brown, or queer. To effectively represent my identities and communities is to be labeled “radical” and unelectable. It’s not that I didn’t get how to play the game; in fact, I was good at it. I quickly learned the value of trying to reach people who have no interest in what you have to say. Armed with three years of speech and debate experience, I won over hundreds of unfamiliar, mostly white peers to be elected a state party chair. I praised the values of bipartisanship, though it troubled me to make concessions to viewpoints I didn’t necessarily agree with — including anti-abortion, pro-gun rights and anti-immigration policies. That is how I survived the program. Yet even as I touted compromise, I had to deal with an old devil: racism. A counter movement formed to impeach and recall me. Nothing was off limits. Images of Black caricatures were shared on Instagram with captions comparing me to them. I once overheard some fellow Boys Staters make racist jokes about me while I was in a bathroom stall. I received anonymous phone calls with threats of lynching. This brand of demagogy is a familiar strategy that my fellow Boys Staters learned from the current political climate. They brought in race and paired it with ideals around nationalism, using fear as a mobilizing tactic.
