NBC stars and producers also objected as Savannah Guthrie prepared to moderate. By John Koblin and Michael M. Grynbaum After a day of social-media blowback, the criticism is now coming from inside the network. Stars and producers of hit NBC series — along with Rachel Maddow, the highest-rated anchor on MSNBC — have joined those assailing NBC News over its decision to air a town hall event with President Trump at 8 p.m. on Thursday, the same time ABC will offer a forum with his opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr. Ms. Maddow, one of the few NBC News anchors with the clout to publicly chastise the network’s executives, raised the issue on her Wednesday show, asking Mr. Biden’s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, if she “was as mad as everybody else is that NBC is doing a town hall with President Trump tomorrow.” (Ms. Harris demurred.) The anchor also called NBC’s scheduling decision “as odd as you think it is” alongside a graphic that said, “Apparently They Are Not Kidding.” On Thursday, more than 100 actors and producers — including Sterling K. Brown and Mandy Moore, both of the NBC hit “This Is Us,” and Mariska Hargitay of the NBC staple “Law & Order: SVU” — sent a letter to NBC management calling the scheduling of the forum “a disservice to the American public.” Inside the news division, some producers have invoked the ghost of NBC’s campaign-coverage past: the “Commander-In-Chief Forum,” a September 2016 prime-time special featuring back-to-back interviews with Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton before an audience of veterans and service members. The event was a ratings bonanza — nearly 15 million watched on NBC and MSNBC — but its moderator, Matt Lauer, a star “Today” anchor, was savaged by critics who said he had bullied Mrs. Clinton and deferred to Mr. Trump. Mr. Lauer is long gone from the network, and the NBC News chairman who oversaw the forum, Andrew Lack, left in May after a stormy tenure. The division’s current leader, Cesar Conde, previously ran Telemundo and Univision. Mr. Conde, who has limited experience with the rough-and-tumble of political coverage, issued a statement on Thursday addressing the criticism. “We share in the frustration that our event will initially air alongside the first half of ABC’s broadcast with Vice President Biden. Our decision is motivated only by fairness, not business considerations,” he wrote. “We aired a town hall with Vice President Biden on Oct. 5 at 8 p.m. If we were to move our town hall with President Trump to a later time slot, we would be violating our commitment to offer both campaigns access to the same audience and the same forum.” Savannah Guthrie, a litigator and a White House correspondent before she became an anchor on “Today,” will be the moderator, overseeing a group of inquisitive Florida voters while keeping tabs on a president who regularly lobs falsehoods and smears. The fallout from NBC’s scheduling decision suggests that viewers may be on high alert for any hint of a mistake. As Ms. Guthrie prepared for her hot-seat moment, one of her “Today” predecessors declared that NBC had made the wrong call. “Having dueling town halls is bad for democracy — voters should be able to watch both and I don’t think many will,” Katie Couric wrote on Twitter. Privately, anchors and producers inside NBC News said they were perplexed, and in some cases dismayed, by the decision to schedule Mr. Trump against Mr. Biden. They expressed pride in their coverage of Mr. Trump’s tenure, particularly given the president’s frequent taunting of MSNBC (“MSDNC”) and its parent company, Comcast (“Concast”). At a rally in North Carolina on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on Comcast, as well as the “NBC Nightly News” anchor Lester Holt, the “Meet the Press” moderator Chuck Todd and Ms. Guthrie. “She’s always lovely,” he said of Ms. Guthrie, with apparent sarcasm.
