But the onset of the pandemic helped shape and crystallize his policy plans. His approach stands in stark contrast to that of President Trump: Mr. Biden wants to actively mobilize federal resources in addressing the pandemic, an expansion to the government’s role in health care that he hopes will endure beyond the coronavirus. Today, we speak to Alexander Burns, a national political correspondent, about Mr. Biden’s plans for dealing with the current crisis and beyond.
