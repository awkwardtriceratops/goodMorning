From an office complex in the Primorsky District of St. Petersburg, employees logged on to the internet via a proxy service and set about flooding Russia’s popular social networking sites with opinions handed to them by their bosses. The shadowy organization, which according to one employee filled 40 rooms, industrialized the art of “trolling.” On this week’s Sunday Read, Adrien Chen shares his reporting from 2015 on trolling and the agency, and, eventually, becomes a victim of Russian misinformation himself.
