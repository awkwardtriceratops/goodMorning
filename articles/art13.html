But this one was open 88 years ago, during Prohibition. By Devorah Lev-Tov About 30 miles north of Poughkeepsie, in the small town of Pine Plains, is Ryan Road. Quiet and flanked by farmland, it has a discreet turnoff onto a long, gravelly driveway. At the end of that is a large, new-looking barn, with revelers sitting outside at picnic tables, sipping cocktails and eating pizza and s’mores. Inside the barn is a state-of-the-art distillery, bar, and tasting room. But take away the picnic tables, food trucks and day drinkers, and the distillery looks like any other farm in Dutchess County, just the way it did during Prohibition, when it was one of the largest producers of moonshine in New York State. All that came to an end in October 1932, when federal agents raided it. According to a local paper of the time, the distillery at Ryan Farm “was one of the most extensive and elaborate layouts ever found in this part of the country.” This fall, the curious site, revamped for modern day trippers, reopened as Dutch’s Spirits. It is part of a growing trend of distilleries that have cropped up across the state since Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo introduced the Craft New York Act in 2014, easing regulations on farm distillers. These days, with well over 100 craft distillers across the state, New York trails only California, according to a 2018 report by the Craft Spirits Association. Many farm distilleries have met the moment with pandemic-friendly and rustic-chic outdoor seating. One has an art gallery and an adjoining farm-to-table restaurant; another was built in and around an old firehouse from 1929. But Dutch’s claim to fame is the very thing that caused its demise 88 years ago: It used to be illegal. To that end, its house spirit is moonshine, and its owner hopes to cash in on the farm’s gangster lore. Bunkers and a tunnel system — for storage and escape routes — are still on the property, said Brendan McAlpine, the current distillery owner. He plans to open them up for tours. According to newspaper accounts from the 1930s, only two Polish immigrants were arrested in the raid; it is believed the rest of the workers escaped through the tunnel system.
