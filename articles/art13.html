Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, who was detained at the airport, is the first high-ranking Mexican military official to be taken into custody in the U.S. in connection with drug-related corruption. By Azam Ahmed MEXICO CITY — A former Mexican defense minister was arrested on Thursday night after arriving at Los Angeles International Airport with his family, according to the Mexican government, becoming the first high-ranking military official to be taken into custody in the United States in connection with drug-related corruption in his country. The former official, Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, who was Mexico’s defense minister from 2012 to 2018, was arrested by American officials at the request of the Drug Enforcement Administration and will face drug and money-laundering charges in the United States, according to a federal law enforcement official in New York. The news not only casts a pall over Mexico’s fight against organized crime, but also underscores the forces of corruption that touch the highest levels of the government. General Cienfuegos was defense minister throughout the administration of President Enrique Peña Nieto, who left office two years ago.
