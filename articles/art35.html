By The Editorial Board The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. American cities have sought to keep restaurants in business during the coronavirus pandemic by allowing indoor dining. With the virus spreading out of control across large swaths of the country, continuing to allow it risks an even greater public health disaster. There is ample evidence that the coronavirus spreads with ease among people eating in enclosed spaces. Yet, even as case counts climb, politicians have remained reluctant to protect public health by imposing painful restrictions, instead relying on cosmetic measures — hoping that they will appear to be doing something even as they are effectively doing nothing. A growing number of municipalities and states have imposed curfews on restaurants and bars, as if the virus were a vampire. Last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California advised diners in his state to “keep your mask on in between bites.” That is absurd. The promising news about coronavirus vaccine trials offers growing reason for optimism that sometime next year, Americans again will be able to eat safely inside their favorite restaurants. What the public interest requires for now is a suspension of indoor dining in areas where the virus is spreading, combined with federal aid to keep restaurants in business. TRANSCRIPT Georgia was one of the last states to lock down and was one of the first states to reopen. I chose to open my restaurant as soon as the coronavirus restrictions were lifted here in Georgia. We’re in week four. My staff are healthy. My guests are healthy. The spike has not come back. My name is Jenna Aronowitz. I’m the owner of 1920 Tavern in Roswell, Georgia. Currently we are only allowing 50 percent capacity, but I’d like to get to full capacity and give people the option to behave in the manner that they feel that they want to behave. If they feel comfortable coming to a full restaurant, then do it. If you don’t, then don’t. But at least give me the opportunity to make a profit. “Subject to the specific social-distancing and sanitation mandates, theaters, private social clubs and restaurant dine-in services will be allowed to reopen on Monday, April the 27th. When Georgia’s Governor Brian Kemp announced that we could open, we all jumped for joy. We were running out of money. And not just me, but my staff. Let me put it this way. This is my home and the staff that work here are my family. And if I’m not able to take care of my home and my family — was I scared of getting the virus? No. I was scared of losing my business.” “As a parent, I am concerned. Because what I know is that when I look at the data that we receive from our public health department each day, our numbers are going up.” “Georgia has the 14th-highest infection rate. But at this point, we’re still the seventh-lowest testing rate in the country.” I have been criticized on Facebook, Twitter, NextDoor. A lot of them have called me irresponsible, a money grabber, stupid. I don’t just have my children and my husband relying on me. I’ve got a lot of people relying on me. And for people to say that I’m being irresponsible really, really hurt me. We follow every single one of the 39 guidelines to the letter. There was a lot of responsibility and I didn’t take it lightly. All tables are equally spaced. We actually went a little further than six feet and did 10 feet. On each table is hand sanitizer. And most tables we don’t seat. We have them x’d off with masking tape so it’s very easy for guests to see. And this is my bartender Jamie. As soon as he’s finished making a drink, he washes his hands so that we don’t cross contaminate. And part of the requirements is that all my kitchen guys are all wearing masks. And thermometer, making sure we check temperatures of guests and staff. I don’t want anybody getting sick. I don’t want to have to live with myself if, God forbid, somebody dies. So I’m taking this extremely seriously. 50 percent, I think we could break even. At 75 percent capacity I could probably be profitable. I would love to see Governor Kemp open us up to 100 percent capacity. If restaurants don’t start opening up properly, we’re going to have a big economic problem. The restaurant industry is so big. It’s going to affect every industry around it. From meat distributor, to the farmers, to the fishermen, to, you know, the people that do my rugs. Restaurants make the economy go. The city of Roswell has received almost no liquor tax. The state of Georgia has no sales tax. And, you know, the governments themselves are starting to hurt. My mother taught me when I was a little girl that if you don’t work for something, it doesn’t mean anything. So I don’t want handouts. I’d rather the government not give any more funding and any more programs. Because ultimately, we’re going to have to pay for it. I don’t see myself as a Republican or a Democrat. I’m a business owner. Reopening my business was the right decision for me, my staff and the economy. I get that there is a balance between a human life and the balance of an economy. And the bottom line is, we need to live. Right now, being locked down is existing. Humans were not put on this earth to exist. They were put on this earth to live. The House already has passed a bill that serves the purpose. The RESTAURANTS Act — it is an acronym, but we won’t bore you with the full name — would provide up to $120 billion in grants to independent restaurants, small restaurant chains (with fewer than 20 locations) and catering firms. The aid would cover the difference between last year’s revenues and this year’s revenues, and could be used to cover most expenses, including payroll. A pending Senate version, which has bipartisan backing, would provide aid to big chains, too. McDonald’s and its ilk don’t need the money, but it’s easy to imagine a deal. Representative Earl Blumenauer, the Oregon Democrat who sponsored the House bill, said he’s been heartbroken by the growing roll call of restaurant failures in his Portland district, punching holes in the fabric of his community. The money is intended to get restaurants through winter, when outdoor dining is less tenable in many parts of the country. “It’s a bridge to better weather,” he said. Providing aid to restaurants also could make it easier for cities to suspend indoor dining. It is one of the defining perversities of the country’s response to the pandemic that many cities have kept indoor dining open while schools are closed — prioritizing economic activity over the welfare of children. New York City, which for much of the fall stood out as the rare big city where children still could learn in classrooms, announced Wednesday that it would close its schools for in-person learning, even as the city allows people to eat inside restaurants, drink in bars and exercise in gyms. Again: Children are allowed to eat in restaurants but not learn in classrooms. The public interest urgently requires an inversion of that pattern. The United States should emulate European countries, where schools have closed last, or not at all. Federal aid for restaurateurs would make it easier for local leaders to justify prohibitions on indoor dining. While that alone wouldn’t totally control the virus or reopen schools, it would help. Public health officials have warned for months that there is a clear link between indoor dining and the spread of the virus. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase have shown that in-person spending at restaurants predicts coronavirus case counts: more money, more problems. A new study due out in the journal Nature used cellphone data to reach similar conclusions. Many other kinds of businesses also need aid, of course. Workers also need aid. State and local governments also need aid. We have repeatedly urged Senate Republicans to pass a version of the broad economic aid plan that House Democrats first passed in May. But it’s clear that that’s not going to happen. Democrats can still win control of the Senate next year by prevailing in a pair of Georgia runoff elections, but that’s not soon enough. The resurgence of the virus is again disrupting economic activity, and in the absence of federal aid, the harsh reality is that many restaurants are not going to survive. There is nothing to be gained by waiting until January, or by refusing to reach agreement where agreement appears possible. Congress may not be able to do the big things, but this is a clear chance to do something. Save the nation’s restaurants — and save lives.
