Republicans accuse the executives of selective censorship. Democrats focus on misinformation and extremism. Facebook’s Zuckerberg tangles with Democrats over the election. Google’s Pichai avoids the brunt of lawmaker questions. For more than two decades, internet companies have been shielded from liability for much of what their users post by a law called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Now that shield — and how internet companies moderate content on their sites — is being questioned by lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle. On Wednesday, the chief executives of Google, Facebook and Twitter testified before a Senate committee about their moderation practices. The hearing, held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, is a repeat performance before Congress for Sundar Pichai of Google, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Jack Dorsey of Twitter. But with the Nov. 3 election less than a week away, the executives face additional pressure to manage misinformation without exerting unfair influence on the voting process. Republicans on the committee expressed concerns that Facebook, Google and Twitter made decisions about how to moderate content in ways that were slanted against conservatives, pointing to the increasing attention the issue has attracted from the party’s base. They retold anecdotes in which conservative lawmakers or media outlets had seen their content restricted or deleted on the three services. They did not present evidence that there was systematic bias across the services. Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Commerce Committee chairman, and Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado both questioned Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, about instances in which Twitter had labeled President Trump’s tweets but had not done the same for officials in repressive governments. “Mr. Dorsey, your platform allows foreign dictators to post propaganda, typically without restriction,” Mr. Wicker said, “yet you typically restrict the president of the United States.” Many of the committee’s conservatives also expressed their wariness of drastic changes in the law. Mr. Wicker said he had not yet backed a full repeal of Section 230, which protects the companies from liability for posts uploaded by users. And Mr. Gardner, who is facing a tough re-election race, said that lawmakers “have to be very careful and not rush to legislate in ways that stifle speech.” “I don’t like the idea of unelected elites in San Francisco or Silicon Valley deciding whether my speech is permissible on their platform,” Mr. Gardner said, “but I like even less the idea of unelected Washington, D.C., bureaucrats trying to enforce some kind of politically neutral content moderation.” Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican of Texas, focused on Twitter’s handling of a recent article in the New York Post about Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son, Hunter. The company initially restricted the spread of the article. “Mr. Dorsey who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the American people are allowed to hear,” Mr. Cruz said. — David McCabe Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, quickly became the primary target of Republicans at the hearing, who questioned him repeatedly on how the company handled specific tweets. Republicans have often complained that internet companies — Twitter, in particular — are unfairly silencing conservative voices. About 80 minutes into the hearing, 16 of 25 Republican questions were to Mr. Dorsey. And that was before Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, theatrically lit into Mr. Dorsey over Twitter’s recent handling of a New York Post article about Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son, Hunter Biden. Mr. Cruz, shouting at times, questioned Mr. Dorsey about Twitter’s decision to block the New York Post article from being shared. Although Twitter later reversed the decision, Mr. Cruz complained that Twitter was influencing the election and interfering with the free press. Mr. Dorsey said Twitter could not influence the vote because Americans had a variety of social media channels to communicate. He said the decision to block links to the New York Post article was “incorrect” and that it had been changed. “Mr. Dorsey, who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the American people are allowed to hear?” Mr. Cruz said. Mr. Dorsey blandly responded, “We realize we need to earn trust more,” even as the senator interrupted him. Other Republican senators said they wanted to know why Twitter added fact checks and warning labels to some of President Trump’s tweets, and criticized Mr. Dorsey for not labeling tweets from Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “I just don’t understand how you can label the president of the United States. Have you ever taken a tweet down from the ayatollah?” asked Sen. Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado. Mr. Dorsey focused his responses on broader comments about Twitter’s policies. He stressed that his companies’ rules were intended, in particular, to guard against tweets that could incite violence or harm in the offline world. He argued that Twitter had taken action on tweets from many world leaders. “The goal of our labeling is to provide more context, to connect the dots, so people can make decisions for themselves,” Mr. Dorsey said.

They also accused Republicans of holding the hearing to benefit President Trump. “I want to know first why this hearing comes six days before Election Day, and it — I believe we are politicizing and the Republican majority is politicizing what should actually not be a partisan topic,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota. Democrats were largely open to reforms of the Section 230 legal shield of internet companies, which protects the businesses from liability for posts by users. Instead, their complaints were directed at insufficient action by the tech platforms against misinformation that interferes with the election. “I hope today that we will get a report from the witnesses on exactly what they have been doing to clamp down on election interference,” said Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat in the Commerce Committee.  I hope that they will tell us what kind of hate speech and misinformation they have taken off the books.” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, pressed the companies on their plans for how they would respond to President Trump if he tried to delegitimize the election or call an election result too early. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Google’s Sundar Pichai, and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey said they all had plans, including working with The Associated Press for information and to provide results from local officials. — Cecilia Kang Republicans have focused much of their ire at the Senate Commerce hearing on Twitter’s Jack Dorsey. And Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg? He has been more of a target for Democrats. Roughly two hours into the hearing, Mr. Zuckerberg had fielded 14 out of the 21 questions from Democrats on the Senate Commerce committee, according to a tally by The New York Times. The Facebook chief executive was asked about his views on reforming Section 230, the legal shield that protects tech companies from most liability for what their users post, as well as what Facebook was doing to be ready for the Nov. 3 election. Mr. Zuckerberg, now a five-time veteran of appearing in front of Congress, took most of the questions in stride and appeared well-briefed. He rattled off the numbers of Facebook workers focused on content moderation on the social network (more than 35,000), and noted that the company was spending billions of dollars — more than Facebook’s entire 2012 revenue — on election security. Mr. Zuckerberg, who experienced a technical glitch at the start of the hearing, also livened up his surroundings from the last time he testified to lawmakers in July. At that hearing, which was about antitrust, Mr. Zuckerberg sat in a blank, white room. This time, he was flanked by curtains and a plant. It was unclear whether Mr. Zuckerberg was appearing from his home in Silicon Valley or another of his residences. Kellen Browning contributed reporting. — Mike Isaac On most days, Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, is soft-spoken — and that was ever more apparent on Wednesday. At the Senate hearing about the Section 230 legal shield for tech companies, Mr. Pichai barely spoke. More than two hours into the hearing, he had fielded just 12 of the more than 50 questions asked by the lawmakers, according to a tally by The New York Times. Instead, the panel focused on Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive. Among the limited questions directed to Mr. Pichai, lawmakers asked not about content moderation — ostensibly the subject of the hearing — but about Google’s response to an antitrust lawsuit that the Justice Department filed against the company last week. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said she found Google’s response to the lawsuit “insulting.” Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, declared, “Google has more power than any company on the face of the planet” — but didn’t actually ask a question of Mr. Pichai. The lack of questions and scrutiny mirrored how Google’s YouTube has often avoided much of the harshest criticism directed at social networks about how they police misinformation and harmful conspiracy theories on their platforms. When asked what Google was doing to prepare for attempts by President Trump to use its platform to interfere with the Nov. 3 election, Mr. Pichai repeated his talking points, saying that the company would work to elevate authoritative news sources to provide accurate information. “We have been planning for a while, and we rely on raising up our new sources through moments like that,” said Mr. Pichai, in one of his lengthiest responses.

But their evidence is largely anecdotal, and conservative accounts frequently perform extremely well online. The charges of censorship will almost certainly play a central role in Wednesday’s hearing. Republicans like Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are likely to criticize the chief executives about how their platforms have moderated content posted by conservative politicians or right-wing media outlets. Conservatives have seized on individual instances of content moderation to claim that there is a systemic bias against them on the platforms. In some cases, the companies have said that the content violated their policies; in other instances they have said that the moderation was a mistake. Recently, Republicans pointed to the decision by Twitter and Facebook to restrict the sharing of stories about Hunter Biden, the son of Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee for president. Twitter initially said that the story violated its policy against the sharing of hacked information, but later reversed itself. Facebook has said it is restricting the story’s reach while it waits for a third-party fact checker to evaluate the claims. In 2017, Twitter took down an ad for Ms. Blackburn’s Senate campaign after the company deemed it “inflammatory” for a line that included a reference to “the sale of baby body parts,” saying the post violated its policies. The company changed its mind a day later. In 2016, Facebook had to answer questions from conservatives about whether its Trending Topics section, which at the time was run by human curators, not the algorithms that power its News Feed, had suppressed conservative news. The company said it found no evidence that the accusations were true. None of these cases unearthed evidence of a systemic bias against conservative content. A 2019 study by The Economist found that Google did not favor left-leaning websites. Posts from commentators like Ben Shapiro regularly rank among the most highly-engaged on Facebook. Liberals have also had their posts flagged or removed from the platforms — groups that advocate for racial justice, for example have said that Facebook has taken their content down. Democrats have accused Republicans of raising the issue to manipulate Silicon Valley companies into being more cautious when it comes to moderating false or misleading information posted by conservatives. “There’s simply no reason to have this hearing just prior to the election, except that it may intimidate the platforms, who have shown themselves to be vulnerable to political blunt force in the past,” Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, wrote in a tweet this month about Wednesday’s hearing. — David McCabe It used to be unusual to see a top tech executive face tough questioning before lawmakers on Capitol Hill. But that has changed in the past few years. Now, the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter are old hands at Congressional hearings. The hearing on Wednesday will be the fifth time Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook has testified before lawmakers; the third time for Sundar Pichai of Google; and the third for Jack Dorsey of Twitter. All of the appearances have taken place in the past three years. The hearings have been a boon to law firms in Washington that prepare the chief executives. WilmerHale has been on Facebook’s retainer for years, for example, and has now prepped Mr. Zuckerberg for all hearings since his first in March 2018. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
