Brusdar Graterol faced three batters, got two outs and allowed a single to Mike Zunino. In came Julio Urias, who has been terrific for the Dodgers this postseason, to get the final out of the inning. Urias last pitched in Game 4 on Saturday, when he tossed four and two-thirds innings. If Urias stays efficient, Roberts could use him to at least get to the ninth inning, if not more, with the Dodgers leading 2-1. Two back-end relievers Blake Treinen and Kenley Jansen are looming for Los Angeles. The Dodgers got two men on base in the bottom of the seventh — a double by Will Smith and an intentional walk of pinch-hitter Joc Pederson — but couldn’t bring another runner home. By James Wagner More stout pitching by the Dodgers bullpen, which has done the heavy lifting tonight. Victor Gonzalez struck out the side in the sixth inning. He also notched the final out of the fifth inning. The Dodgers’ bullpen has allowed just one hit since starter Tony Gonsolin was pulled from the game with two outs in the second inning. Blake Snell didn’t look happy — and appeared to mutter an expletive to himself — when he saw his manager, Kevin Cash, walking toward him to remove him from the game. Snell coughed up a one-out single to Austin Barnes — only his second hit allowed all game — and Cash hooked him after only 73 pitches. In came Nick Anderson, who was one of the best relievers in baseball during the regular season but has looked worn down this postseason. He had allowed at least one run in six straight appearances entering Tuesday. And all Snell could do was watch from the dugout when Anderson coughed up a double to Mookie Betts, Barnes scored on a wild pitch and then Betts gave the Dodgers a 2-1 lead on Corey Seager’s fielder’s choice. By James Wagner Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts is emptying his bullpen. He used Pedro Baez (for two outs) and Victor Gonzalez (for the final out) to complete the fifth inning. Gonzalez was the fifth Dodgers pitcher of the night. All of those different looks on the mound can make it harder for hitters, but it also means a lesser pitcher might be forced into the game, and Roberts has several more innings to cover. Blake Snell, meanwhile, has continued to plow through the Dodgers lineup. He has allowed just one hit through five innings. The last time he completed six innings? Shockingly, it was July 21, 2019. Rays Manager Kevin Cash has been quick to yank his starter before they run into trouble the third time through an opponent’s order. Snell didn’t face a lineup three times many times in 2020. But the few times he did, they hit .304 with a .913 on-base-plus-slugging percentage against him. In his career, the numbers are much better in this instances: .247 with a .742 O.P.S. By James Wagner Another 1-2-3 inning from Alex Wood. Maybe he should have started instead of Tony Gonsolin? For the Rays, shortstop Willy Adames helped his team get this far with fabulous defense and his contagiously cheerful attitude, but not with his bat. He was 8 for 55 (.145) with 22 strikeouts this postseason entering Game 6. So far, he is 0 for 2 tonight with two strikeouts on a grand total of nine pitches. Blake Snell is cruising. He is making some of the best Dodgers hitters, such as Mookie Betts in the third inning and Corey Seager in the fourth inning, look silly. He has mostly kept the ball away from the middle of the plate and gotten the normally patient Dodgers to chase pitches out of the zone with the count at two strikes. Snell struck out the side in the fourth inning on 16 pitches. He has fanned nine in all over four innings on only 55 pitches. He is poised to go very deep into this game, but the Rays have given him little margin for error. They still lead only 1-0. By James Wagner Alex Wood produced the Dodgers’ first 1-2-3 inning of the game — against the heart of the Rays’ batting order, no less. Wood has traditionally been a starter, but has pitched mostly out of the bullpen this season. Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts will most likely need Wood for several more innings as a bridge to the back end of the bullpen — Blake Treinen, Brusdar Graterol and Kenley Jansen. In the bottom half of the inning, the Dodgers made Blake Snell work for the first time. Chris Taylor led off with a single, but Snell wriggled out of the inning with some help from third baseman Joey Wendle, who is a standout defender because of his quick first step and sure hands. Wendle snared a line drive by A.J. Pollock and made a nifty play down the third base line on a ground ball by Austin Barnes. Snell struck out Mookie Betts with a high 98 m.p.h. fastball for the third out. If there has been any weakness in the Dodgers’ offense, which led the major leagues in runs scored during the regular season, it has been against left-handers. They posted an .837 on-base-plus-slugging percentage against right-handed pitchers, second best in baseball. But against southpaws, they had a .778 O.P.S., seventh best. By James Wagner If the Rays are going to force a Game 7, they will need more help from hitters not named Randy Arozarena. Kevin Kiermaier, who has had a good World Series at the plate, is now 7 for 17 in the series after his second-inning double with one out. But the Rays did nothing else with a runner in scoring position as Mike Zunino struck out, Ji-Man Choi walked and then Arozarena struck out. Reliever Dylan Floro, not starter Tony Gonsolin, faced Arozarena. Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts didn’t want Gonsolin facing Arozarena again, as Arozarena homered off him in the first inning. Gonsolin faced 10 batters, got five outs, surrendered three hits, walked two, struck out four, threw 48 pitches and was pulled. Floro fanned Arozarena on three pitches, all changeups. Blake Snell, the Rays’ starter, has looked as sharp so far as he has in any other start this postseason. He located his hard fastball well, while also showing good feel for his changeup, curveball and slider. He has induced some bad swings from Dodgers hitters and struck out five through two innings on only 24 pitches. Remember: Snell hasn’t completed six innings this postseason. The Rays may need that tonight. By James Wagner What else is there to say about this guy? Randy Arozarena, the Rays’ breakout slugger, added to his major league record for most home runs in a single postseason, hitting his 10th in the first inning of Game 6 to give the Rays a 1-0 lead. He smashed an 89-mile-per-hour slider from Dodgers starter Tony Gonsolin. It wasn’t a bad pitch — it was just outside the strike zone — but Arozarena is so locked in and so strong that he flicked his bat and sent the ball over the right field fence. Gonsolin wasn’t sharp the rest of the inning. Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts had left-hander Alex Wood warming in the bullpen after Gonsolin allowed two men on with only one out. Roberts stuck with Gonsolin, who escaped with no further damage but needed 25 pitches in all. In the bottom of the frame, Rays starter Blake Snell looked much stronger, striking out the side on 12 pitches, including a 97 m.p.h. fastball to fan Justin Turner. By James Wagner Enrique Hernandez, a Dodgers utility player since 2015, said this when asked what the talk around the team was entering Game 6 of the World Series on Tuesday: “That we hope the roof is closed because it’s freezing.” It was expected to be around 40 degrees and foggy in Arlington, Texas, by first pitch. Hernandez and the Dodgers got their wish: The roof at Globe Life Field has been closed. Hernandez said this year’s Dodgers were actually better than the ones that also reached the World Series in 2017 and 2018. The biggest difference: star outfielder Mookie Betts, who was acquired in a trade with the Boston Red Sox over the winter. “I feel like there’s been a lot of times where we’ve sat as a group or we’ve sat in front of you guys and talked internally and to you guys about how this is the best team we’ve ever played on,” Hernandez told reporters before Tuesday’s game. “This season, I think we can all agree that this is the best team we’ve seen since we’ve been here.” By James Wagner During their day off on Monday, with a potential elimination game looming, the Rays did their best to distract themselves from their World Series deficit. They gathered in an area of their quarantine hotel near Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, for a catered meal of local food. “I liked the barbecue a lot,” said Rays Manager Kevin Cash, who had grown tired of the room service food from the hotel. Most of the team sat around, ate and talked, which was a good opportunity to relax and get their minds off baseball, said shortstop Willy Adames. Some players have said throughout this unusual season that it has been harder to get their minds off work, particularly when they’re struggling, because of the health and safety restrictions that have confined them to their hotels or stadiums on the road. They can’t go on walks, meet up with friends or family or go to a restaurant as they used to. “We didn’t really talk about baseball,” Adames said. “We were just talking about life and a lot of stuff. It’s always good to learn from the old guys.” Asked who those old guys were, Adames, 25, listed pitcher Charlie Morton, 36, who is slated to start a potential Game 7, and then said that almost everyone on the team is older than he is. Among those players is first baseman Ji-Man Choi, 29, a left-handed hitter who is in the leadoff spot for the Rays on Tuesday night against the Dodgers’ right-handed starter, Tony Gonsolin. “We’re just looking for a spark,” Cash said. Choi, who had mostly been in the cleanup spot this month, is hitting .263 with two home runs and nine walks this postseason. As far as the team’s mood facing elimination, the Rays insisted they felt as relaxed as usual. “It’s pretty cool to see a team not waver too much,” said Rays catcher Mike Zunino. By James Wagner The Dodgers’ last title was in 1988 — when Tommy Lasorda was their manager and pitcher Orel Hershiser their star — but they have come close a few times since. In the 2018 World Series, they were dispatched in five games by the Boston Red Sox, who had one of the best seasons in baseball history. In the 2017 World Series, the Dodgers came even closer to snapping their title drought by forcing a Game 7 against the Houston Astros, but then they lost that final contest, 5-1. But both of those Series opponents, the Astros in particular, now have clouds hanging over them. They have been penalized by Major League Baseball for sign-stealing schemes that broke the rules in each of those seasons. (M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred wrote in his report on the Astros that their rule-breaking continued during the 2017 postseason, but concluded in a later report that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the Red Sox had used in-game video to decode signs during the 2018 postseason.) </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
