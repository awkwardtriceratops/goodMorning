They’re wrong. Hi, we’re the new G.O.P. And we have no plan for America. Whether it’s civil unrest, health care, immigration, or affordable housing, we promise to literally copy and paste our 2016 platform, because nothing has changed since then. When coronavirus hit our shores and killed nearly 200,000 Americans, people called for stronger lockdowns and universal mask wearing, pushing their have-a-plan agenda. They were wrong. Winging it and hoping it got better was the key to our success. And when the economy crashed, sending tens of millions out of work, planning extremists called for additional stimulus and to extend emergency unemployment benefits. We pushed back by standing our ground while those expired. Read for yourself about our zero-step process to continue doing nothing for anyone. Vote for the G.O.P. Vote Republican, because plans are dumb. 15:38 14:17 17:28 NOW PLAYING 5:22 22:21 5:06 2:45 7:14 10:54 6:57 4:01 </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
