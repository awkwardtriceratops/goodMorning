A crucial question remains, however: Who will control the Senate? All eyes are on two unfinished races in Georgia, where runoff elections will be held in January. The Democrats face a tall order: They must win both seats to have a Senate advantage. Will Mr. Biden have both houses of Congress on his side to implement his agenda? Or will he have to work with an upper chamber under Republican control? With so much at stake, we look at how the runoffs in Georgia might shake out.
