Why this vice-presidential debate could be far different from its predecessors. Biden says if Trump ‘still has Covid, we shouldn’t have a debate. How to watch tonight’s vice-presidential debate. What polling tells us ahead of the debate. Republicans are spending $60 million on a digital get-out-the-vote campaign. An attack ad targets a non-politician: Mark Zuckerberg. Vice-presidential debates — like tonight’s — are usually low-voltage affairs. That’s not to say there isn’t plenty of spirited argument, but they usually aren’t particularly well watched nor do they have much of an impact on the outcome. People vote for the president. Consider this: The most famous moment in vice-presidential debating history was arguably the notorious put-down from Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic candidate for vice president in 1988, delivered to Dan Quayle, George H.W. Bush’s running mate. “Senator, you’re no Jack Kennedy,” he said, after Mr. Quayle had compared himself to John F. Kennedy. So will the contest between Vice President Mike Pence and Kamala Harris break the mold? It might. It comes at a huge moment in American politics. President Trump recently emerged from the hospital after falling ill with the coronavirus. The disease has swept through the White House. The debate offers a platform for the vivid divide that has emerged over the past 48 hours between Mr. Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. on the seriousness of a pandemic that has killed more than 210,000 Americans. Mr. Trump left the hospital proclaiming that the virus wasn’t so bad, minimizing its danger and impact. The Pence campaign resisted a debate commission rule to have him and Ms. Harris stand behind a protective plexiglass barrier, before finally acquiescing. Few issues distinguish the presidential candidates as much as the virus. Mr. Trump said he was well enough to take part in the next presidential debate, on Oct. 15, but anyone who has struggled with this disease can attest to the fact that eight days is a long way away. And the president could still be contagious next week, which would make him a danger to others. Tonight’s debate could conceivably end up being the last one of the campaign, and Ms. Harris and Mr. Pence are certainly aware of the extra burden they carry. Most vice-presidential debates are a blur of grabby quotations: The candidates will parry between defending their standard-bearer and attacking the opposition. But tonight, perhaps more than ever in a vice-presidential debate, Ms. Harris and Mr. Pence will be standing as proxies for the men who want to be in the White House, and debating at what could well be remembered as one of the most critical junctures in the nation’s history. — Adam Nagourney Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Tuesday night that there should not be a presidential debate next week in Miami if President Trump “still has Covid,” just hours after Mr. Trump said he intended to participate in the event. Asked by reporters on Tuesday night whether he would feel safe debating Mr. Trump, who was hospitalized last week with the coronavirus, Mr. Biden responded: “I think if he still has Covid, we shouldn’t have a debate.” But Mr. Biden said his decision would be guided by the Cleveland Clinic and doctors. “I think we were going to have to follow very strict guidelines,” he said. “Too many people have been infected. It’s a very serious problem, so I will be guided by the guidelines of the Cleveland Clinic and what the docs say is the right thing to do.” Mr. Biden’s remarks introduced new uncertainty into the debate calendar and whether either of the two remaining presidential debates would go forward as scheduled. People with mild to moderate cases of the illness are likely to “remain infectious no longer than 10 days after symptom onset,” according to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But that period could be doubled in cases of more serious illness. Mr. Biden, who shared a debate stage with the president a week ago, tested negative for the coronavirus again on Tuesday, his campaign said. Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday that he planned to attend the next presidential debate, even as he remains infectious and doctors warned that the course of his illness is unpredictable. Mr. Biden’s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, will face off against Vice President Mike Pence in the vice-presidential debate on Wednesday in Salt Lake City. The two candidates will be 12 feet 3 inches apart, an increase from the seven feet that was originally proposed; they will also be separated by plexiglass, though aides to Mr. Pence said on Tuesday that they thought the barriers were unnecessary. The Biden-Harris campaign said Wednesday that Ms. Harris tested negative for the virus. on Tuesday. — Sydney Ember The debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Kamala Harris takes place on Wednesday night from 9 to 10:30 p.m. Eastern. Here are some of the many ways you can watch it: The Times will livestream the debate, and our reporters will provide commentary and analysis. The debate will be televised on channels including ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News and MSNBC. Many news outlets, including ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, Fox News and C-SPAN, will stream the debate on YouTube. The Roku Channel will carry streams from several news outlets. The streaming network Newsy will carry the debate on several platforms. As they prepare for their debate, Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris are confronting an electorate that is more or less divided. About one-fifth of voters say they don’t have much of an opinion of each candidate, but among those who do, strong opinions outnumber mildly favorable or unfavorable views. Here’s what polling can tell us about the candidates and the debate. Ms. Harris is unlikely to let Mr. Pence easily escape the fact that he was appointed to lead the White House’s coronavirus response — an effort that a wide majority of Americans not only disapprove of, but also have come to resent. More than two-thirds of Americans said in an Axios/Ipsos poll late last month that they had little confidence in the federal government to look out for their best interests when it comes to the pandemic. Still, in CNN polling conducted after President Trump announced his positive coronavirus test results on Friday, 62 percent of Americans said they thought Mr. Pence was qualified to serve as president. Just 35 percent said they didn’t think so. (Men were 12 points more likely than women to find him qualified.) Ms. Harris tends to fare slightly better than Mr. Pence in public perception and, on average, national polling shows that more Americans view her positively than negatively. In a Monmouth poll from early September, 43 percent gave her positive marks, and 37 percent saw her negatively. As with Mr. Pence, one in five said they had no opinion. Despite widespread concern over the virus, recent polling showed that a large majority of Americans wanted the debates to go forward. More than three-quarters of likely voters in both Pennsylvania and Florida told New York Times/Siena College pollsters last week that they thought the other two presidential debates should go ahead as planned. But many of those respondents were contacted before Mr. Trump announced he had tested positive. In the CNN poll taken after his diagnosis was made public, 63 percent of Americans said they thought the president had acted irresponsibly toward those around him in handling the risk of infection. That included more than seven in 10 women, and even a majority of white people without college degrees, a core Trump constituency. While he has tested negative in recent days, Mr. Pence attended a White House event that has been linked to numerous officials who have since tested positive. Medical experts say there is still a chance that he could be carrying the virus. Americans have consistently said in polls that they preferred to lean toward caution on lifting virus restrictions. — Giovanni Russonello With voting underway in more than 30 states, the Republican National Committee has begun a $60 million digital get-out-the-vote campaign that will harness social media, text messaging, email and other platforms to digitally chase voters. The expansive effort leverages the vast data operation the party has built over the past three years, and will involve quickly filling the newsfeeds, inboxes and text threads of potential voters with information on how to vote and reminders about key deadlines. “We can target you every step of the way,” said Richard Walters, the chief of staff of the R.N.C. “We know when you requested the ballot, and we know to continue following up with you until your ballot has been returned, and until we can see it has been returned.” The initiative will complement the operations of the Trump campaign’s digital team, which will primarily focus on running persuasion ads, according to officials at the R.N.C. While a crucial part of the digital get-out-the-vote effort will be persuading Republican voters who have requested an absentee ballot to turn it in, possibly by mail, it is a message that runs counter to President Trump’s frequent and baseless denunciations of mail ballots, which he called a “disaster” in the first presidential debate, suggesting without evidence that they would lead to a “rigged election.” Mr. Trump has, however, sought to distinguish between mail-in ballots and absentee ballots by arguing, falsely, that the latter is less prone to fraud. (There are no meaningful differences between the two.) To counter any confusion, the R.N.C. has identified which voters are likely to vote by mail, regardless of the public message, and are encouraging them to send in their ballots. — Nick Corasaniti In the final weeks of the election, ads will air across the country attacking President Trump, Joseph R. Biden Jr., incumbent senators and representatives, their challengers — even sheriffs won’t be spared. But on Wednesday, a political group will take aim at a familiar yet rarely targeted figure in public policy: Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook. A new ad from Accountable Tech, a nonprofit group that includes former Facebook employees, former election officials and members of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, uses Mr. Zuckerberg’s own remarks to highlight what the group sees as Facebook’s failures to protect the country from dangerous disinformation and violent criminals. “It’s not enough to just give people a voice — we need to make sure that people aren’t using it to harm other people or to spread misinformation,” Mr. Zuckerberg is heard saying in the ad, in remarks from his 2018 testimony before Congress. As he speaks, scenes of right-wing groups at protests and people clad in gear supporting the QAnon conspiracy theory fill the screen, mixed with headlines like “Facebook Tried to Limit Qanon. It Failed.” The ads will run nationally on CNN before and after the vice-presidential debate, as well as on digital platforms. Accountable Tech was founded this year and has pushed social media companies to be more aggressive in policing their platforms for dangerous disinformation and incitements to violence. Most of the group’s efforts have targeted Facebook. On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would remove any group, page or Instagram account that openly identified with QAnon. — Nick Corasaniti Senator Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona, and her Democratic challenger, Mark Kelly, attempted to shed their party labels Tuesday night and reach out to independent voters in their only debate for the seat Ms. McSally was appointed to in 2018. Ms. McSally, a former fighter pilot who has consistently trailed Mr. Kelly in the polls, refused to say whether she was proud of her support for President Trump and whether she would want to serve under him in the Air Force. Mr. Kelly, a former astronaut, refused to say whether he would support Senator Chuck Schumer as the Senate majority leader. The special election is being watched closely, not just because it is for one of a handful of seats Democrats hope to flip in their bid to gain control of the Senate, but because if Mr. Kelly wins, he could conceivably be seated in time to vote on President Trump’s nominee for Supreme Court, Judge Amy Coney Barrett. The candidates sparred over the coronavirus as Mr. Kelly attempted to make the debate a referendum on the president and health care, arguing that Ms. McSally voted to undermine or eliminate protection for pre-existing conditions while the president has bungled the nation’s response to the virus. “I can’t think of one instance where Senator McSally has stood up when the president has made a mistake or when the governor did something that wasn’t right,” Mr. Kelly said, referring to Arizona’s Republican governor, Doug Ducey. While acknowledging that “mistakes were made at all levels,” Ms. McSally attempted to use the virus to pivot to Mr. Kelly’s business ties to China, saying he was too beholden to the communist country to hold it accountable for “unleashing” the virus on the world. “While I’m standing up to China to hold them accountable, my opponent, starting in 2003 while he was serving in the U.S. Navy, went over to China on an all-expenses paid junket paid for by the Chinese Communist Party to help influence elites in America,” she said. Both candidates emphasized their support for law enforcement, border security and the Second Amendment. — Hank Stephenson Ballots in Arizona that have missing signatures must be corrected by a voter before Election Day, rather than five days after, in order for their vote to count, a federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday. The decision in Arizona affects what is known as the ballot “curing” process, in which a voter is contacted by an election official if there is an issue with their absentee ballot and given an opportunity to fix the issue. Not all states in the country offer ballot curing. The ruling from the Ninth District Court of Appeals was a victory for Republicans, who had appealed a decision from a lower court that voters should be given five days after Election Day to fix missing signatures. “All ballots must have some deadline, and it is reasonable that Arizona has chosen to make that deadline Election Day itself so as to promote its unquestioned interest in administering an orderly election and to facilitate its already burdensome job of collecting, verifying, and counting all of the votes in timely fashion,” the court said in its opinion. Arizona had recently passed a law allowing voters who had “mismatched” signatures — ones that didn’t match the ones on file — to fix their ballots up to five days after Election Day, but the law did not extend to missing signatures. The Arizona Democratic Party sued, and a lower court ruled in their favor. But the Ninth Circuit found that “a five-day grace period beyond Election Day to supply missing signatures would indeed increase the administrative burdens on the State to some extent.” The decision comes as hundreds of cases are still pending around the country, leaving the rules and regulations by which ballots will be cast and counted in November uncertain. — Nick Corasaniti Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will face high stakes and plenty of scrutiny in tonight’s vice-presidential debate.
