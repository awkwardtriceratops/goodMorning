Apple continues to suspend fees for some apps, including Facebook. A Boeing parts suppler files for bankruptcy as the pandemic weighs on aviation. The latest: Lufthansa seeks to cut more than 1,000 pilot jobs. China restarts construction, sending the price of metals higher. Wall Street rose on Friday, shaking off an unsteady start, as a rally in technology stocks lifted the broader market. The S&P 500 climbed 1.6 percent. The technology heavy Nasdaq composite rose 2.3 percent. Amazon, Microsoft and Apple were each sharply higher. Companies that have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on travel and tourism led the gains on Friday. Norwegian Cruise Line rose more than 13 percent, and Carnival Corporation, MGM Resorts and Boeing were all sharply higher. Still, stocks were lower for the week, the fourth consecutive weekly drop for the S&P 500. European stocks have also mostly tumbled this week after a surge in coronavirus cases has led several European governments to mandate tighter restrictions, further clouding the timeline for a recovery. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 fell more than 5 percent this week. Investors are watching developments in Washington closely. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that he and Speaker Nancy Pelosi had agreed to resume talks on another economic relief package. The remarks moved markets higher. But at the same congressional hearing, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, underscored the need for fiscal support. Without more help, “we’ll see sooner or later, probably sooner, that the economy has a hard time sustaining the growth that we’ve seen — that’s the risk,” Mr. Powell said.  — Kevin Granville and Mohammed Hadi The head of the Federal Aviation Administration, Stephen Dickson, plans to pilot a Boeing 737 Max next Wednesday as the regulator moves closer to certifying the plane for flight. Mr. Dickson, a pilot and former Delta Air Lines executive, had said the agency would not lift its March 2019 grounding order on the Max until he flew the plane himself. “I am not going to sign off on this aircraft until I fly it myself and am satisfied that I would put my own family on it without a second thought,” he said in a staff memo last year. The flight will take place in Seattle, where Mr. Dickson will first receive the training for Max pilots recommended by the F.A.A. and a group of aviation authorities from Canada, the European Union and Brazil, the agency said in a statement. The F.A.A. is currently reviewing comments it received on the proposed order to lift the grounding. The Max was grounded after 346 people were killed in two fatal crashes, in Indonesia and Ethiopia. In a report this month, the Democratic majority on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee described those crashes as the “horrific culmination” of engineering flaws, mismanagement and a severe lack of federal oversight. The plane is expected to fly again as soon as this winter. It will return to an aviation industry that has been hammered by the coronavirus pandemic. Many airlines have canceled orders for the Max and other planes because they do not anticipate ticket sales to recover fully for several years. — Niraj Chokshi Apple continued to temporarily waive its App Store fees for companies that have moved their services online in the pandemic, as it faces growing frustration from app developers. On Friday, Facebook said it was among the companies that had its fees suspended by Apple until the end of the year. Apple normally charges app developers a 30 percent cut for purchases of digital goods inside apps. But as activities like yoga, concerts and cooking classes have moved online in the pandemic, service providers have complained about paying the fees. In July, The New York Times reported that Apple had suspended collecting its 30 percent fee for ClassPass, a start-up that offers fitness classes, after it moved its classes online. In addition, Airbnb, which offers virtual activities; Eventbrite, which sells tickets to events; and MindBody, a fitness app, have been granted temporary suspensions of the fees, an Apple spokesman said. The companies will pay the 30 percent fee after the end of the year. Facebook began offering the ability for business owners to sell access to live events through its app over the summer. Apple’s 30 percent cut on that feature is now suspended through the end of the year. The fee waiver does not apply to purchases made on digital games within Facebook. The power that Apple and Google wield over their app stores have been scrutinized by regulators and lawmakers. Apple is also fighting off a lawsuit over the matter with Epic Games, the maker of the popular game Fortnite. This week, more than a dozen app developers formed a coalition to push for changes to Google and Apple’s app store policies and “protect the app economy.” — Erin Griffith Impresa Aerospace, a parts supplier to Boeing, filed for bankruptcy on Thursday, citing a “perfect storm” created by the global grounding of the 737 Max and the pandemic’s effect on commercial aviation. In its filing, Impresa, which has nearly 150 employees, said that Boeing was the company’s largest customer and that the Max program “is (or was)” Impresa’s largest source of revenue. Most of the company’s growth from 2016 to 2019 was fueled by preparation for production of the Max, which Boeing had projected would reach 57 planes per month this year. Instead, after two fatal crashes, the Max was grounded worldwide in March 2019 and will likely remain so until at least this winter. The pandemic’s toll on air travel has led airlines to retrench, dealing another blow to Boeing, which has lost more than 900 net orders for planes this year and has a backlog of just over 4,000. Boeing suspended 737 production in January and said in July that it expected to reach a rate of 31 per month by 2022. “The effects of the 737 Max grounding and the Covid-19 pandemic have been particularly acute because of the nature of the commercial aerospace supply chain,” Impresa said in the filing. Impresa has long-term agreements with Boeing and others, but orders are not guaranteed. As a result, the company is on the hook for $10 million of materials that it no longer needs and that it doesn’t expect to be able to pay. Twin Haven Capital Partners, a private equity firm that is the majority owner of Impresa, offered to buy the company out of bankruptcy for $10 million, according to the filing. — Niraj Chokshi The German airline Lufthansa has more than 1,000 more pilots than it needs and is talking to their union about job reductions, the airline said Friday. A spokesman for Lufthansa, which has about 5,000 pilots, said that some of the cuts could probably be achieved by early retirements or reduced flying hours, but that forced layoffs might be necessary. The European Commission said on Friday that it would appeal a July court ruling that struck down an order forcing Apple to pay more than 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland, home to the company’s European headquarters. The court defeat was a setback for European regulators who have acted aggressively against Silicon Valley companies. Led by Margrethe Vestager, the top antitrust official in the European Union, the commission has accused Apple of receiving unfair tax treatment in Ireland in violation of European Union laws. Apple and Ireland have said the arrangement was within the law. Costco reported a 14.1 percent increase in comparable sales for the quarter that ended on Aug. 30, excluding gas and currency effects. The company’s sales jump is nearly twice as high as the spring quarter, when Costco struggled to keep items in stock after the virus struck and Americans rushed to buy groceries, toilet paper, and cleaning supplies. The company reported profit of about $1.4 billion, compared with roughly $1.1 billion during the same period last year. As workers return to offices in greater numbers, managers face this inevitable situation: An employee tests positive for Covid-19, possibly exposing others at the workplace. Who should be told about it? Traders at JPMorgan Chase in Manhattan recently complained when they found out about a coronavirus case in their building via news reports. The bank only informs people on the same floor, or who have otherwise had potential contact with the infected person. That’s one way to do it, and there are others. The DealBook newsletter asked experts to debate the pros and cons of four major approaches. Tell nobody “As an employer, I owe a duty of care to all my employees. They have a right to know,” said Anthony Gentile, a partner at the law firm Godosky & Gentile. This isn’t a hypothetical question for the litigator. When employees at the 20-person New York firm tested positive early in the pandemic, everyone was alerted and the office was closed. “Do not tell nobody!” the Cornell employment law professor Stewart Schwab warned, gasping at the notion. Tell only those in possible contact This is the JPMorgan approach, shared by many other companies. The risk of telling a narrower group of people, lawyers warn, is that it may reveal, explicitly or otherwise, who tested positive — and it’s important to protect an employee’s confidentiality. More-limited disclosures may also rankle employees who work in the general vicinity but not directly with the infected person. Tell everyone in the building Technically, the workplace is a manager’s “zone of duty,” Mr. Gentile said. That could mean notifying anybody who could have shared air or space with the infected person, but he suggested circumspection with clients. Tell everyone in the company Strictly speaking, if there’s no possible contact — in a lobby, elevator or elsewhere — it’s probably not necessary for everyone to know. But wide disclosure can cultivate a culture of transparency and openness, Mr. Schwab said. (It can also become overwhelming at a big company where a lot of cases may be inevitable.) He isn’t totally sold on this approach, but isn’t opposed either. — Ephrat Livni College experts say that it will be important to apply early for financial aid this year, because many families have suffered economically during the coronavirus pandemic and may have to take extra steps to qualify for maximum help. Families should complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid — the form known as FAFSA — as soon as they can: The form is a major gateway for financial help from the federal government, as well as from many states and colleges. The FAFSA for the 2021-22 academic year is available starting Thursday. An analysis by NerdWallet found that $2.6 billion in federal need-based Pell grants went unclaimed in 2018 because eligible students failed to file the form. The upcoming FAFSA will use financial information from the 2019 tax year to determine a family’s expected out-of-pocket payment for college. But many students and families have been affected by the health crisis this year, suffering job losses, catastrophic medical bills and even deaths, said Kim Cook, executive director of the National College Attainment Network, a nonprofit advocacy group. Tax returns filed this year won’t accurately reflect students’ current financial picture, diminishing their eligibility for need-based grants and scholarships. “Families may have had significant change in circumstances,” Ms. Cook said. “It means many students have had a loss of income.” If that’s the case, students must still use the required, older tax information to complete the FAFSA, but they also should immediately contact college financial aid offices to alert them to their situation and request a review known as professional judgment. With that review, financial aid administrators have discretion to make adjustments to the FAFSA so that students can qualify for more aid. — Ann Carrns The coronavirus pandemic forced China to bring industrial activity to a halt earlier this year, but the country is revving its engines again — and global prices of metals are reflecting that renewed appetite for growth. China consumes roughly half of the world’s industrial metals, according to analysts. As the country emerged from the worst of the pandemic in March, the Chinese government unleashed a program of enormous fiscal stimulus aimed at building bridges, roads, utilities, broadband and railroads across the country. As a result, the prices of metals used to build infrastructure have surged in recent months: Since late March, prices of iron ore — the key ingredient in steel — have risen more than 40 percent. Nickel, needed for stainless steel, and zinc, used to galvanize metal, are up more than 25 percent. Copper, which is used in wiring for power transmission, construction and car manufacturing, and has long been seen as a barometer for the world’s industrial economy, is also up around 35 percent. “China, as usual, went the investment route and is massively investing in metals-intensive infrastructure,” said Caroline Bain, a commodities market analyst with Capital Economics in London. “So there’s been a very strong pick up in China’s demand for metals.” That’s good news not only for metals markets, but could also herald better times for the global economy. Analysts have studied the prices of some metals as a leading indicator of global economic growth. “People’s perception of the economy is how weakened it is, yet all the industrial metals are telling you a very different story,” said Chris Verrone, an analyst and partner at Strategas Research in New York. “We think copper is the market trying to tell us that the economy is stronger than we expect.” — Matt Phillips Mnuchin and Pelosi inch toward resuming stimulus talks as economy continues to struggle. Top Democrats on Thursday were crafting a $2.4 trillion package — about $1 trillion less than the measure the House approved in May — that could either serve as a new basis for the Democratic position in negotiations or be voted on as a stand-alone package in the coming days, according to a senior Democratic aide. A rise in new claims for state jobless benefits signals continuing layoffs. About 825,000 Americans filed for state unemployment benefits last week. That is up from 796,000 a week earlier, though it is far below the more than six million people a week who were filing for benefits during the peak period of layoffs in the spring. By any measure, however, hundreds of thousands of Americans are losing their jobs each week, and millions more laid off earlier in the crisis are still relying on unemployed benefits to meet their basic expenses. Applications for benefits remain higher than at the peak of many past recessions, and after falling quickly in the spring, the number has declined only slowly in recent weeks. Tech stocks dragged stocks to their fifth decline in the last six sessions. Stocks have been retreating since that Sept. 2 peak, as investors rotated out of the high-flying tech shares and concerns grew about the state of the economy. A key worry has been Washington’s inability to reach a deal on a new economic aid package, and the gridlock between Democrats and Republicans has only worsened since the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last week. Disney delays the release of ‘Black Widow,’ ‘West Side Story’ and other films. Movie theaters, already starved for new Hollywood films to show, were handed new setbacks on Wednesday: Walt Disney Studios said it would hold off releasing several major films, including “Black Widow,” a Marvel superhero spectacle, and Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story.” Britain issues a U-turn for office workers, urging them to stay home. Companies that had been under pressure from British government ministers to get employees back to the office were scrambling to change their guidance for staff. Some had organized rotation systems to alternate different teams in the office to ensure social distancing. Others supplied personal protective equipment, created one-way systems to move around offices and reconfigured desk spaces. Both JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs were at about 30 percent capacity in their London offices. Wall Street climbs, snapping a losing streak as tech rallies The S&P 500 rose more than 1 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed nearly 2 percent. Amazon and Twitter gained more than 6 percent to become the best performing stock in the S&P 500. President Trump says China must cede control of TikTok or he ‘won’t make the deal.’ Asked about reports that TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, would still own 80 percent of the service after the deal, President Trump said that they would “have nothing to do with it, and if they do we just won’t make the deal.” He said Oracle and Walmart, which under the deal would take a 20 percent stake in the new company, TikTok Global, would control the service. Wall Street continues slide as virus cases rise and Washington gridlock worsens. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
