And I’m Ross Douthat, and this is “The Argument.” Today, the argument turns two, and our special guest is you. Hi friends at “The Argument.” I’m calling because I have a question I want to hear you debate. Hi, this is a message for Michelle. Hi, my question is for Ross. And I very much enjoy your show. I just listened to the most recent episode. Hey, my name is Tina. I’m from Denver, Colorado. Hey, this is Liam in Philadelphia. This is Eric from Fair Oaks, California. We answer your questions about the upcoming election and everything else under the sun. But first, would Democrats be justified in packing the Supreme Court? Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation hearing began this week. But instead of parsing the back and forth of the hearings, we’re going to jump ahead and talk about what might happen after her confirmation and the November vote and whether three decades of partisan warfare will culminate in a Democratic Senate majority trying to pack — or if you prefer, add justices to rebalance — the Supreme Court. Joe Biden, rather conspicuously, is declining to take a position on court packing, but we don’t have Joe Biden’s problems here on “The Argument.” So I thought we could start with Michelle making the case. You’re a Democratic senator. It’s early 2021. What’s the argument that you make to the American people for why it’s reasonable to rebalance the Supreme Court? Well, I’m actually not sure you make that argument in early 2021. So of course, I feel like Democrats are entirely justified in redressing this and not letting the court be just like a reactionary check on any attempt at Democratic policymaking, dooming a Joe Biden administration to failure. That said, I don’t think it should be the first thing Biden does or that Democrats do. I think it should be an option that they hold in reserve, in case you start seeing a court that strikes down massive parts of the Voting Rights Act, in case you see a court that strikes down Roe v. Wade or that strikes down the Affordable Care Act or that really, really interferes with Biden’s efforts to pull the country out of the flaming wreckage that Trump has left it in. And then the argument is, I’m not comfortable with packing the court, blah, blah, blah. I believe in all these norms. Are we really going to let Donald Trump’s justices stop us from ending the Trump recession, or from ending the Trump depression? And I think that that will be a more palatable argument, again, if the Supreme Court keeps striking down kind of common-sense Biden legislation. So let’s just take a quick detour. Why do you think Joe Biden isn’t saying that? He had previously said he wasn’t in favor of court packing, but now he’s basically saying, oh, I’m not going to play that game. You’ll know my answer after the election, all of these kinds of things. Why doesn’t he just say something like, I’m not for court packing. The Supreme Court needs to respect democracy or respect the will of the people or something like that? I think he should. I think maybe the reason — and I don’t know if this is true — is that they are afraid that that would be spun as kind of extortion. I think part of his kind of hesitance, part of his refusal to say I’m not for court packing is that they sort of want to send a message maybe to John Roberts that the court’s legitimacy really is on the line. And so yeah, I wish he would say that in my personal language. Then again, I also feel like the Joe Biden campaign has consistently proven itself smarter than all of the pundits that like to give it advice. So even though it seems to me like an unforced error, I mean, it’s definitely not a good idea to say the people deserve an answer to this, but I sort of understand the reticence to kind of submit to demands that they answer this question. Right. We did a segment before on this issue where we had our colleague Jamelle Bouie on, where we talked about various big-picture reforms for the Supreme Court. And so all the listeners who remember that segment remember that I’m not personally someone who thinks that the structure of the Supreme Court is set in stone. And I said in print that I think Republicans can be willing to risk court packing as a scenario if they nominate Barrett, and that’s just sort of part of Democratic politics. And that’s OK. So I’m not going to make a case against court packing that’s a sort of it’s the end of the Republic kind of argument. But I would make sort of two points from a kind of Republican perspective, and the second one, I think, you somewhat agree with, actually, based on your plan for when to pack the court, if it becomes necessary. But I think the first point from the Republican perspective is that if Democrats want to be in favor of taking this step, that’s fine. Well, that’s not the Republican perspective. That’s not the Republican perspective, but that’s my perspective. You need to acknowledge that this is just a continuing escalation, that, in fact, whatever Democrats’ objections to how Republicans handled Merrick Garland nomination and how they’ve handled this nomination, those actions are within the sort of basic president’s nominate, Senate confirms or rejects system that has been the system for basically 150 years. You have to go back to the middle of the 19th century for a real change in the structure of the court. And so what we’ve had since the 1980s is a sort of escalating tit-for-tat. But I think Democrats are in a certain amount of willful denial about how big a step, how big an escalation court packing would be, relative to the Barrett nomination or turning down Garland. But it’s not just the Barrett nomination, right? It’s the entire Federal Judiciary. So maybe they should start with packing some of these lower courts, where nobody is going to get upset about expanding the size of the D.C. circuit or the 5th circuit or the 7th circuit. But I also think it’s important to note that when Republicans thought Hillary Clinton was going to be the next president, they were all for changing the size of the Supreme Court, either explicitly or sort of tacitly, right? You had in the National Review, they were saying, let’s shrink the court to six justices, and that it’s totally appropriate to change the size of the court in response to executive appointments. And then there was other people who were less explicit but just sort of wanted to change the size of the court to eight or seven judges in practice. You had a number of Republicans saying, we are not going to confirm any of Hillary Clinton’s judicial nominees. And in fact, an eight-person court is historically just fine. So you had one piece in the National Review. You had John McCain saying something like that. I think you had Ted Cruz saying something like that. And Richard Burr. I mean, one, had the Republicans done that, had they refused to confirm any justices or refused to give a vote to a Hillary Clinton nominee at any point in her four-year term in office, that would have been a much bigger escalation than the Garland escalation. And I agree. But one, that didn’t happen, so we don’t know if that would have happened. Two, I think cobbling together things a few G.O.P. senators said in one op-ed doesn’t prove at all that — Well, there was more than that. I mean, there was also the Cato Institute, The Federalist. It was a whole thing. Right, it was a whole thing — It was G.O.P. conventional wisdom. No, see, I don’t think it was G.O.P. conventional wisdom. I think if it’s an op-ed National Review and The Federalist and three senators — And three leading senators. — three leading senators in an election year, I don’t think amounts to a G.O.P. consensus. And I think Republicans would have run into the same big political difficulties doing that that I suspect Democrats will run into if they try and add justices. It would have been extremely unpopular, and it would have given Hillary Clinton a pretty big issue to sort of whack at them with. But here’s the other thing about popularity and unpopularity. I mean, I feel like one of the lessons of the Trump years has actually been that most voters don’t care about process stuff and kind of legitimacy stuff and kind of the intricacies of Democratic governance, right? What they care about is economic results. And I think that you could easily reach a point where those two things are in conflict, where the Supreme Court starts basically making it impossible for Joe Biden to govern, to have a successful term, to again, undo the wreckage that Trump has left the country with. And in that case, whatever the short-term hit you take from changing the size of the court, I think is much smaller than the hit you take from being unable to fix the economy. So I think that might be right. But before we get to that, could I get you to concede that court packing would be a significant escalation? I don’t know if you can because I feel like if you just take it in terms of, is it a significant escalation if you’re just limiting the frame to Merrick Garland and R.B.G. and the kind of broken promises around that seat? Yes. If you look at it in terms of the entire remaking of the Judiciary and actually just kind of four years of Republicans telling us, we’re going to do it because we can and you try to stop us, four years of just being punched in the face by people who don’t — But wait a minute, look, appointing — I mean, the stuff Trump has done with the Federal Judiciary is the least norm-busting stuff he has done anywhere, right? But I’m saying, you put the Federal Judiciary in the context of installing you know all of these kind of acting lackeys throughout the government, of frankly, demanding that your attorney general arrest your opponent, right? It’s just after four years of this stuff, when Republicans say — He hasn’t. He hasn’t, by the way. You don’t get credit for that. You’re not going to give Bill Barr any credit? [MICHELLE LAUGHS] Come on. He’s standing athwart tyranny, Michelle. [LAUGHING] Bill Barr is saving the Republic right now, as we speak, and you won’t give him credit? So after four years of what they have done to us, I think so many Democrats have been radicalized that when Republicans say, how dare you break these unwritten rules of civic governance, I mean, you just want to laugh. It feels almost abusive. Right, this is how escalation works, right? It’s that both sides convince themselves that the set of wrong is that the other side has committed justify whatever the next step is. I understand, but this is why this kind of both-sides stuff drives Democrats wild because there really is — But with the courts, it is both sides. It’s literally sort of boringly predictable. Democrats start rejecting Supreme Court nominees on ideological grounds. Then you go to the filibuster, then you go to the abusive blue slips. You know, Harry Reid does one thing. Mitch McConnell does another thing. It literally is tit-for-tat. Now, I agree that to make the case that Republicans have escalated in these ways, you have to bring in stuff outside the judicial wars. But within the context of the judicial wars, it’s just all predictable. I don’t think you could have imagined Democrats saying that they just will not let a Republican president fill any judicial seats for years on end, which is what led us up to both scrapping the filibuster — But wait a minute, Republicans didn’t do that. What Republicans did was not confirm Merrick Garland in a six-month window, which was — No, they kind of sneer and be like, Obama left all these seats open. Obama didn’t leave those seats open. They used unprecedented procedural maneuvers to refuse to let Obama fill the Federal Judiciary. When Obama tried to fill the Federal Judiciary, in a normal process, Republicans called it court packing, right? Tom Cotton had a Stop Court Packing Act, which was meant to shrink the size of the D.C. circuit so that there would be less judges for Obama to appoint. Well, first of all, it’s not entirely true. Obama very clearly did not prioritize judicial nominations to the extent Trump did, or you would have had more confirmations in that window. He just didn’t. Second, the reason the Democrats got rid of the judicial filibuster was that they, themselves, had been the ones using it, and the Republican resistance to Obama’s judges was a response to escalation under Bush that was temporarily diffused by the gang-of-whatever deal in the mid-2000s. There’s just a long list of escalating wrongs. And let’s pivot to the second question because I think there, I think you’re absolutely right, that the Democrats — Let’s just end it there. — can’t pack the court. Yeah, you’re right, Michelle. [MICHELLE LAUGHS] I concede everything. I’m going to go march to Bill Barr’s office and make a citizen’s arrest after this podcast. I don’t think there’s any way or any likely way that the Democrats would move to add justices just right out of the gate. I think politically, you need some sort of outrage to cite from a Barrett-Roberts-Kavanaugh Supreme Court. Here, I think the question that sort of hovers over a Democratic outrage — kind of seems like the Supreme Court, with all these Republican nominees, has not been in the business of generating those kind of outrages. I think there’s this assumption among Democrats that, well, if you put these Trump justices in, you are, as you always say, locking in minority rule, making it impossible for Democrats to govern, and so on. But the pattern of all these Republican judicial appointees has been, one, surprising or not that surprising shifts to the left on the social issues that lots of Democrats really care about, joined to a great deal of caution around anything that smacks of 1920s or 1930s-style or even 1890s-style striking down economic legislation, right? So I think that’s bananas because I think that some of the most important decisions are Citizens United, the gutting of voting rights law, the kind of fruits of which we’re seeing play out all over the country and which may, in fact, end up being what gives Trump a second term, despite the manifest wishes of the majority of the American people. I think voting rights and Citizens United are the two biggest examples of sort of activism from the court on the right. The Citizens United decision was correct, and the Voting Rights decision was just sort of John Roberts making policy. But I don’t think either of those cases are examples of blocking sweeping economic legislation. And I mean, I think Roberts did a lot of policy-making that was foolish in his Obamacare ruling. And in hindsight, he would have been better off ruling the mandate unconstitutional and then severing the rest of the law from it because it turns out, the mandate wasn’t that big a deal. But regardless, Obamacare was not overturned. I think there’s no way that the current Obamacare challenge is going to result in the law being overturned. And yes, it is sort of nonsense that the Trump administration is simultaneously pushing it while sort of denying that they’re pushing it. But still, it’s not going to be overturned. And I think Roberts — if you look at the polling on the Supreme Court, Roberts has actually been a really effective politician. The Supreme Court’s approval ratings have dipped a bit, but it’s still the most well-respected branch of government. And Amy Coney Barrett, I’m looking at the Morning Consult poll right now, pending whatever else happens in her confirmation hearing, she has a strong plurality supporting her nomination. I think that’s a case study in how Roberts’s caution has made, I think, a lot of middle-of-the-road Americans feel like it’s not a threat to democracy if Republican jurists are on the Supreme Court. So again, given Roberts’s kind of unremitting hostility to voting rights, and I think there’s a tension between his status as a G.O.P. apparatchik, his unremitting hostility to voting rights and limits on corporate power, and his desire to preserve the court’s legitimacy and to sort of not want to be the fifth vote in a lot of extremely unpopular rulings, I think that changes if Amy Coney Barrett is the fifth vote in those rulings, right? Or if some of those rulings can be 6-3 instead of 5-4. Well, actually, I want to ask you a question. Can I ask you a question? Yeah, you can. So I’m kind of assuming that Roe v. Wade is gone and then you’ll have a bunch of state laws either criminalizing abortion or protecting it. Where does then the pro-life movement stop? I mean, my guess is that the pro-life movement doesn’t say like, OK, now we’re happy. My guess is that they then try to say that actually, the fetal life is constitutionally protected. Before, they wanted some sort of life amendment to the Constitution. It seems like you could get there in other ways. My guess is that Biden would try to pass some sort of national pro-choice legislation. Do you see the Supreme Court then striking that down, and do you see them striking down any state-level pro-choice laws? I guess my answer to the second question relates to my answer to the first question. I don’t think that this court would overturn Roe v. Wade in the way that I think would be constitutionally correct. I have a lot of skepticism that Kavanaugh and Roberts especially would. You’d need at least one of them to get that kind of ruling. What is it about Kavanaugh’s record that makes you skeptical that he would be all in for that? I mean, I don’t think, per se, it’s his record so much as sort of what he represents. He represents a very institutionalist, Chevy Chase part of the conservative legal movement. I have a very political conception of this. I don’t think analyzing his views on precedent exactly is the right way to think about this. I think he, probably like Roberts, cares about how the court is seen and understood in the greater D.C. area, and I think he would see plenty of space to sort of create more room for states to regulate second-trimester abortions where you could do that and say we’ve chipped away at Roe without ending Roe entirely. I could be totally wrong. That’s just my sense and speculation. We’ll be right back to take a lot of your questions. And we’re back. So for a while, we’ve been asking you to send us your questions, election related and otherwise, and you certainly have a lot of them. So now, let’s hear from you. Hi, my name is Max Greenberg. My question is if Trump appoints and confirms, by the Senate, a Supreme Court nominee before election day, what is the incentive of the Republicans to vote for him if they’re disillusioned with him anyway? Hypothetically, if they get what they want, they got that last open seat appointed by a conservative president, why wouldn’t they perhaps vote for someone else? Thank you. So that’s a really good question, Max. When Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away and her seat became vacant, there were a couple of people, I think Sean Trende, the election analyst for RealClearPolitics and some others, who said the really strategic and Machiavellian thing for Trump to do here would be to make some sort of show of magnanimity and say, I’m not going to appoint someone because I’m so sure I’m going to win and then use that to basically boost his own turnout, to sort of raise the stakes in the elections for religious conservatives, especially. And obviously, he hasn’t done that. But from my perspective, I think if you’re a Republican, if you’re especially a conservative concerned about the courts who sort of gambled on Trump last time for the sake of Supreme Court nominations, there’s a totally reasonable argument that you should sort of pocket your gains, basically say, yeah, we got three Supreme Court seats, one global pandemic, and it’s time to walk away from the table and either not vote or vote for someone else and sort of declare victory in the Trump bet. That being said, I think there were a lot of Trump voters, sort of wary Trump voters in 2016, who if you had told them you’ll get three Supreme Court seats out of this administration and then you’ll have a chance to vote a moderate Democrat in, and they would have said, at that point, oh, maybe I’ll do that. But in fact, the way partisanship and negative polarization works, those same people are now obsessed with the idea that you have to keep defeating the Democrats no matter what. I also don’t think that they are disillusioned. A couple of them are disillusioned, but I think most of them are thrilled. And the only thing that makes them unhappy about Trump is that he seems to be doing badly and might let Biden get elected and let Democrats take the Senate. So you’re not going to vote for Biden because you’re angry about that scenario. I remember talking to particularly women on the religious right in 2016, when they were very, very skeptical of Trump, thinking that there might be more kind of religious right abstention than there ultimately was. But what they were skeptical of is that they didn’t trust him to give them everything they wanted, right? They knew, I think, that he obviously doesn’t personally care about abortion and that it would actually be more popular, when he got into office, to move to the center on social issues. And so that’s what they expected and feared that he would do. And then he didn’t do that. And so I think they are, by and large, delighted. I mean, delighted is maybe not strong enough a word for how they feel about his presidency. So I mean, yeah, I think you’re describing a real phenomenon. And this isn’t just true for religious conservatives. I think there’s a broad group of movement conservatives who had that kind of skepticism, ended up being really happy that Trump sort of governed as a more conventional conservative and so are more enthusiastic about voting for him. At the same time, there is also a kind of squishily pro-life evangelical or Catholic swing vote, too. And the inroads that Democrats have made in the sunbelt and in the suburbs and so on depends, in part, on some women, many of them religious women, who voted for Trump last time and aren’t voting for him this time. So different groups have different trajectories, and there is some swing vote that would have fallen into the sort of churchgoing, suburbanite Republican category four, especially eight years ago. Don’t you think? Sure. There’s some of them. It’s interesting. Last night, I sat in on an online focus group of women who voted for Trump in 2016 and are now unhappy with his performance and trying to decide who to vote for. And not one of them wanted Roe v. Wade to be overturned. Some of them identified as pro-life, actually. Not one of them wanted Roe v. Wade to be overturned. So maybe that counts is squishily pro-life. I count it as squishily pro-life. Not one of them was excited about the Amy Coney Barrett nomination. And so you know, whatever, that’s just like a small snapshot. One of an endless multitude of terrible things about this election is that it’s hard to report on the way I would have reported on elections in the past. So I’m just not talking to people the way I would have been out talking to people in the past. But I do think that the people who care the most about the Supreme Court are the people who are the happiest about the Donald Trump presidency. This is from listener Carolyn. She writes, no doubt, you followed the recent interviews with Stuart Stevens, the former Republican consultant who managed lots of high-level political marketing campaigns. The argument to be had, I think, looking into his latest book, “It Was All A Lie,” is whether the thesis is true. Was the outreach to minorities and women by Republican candidates during the Nixon years and then later in the autopsy after the 2012 Romney defeat simply a ruse until the rise of Trump and Trumpism, which allowed Republicans — traditional and newly disaffected voters to unleash their racist and misogynistic ids? I think it’s basically true. I guess where I would differ is that when Reince Priebus commissioned the autopsy after 2012, I don’t think it was sort of him rubbing his hands and thinking, this is how we’re going to cover our tracks until we get to go full white nationalist. I think they sort of thought that this is the way forward for a Republican Party that is going to carry forward the kind of foreign policy and economic agenda. There’s always been this divide between the consultant class and some of the leaders of the Republican Party and a lot of the base of the Republican Party, right? You had a lot of voters who were sort of in it for the racism and a lot of donors and consultants who were in it for laissez-faire capitalism. What I think the Trump years have done is just revealed the depth of that divide, revealed how little the average Republican voter, including people who went to Tea Party protests, ostensibly about small government, ever cared about any of that. Really, the thing that motivated them was racial and gender grievance. Look, some of these consultants, even though I’m so glad that they are joining the side of good against evil now, they obviously understood that those sentiments were there because they made ads for many, many years playing on them. But maybe they didn’t realize the extent to which they were really what was driving things. From now on, I think all the people who were uncomfortable with being a blatantly white nationalist party of patriarchal restoration, those people are gone. And so that’s what the Republican Party is going to be for the foreseeable future. So I have, like, 17 hours worth of thoughts [MICHELLE LAUGHS] about both Stuart Stevens and the Lincoln Project, which is the larger group of Republican consultants taking amazing amounts of liberal money to cut ads against Trump. I won’t go on for 17 hours. But my quick view is, one, a much more limited version of Michelle’s argument. I think that it’s perfectly clear from the Trump era that white identity politics and sort of racial resentment are a bigger part of what counts as right-of-center politics in America than a lot of Republicans wanted to admit five or 10 years ago. And to the extent that people like Stevens are just sort of saying that, saying, we didn’t recognize this part of our party. And now it’s sort of come to the surface, and we’re going to condemn it. I think that’s good, and they should do that. But I also think that the reason that things like white identity politics get activated and become important is often a result of sort of establishment failure, that you can’t understand Trump if you don’t understand how we went from George W. Bush, a president who was trying to do a lot of racial outreach and trying to change the Republican Party’s sort of party-of-whiteness situation, we went from there to here because George W. Bush presided over a disastrous foreign war and then we had a massive recession that was not entirely Bush’s fault but wasn’t entirely not his fault either. And people like Stevens and a lot of the consultants and establishment Republicans who have sort of taken on this role, I don’t see a lot of soul searching and self-scrutiny from them about how that past created this present, how the weaknesses of the Romney campaign, which Stevens himself ran, created this present, right? I think that there needs to be more self-scrutiny from the Republican establishment about what kind of choices lead to a situation where Trumpian populism bubbles up for the next hypothetical time when they or someone like them gets to run Republican campaigns again. So next, let’s take an email from reader Jonathan who writes from our neighbor to the north, from Toronto, Canada. Speaking of your point about undecided voters before, Michelle, he wants to know, how could anyone be undecided in the 2020 election? [LAUGHS] He says, what could possibly happen that could shift a voter in one direction or the other at this point? I firmly believe that anyone not stampeding for the ballot box is waiting for an excuse to vote for Trump that they can use to live with themselves. This is incomprehensible to me. Can you dig into that a bit? So I think that you are right that the people who are undecided at this point are sort of undecided conservatives, right? I think if you are a liberal, if you lean left, you’ve already made up your mind. And so as I said before, I recently was able to look in on this online focus group of women who voted for Trump in swing states, who are very disaffected with his performance and were kind of talking about what they’re going to do in 2020. Most of them are genuinely undecided. And it was a very sobering thing to watch because it’s not that they sort of have strong policy views pushing them one way or the other. It was more just that they sort of seemed to swim in a sea of disinformation and mistrust. What they kept saying over and over again was things like, I don’t know what to believe, I don’t know what’s true anymore. There was one woman who was undecided but was saying, I just wish Obama could come back, right? Which if you’re thinking ideologically, it’s sort of breathtaking that you could wish you could vote for Barack Obama but be undecided if you’re going to vote for Joe Biden. But they didn’t like Trump. They thought he was a bully. Their own lives had become markedly worse. Some of them were out of work because of the pandemic. They had kids home because of the pandemic. They think Trump is embarrassing. But one woman, for example, said that she blamed Trump for the shutdowns, which she didn’t like, was afraid that Biden was also going to shut down the country, which is something that she got from a Trump ad. And so again, I think that for a long time, American politics sort of venerated swing voters as if they were the most judicious voters, as if they were the people who were really not swayed by partisan biases but were really kind of carefully weighing the evidence for and against the two candidates. But in fact, swing voters are the people who pay the least attention to politics. A lot of these women said that they couldn’t watch the news because it was so negative. And so what will change their minds, I guess, will be something that shapes sort of their ephemeral impression closer to election day. And some of them, they were genuinely horrified by Trump’s refusal to condemn white supremacy at the debate. So if there’s something that happens closer to election day that reactivates that, it could push them in one direction. At the same time, they believed a lot of what Trump says about Biden’s senility. Some of them thought that Biden is just a front for Kamala Harris, who at least one of them really distrusted. I know I quote Hannah Arendt way too much, but I’m going to do once again. She wrote in “The Origins of Totalitarianism,” the ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced communist but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction, i.e. the reality of experience and the distinction between true and false, i.e. the standards of thought, no longer exists. So I guess let me say something on behalf of undecided voters. I especially agree that there are just lots of people in America who do not pay close attention to politics at all and who approach elections the way casual football fans approach deciding who to root for in the Super Bowl. And in a democracy of 300 million people, I think the existence of that attitude is both an inevitable thing and not always a bad thing. I guess I disagree a little bit with the Arendt quote. If you’re that voter, you’re probably focused on your own material reality. And so you look at your material reality, and let’s say you’re a working-class American. The first three years of the Trump era were for reasons that may have nothing to do with Trump himself economically better for you than the last four years of the Obama administration then Covid came along and you’re in worse shape but maybe like the voter Michelle cited. You’re worried, well, the shutdowns hit you really hard, and the Democrats seem more pro-shutdown in certain ways than the Republicans. So you’re worried about that. That’s not an unreasonable chain of inferences to make someone undecided. It doesn’t rely just on misinformation or some kind of miasma. So that’s an attempt to partially justify the late-deciding, undecided voter. All right, let’s turn slightly away from politics for our last question. Hi, my name is Olivia Grayson. I’m calling from Philadelphia. And this is a little out there, but I would like to hear you guys discuss a song that is making waves all over the world via the internet. It has a music video that’s gone viral. It’s called WAP, W-A-P. I’ll let you Google it and see what that stands for. [MUSIC - CARDI B AND MEGAN THEE STALLION, “WAP”] I don’t cook. I don’t clean. But let me tell you, I got this ring. Gobble me. Swallow me. ^VOICEMAIL^ It’s by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion. And it’s caused some arguments between my boyfriend and I. I personally feel really sick of people telling me that language like this is empowering. And he’s like, who are you to judge? I would like the hosts to talk about how this song fits into the conversation about feminism and whether that is where feminism is right now. Is this a feminist anthem? So I have very mixed feelings about this. I’m going to be the last person to criticize Cardi B or Megan Thee Stallion or to say that what they find empowering, what a lot of listeners find empowering is not, in fact, empowering. Clearly, it’s empowering for them. Clearly, they has been able to own their own sexuality and exploit it on their own behalf instead of letting others exploit them. Many, many of their fans find that thrilling and emboldening and enriching, and I would never say a word against that. I would say a word against your boyfriend [LAUGHING] telling you that you should find something empowering if you don’t. And to me, that’s the sort of double-edged sword of what’s sometimes called sex-positive feminism, is that it’s great for the people who really do feel liberated by it. And it is not great for the women who feel coerced by it on behalf of feminism, who feel like if they were real feminists, they wouldn’t be as reserved or prudish or whatever. I mean, this was something I felt a ton in my own life, particularly when I was younger. I spent a big part of my 20s in San Francisco in the ‘90s, in the age of feminist strip clubs. And I remember having an extremely high-profile sex-positive feminist really shame me for thinking that I was going to have a monogamous relationship with my then boyfriend, who’s now my husband. I remember being really, really embarrassed and self-conscious about my own self-consciousness, about being naked at Burning Man in public. And my then boyfriend, now husband, actually built me a shower stall so that I didn’t have to take a shower in front of everyone. And so again, I think that there can be something genuinely liberatory for people who felt their sexuality being constrained and controlled. And it can also, I think, feel to a lot of women like a new set of commands and obligations. I’m not sure I have that much to add to that [LAUGHS] except two things. One is that it’s sort of astonishing to think about how we’ve gone from the culture of the same period that Michelle is describing— Michelle is describing the sort of world of sex-positive feminism in late-1990s San Francisco. I think the complete victory of sex-positive feminism since then is kind of striking in that if you went back to the mid-1990s and you had a song like this online and on the airwaves, you would have a really strong contingent of sort of centrist and left-of-center scolds in the Tipper Gore school. And I’m not using scolds — obviously, I’m in favor of scolds. No, Ross is — [LAUGHING] I’m scold positive. That’s high praise. High praise, right. So there was this kind of moralistic, Tipper-Gore-style thing that was a big part of American culture. And that has gone away to the point where the people making the is-this-really-empowerment case are people like Ben Shapiro, who are immediately attacked and mocked and so on roundly. So that’s a big shift. I’m not going to try to get into the heart of Tipper Gore, but part of the political reason for Democrats to make that case, it’s sort of an outgrowth of the sort of Sister Souljah move. They didn’t want to let social conservatives completely outflank them on the right, right? Because the idea that there was this broader social anxiety about a lot of this stuff. That’s true, but I think Tipper believed it. And that has disappeared. Obviously, it has disappeared when you have a president who appeared in soft-core porn films, who paid off a porn star, who is just by far the most depraved and licentious character ever to occupy the presidency, when the religious right has so debased itself, when you have Jerry Falwell Jr. revealed as a— [LAUGHING] Cuck. —alleged, I guess I should say— Cuck is the term. Right. [LAUGHING] Alleged cuck. There is no longer any sort of legitimate right-wing moralism that — Except on this podcast. Come on. [LAUGHING] But nobody on the left feels like they have to prove to the right that they’re not really all sort of depraved San Franciscans. They just don’t because any sort of right-wing credibility on this has so completely collapsed. All right, we need to leave things there. Thank you to everyone who called in or wrote in. And we’ll try to do more questions after the election. And now, let’s do our recommendation. And it’s my turn this week. And I’m going to recommend HBO’s documentary The Vow — Oh my god, I just started watching it. It’s so good. — which is a show about, speaking of sex, what often gets described as a sex cult— Nxivm, this fascinating mix of life-coaching and multi-level marketing and the branding. Like, the literal branding. The literal branding. Like, the branding of flesh. The branding of flesh with the initials of a guy named Keith Raniere, who was, since this cult has been sort of busted up in various ways, the founder and guru. You know, I hesitated to watch it for a while because I sort of thought I knew this story already, right? It’s been pretty extensively reported on. And I really, really did not know this story. I had no idea how huge particularly the multi-level marketing part of this thing was, and it sort of explains how there’s this huge realization and then there’s this smaller group within it, this smaller group of women that are branded and sort of are pledged to Keith Raniere. And they basically have to make themselves blackmailable in order to join the group. They give up some collateral — Collateral, right. — something that would either embarrass you or somehow sort of wreck your life if it was exposed. So that’s how they ensure that they can trust you and that you’ll comply. Well, I mean, I think one thing that’s interesting too is if you don’t know where it’s going, which some people coming to it won’t, although we’ve just sort of given it away, or if you just know generally this is a cult or something, you can watch the first episode and be like, well, maybe some small part of this got out of hand. But in the bigger picture, this seems like a very normal American sort of self-help program. And it’s sort of interesting that it accidentally ended up with some cultish element close to the center. And it’s only over the subsequent episodes that it becomes clear sort of the extent to which the sort of cultish aspect was more sort of central in there all along. So one more time, I recommend that everybody watch HBO’s documentary The Vow. And that’s our show this week. Thank you so much for listening.

Special thanks to Corey Schreppel. See you next Friday. [BLOOPER] But it doesn’t apply to things like wa— oh sorry, so it’s WAP, WAP, WA— TRANSCRIPT I’m Michelle Goldberg. And I’m Ross Douthat, and this is “The Argument.” Today, the argument turns two, and our special guest is you. Hi friends at “The Argument.” I’m calling because I have a question I want to hear you debate. Hi, this is a message for Michelle. Hi, my question is for Ross. And I very much enjoy your show. I just listened to the most recent episode. Hey, my name is Tina. I’m from Denver, Colorado. Hey, this is Liam in Philadelphia. This is Eric from Fair Oaks, California. We answer your questions about the upcoming election and everything else under the sun. But first, would Democrats be justified in packing the Supreme Court? Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation hearing began this week. But instead of parsing the back and forth of the hearings, we’re going to jump ahead and talk about what might happen after her confirmation and the November vote and whether three decades of partisan warfare will culminate in a Democratic Senate majority trying to pack — or if you prefer, add justices to rebalance — the Supreme Court. Joe Biden, rather conspicuously, is declining to take a position on court packing, but we don’t have Joe Biden’s problems here on “The Argument.” So I thought we could start with Michelle making the case. You’re a Democratic senator. It’s early 2021. What’s the argument that you make to the American people for why it’s reasonable to rebalance the Supreme Court? Well, I’m actually not sure you make that argument in early 2021. So of course, I feel like Democrats are entirely justified in redressing this and not letting the court be just like a reactionary check on any attempt at Democratic policymaking, dooming a Joe Biden administration to failure. That said, I don’t think it should be the first thing Biden does or that Democrats do. I think it should be an option that they hold in reserve, in case you start seeing a court that strikes down massive parts of the Voting Rights Act, in case you see a court that strikes down Roe v. Wade or that strikes down the Affordable Care Act or that really, really interferes with Biden’s efforts to pull the country out of the flaming wreckage that Trump has left it in. And then the argument is, I’m not comfortable with packing the court, blah, blah, blah. I believe in all these norms. Are we really going to let Donald Trump’s justices stop us from ending the Trump recession, or from ending the Trump depression? And I think that that will be a more palatable argument, again, if the Supreme Court keeps striking down kind of common-sense Biden legislation. So let’s just take a quick detour. Why do you think Joe Biden isn’t saying that? He had previously said he wasn’t in favor of court packing, but now he’s basically saying, oh, I’m not going to play that game. You’ll know my answer after the election, all of these kinds of things. Why doesn’t he just say something like, I’m not for court packing. The Supreme Court needs to respect democracy or respect the will of the people or something like that? I think he should. I think maybe the reason — and I don’t know if this is true — is that they are afraid that that would be spun as kind of extortion. I think part of his kind of hesitance, part of his refusal to say I’m not for court packing is that they sort of want to send a message maybe to John Roberts that the court’s legitimacy really is on the line. And so yeah, I wish he would say that in my personal language. Then again, I also feel like the Joe Biden campaign has consistently proven itself smarter than all of the pundits that like to give it advice. So even though it seems to me like an unforced error, I mean, it’s definitely not a good idea to say the people deserve an answer to this, but I sort of understand the reticence to kind of submit to demands that they answer this question. Right. We did a segment before on this issue where we had our colleague Jamelle Bouie on, where we talked about various big-picture reforms for the Supreme Court. And so all the listeners who remember that segment remember that I’m not personally someone who thinks that the structure of the Supreme Court is set in stone. And I said in print that I think Republicans can be willing to risk court packing as a scenario if they nominate Barrett, and that’s just sort of part of Democratic politics. And that’s OK. So I’m not going to make a case against court packing that’s a sort of it’s the end of the Republic kind of argument. But I would make sort of two points from a kind of Republican perspective, and the second one, I think, you somewhat agree with, actually, based on your plan for when to pack the court, if it becomes necessary. But I think the first point from the Republican perspective is that if Democrats want to be in favor of taking this step, that’s fine. Well, that’s not the Republican perspective. That’s not the Republican perspective, but that’s my perspective. You need to acknowledge that this is just a continuing escalation, that, in fact, whatever Democrats’ objections to how Republicans handled Merrick Garland nomination and how they’ve handled this nomination, those actions are within the sort of basic president’s nominate, Senate confirms or rejects system that has been the system for basically 150 years. You have to go back to the middle of the 19th century for a real change in the structure of the court. And so what we’ve had since the 1980s is a sort of escalating tit-for-tat. But I think Democrats are in a certain amount of willful denial about how big a step, how big an escalation court packing would be, relative to the Barrett nomination or turning down Garland. But it’s not just the Barrett nomination, right? It’s the entire Federal Judiciary. So maybe they should start with packing some of these lower courts, where nobody is going to get upset about expanding the size of the D.C. circuit or the 5th circuit or the 7th circuit. But I also think it’s important to note that when Republicans thought Hillary Clinton was going to be the next president, they were all for changing the size of the Supreme Court, either explicitly or sort of tacitly, right? You had in the National Review, they were saying, let’s shrink the court to six justices, and that it’s totally appropriate to change the size of the court in response to executive appointments. And then there was other people who were less explicit but just sort of wanted to change the size of the court to eight or seven judges in practice. You had a number of Republicans saying, we are not going to confirm any of Hillary Clinton’s judicial nominees. And in fact, an eight-person court is historically just fine. So you had one piece in the National Review. You had John McCain saying something like that. I think you had Ted Cruz saying something like that. And Richard Burr. I mean, one, had the Republicans done that, had they refused to confirm any justices or refused to give a vote to a Hillary Clinton nominee at any point in her four-year term in office, that would have been a much bigger escalation than the Garland escalation. And I agree. But one, that didn’t happen, so we don’t know if that would have happened. Two, I think cobbling together things a few G.O.P. senators said in one op-ed doesn’t prove at all that — Well, there was more than that. I mean, there was also the Cato Institute, The Federalist. It was a whole thing. Right, it was a whole thing — It was G.O.P. conventional wisdom. No, see, I don’t think it was G.O.P. conventional wisdom. I think if it’s an op-ed National Review and The Federalist and three senators — And three leading senators. — three leading senators in an election year, I don’t think amounts to a G.O.P. consensus. And I think Republicans would have run into the same big political difficulties doing that that I suspect Democrats will run into if they try and add justices. It would have been extremely unpopular, and it would have given Hillary Clinton a pretty big issue to sort of whack at them with. But here’s the other thing about popularity and unpopularity. I mean, I feel like one of the lessons of the Trump years has actually been that most voters don’t care about process stuff and kind of legitimacy stuff and kind of the intricacies of Democratic governance, right? What they care about is economic results. And I think that you could easily reach a point where those two things are in conflict, where the Supreme Court starts basically making it impossible for Joe Biden to govern, to have a successful term, to again, undo the wreckage that Trump has left the country with. And in that case, whatever the short-term hit you take from changing the size of the court, I think is much smaller than the hit you take from being unable to fix the economy. So I think that might be right. But before we get to that, could I get you to concede that court packing would be a significant escalation? I don’t know if you can because I feel like if you just take it in terms of, is it a significant escalation if you’re just limiting the frame to Merrick Garland and R.B.G. and the kind of broken promises around that seat? Yes. If you look at it in terms of the entire remaking of the Judiciary and actually just kind of four years of Republicans telling us, we’re going to do it because we can and you try to stop us, four years of just being punched in the face by people who don’t — But wait a minute, look, appointing — I mean, the stuff Trump has done with the Federal Judiciary is the least norm-busting stuff he has done anywhere, right? But I’m saying, you put the Federal Judiciary in the context of installing you know all of these kind of acting lackeys throughout the government, of frankly, demanding that your attorney general arrest your opponent, right? It’s just after four years of this stuff, when Republicans say — He hasn’t. He hasn’t, by the way. You don’t get credit for that. You’re not going to give Bill Barr any credit? [MICHELLE LAUGHS] Come on. He’s standing athwart tyranny, Michelle. [LAUGHING] Bill Barr is saving the Republic right now, as we speak, and you won’t give him credit? So after four years of what they have done to us, I think so many Democrats have been radicalized that when Republicans say, how dare you break these unwritten rules of civic governance, I mean, you just want to laugh. It feels almost abusive. Right, this is how escalation works, right? It’s that both sides convince themselves that the set of wrong is that the other side has committed justify whatever the next step is. I understand, but this is why this kind of both-sides stuff drives Democrats wild because there really is — But with the courts, it is both sides. It’s literally sort of boringly predictable. Democrats start rejecting Supreme Court nominees on ideological grounds. Then you go to the filibuster, then you go to the abusive blue slips. You know, Harry Reid does one thing. Mitch McConnell does another thing. It literally is tit-for-tat. Now, I agree that to make the case that Republicans have escalated in these ways, you have to bring in stuff outside the judicial wars. But within the context of the judicial wars, it’s just all predictable. I don’t think you could have imagined Democrats saying that they just will not let a Republican president fill any judicial seats for years on end, which is what led us up to both scrapping the filibuster — But wait a minute, Republicans didn’t do that. What Republicans did was not confirm Merrick Garland in a six-month window, which was — No, they kind of sneer and be like, Obama left all these seats open. Obama didn’t leave those seats open. They used unprecedented procedural maneuvers to refuse to let Obama fill the Federal Judiciary. When Obama tried to fill the Federal Judiciary, in a normal process, Republicans called it court packing, right? Tom Cotton had a Stop Court Packing Act, which was meant to shrink the size of the D.C. circuit so that there would be less judges for Obama to appoint. Well, first of all, it’s not entirely true. Obama very clearly did not prioritize judicial nominations to the extent Trump did, or you would have had more confirmations in that window. He just didn’t. Second, the reason the Democrats got rid of the judicial filibuster was that they, themselves, had been the ones using it, and the Republican resistance to Obama’s judges was a response to escalation under Bush that was temporarily diffused by the gang-of-whatever deal in the mid-2000s. There’s just a long list of escalating wrongs. And let’s pivot to the second question because I think there, I think you’re absolutely right, that the Democrats — Let’s just end it there. — can’t pack the court. Yeah, you’re right, Michelle. [MICHELLE LAUGHS] I concede everything. I’m going to go march to Bill Barr’s office and make a citizen’s arrest after this podcast. I don’t think there’s any way or any likely way that the Democrats would move to add justices just right out of the gate. I think politically, you need some sort of outrage to cite from a Barrett-Roberts-Kavanaugh Supreme Court. Here, I think the question that sort of hovers over a Democratic outrage — kind of seems like the Supreme Court, with all these Republican nominees, has not been in the business of generating those kind of outrages. I think there’s this assumption among Democrats that, well, if you put these Trump justices in, you are, as you always say, locking in minority rule, making it impossible for Democrats to govern, and so on. But the pattern of all these Republican judicial appointees has been, one, surprising or not that surprising shifts to the left on the social issues that lots of Democrats really care about, joined to a great deal of caution around anything that smacks of 1920s or 1930s-style or even 1890s-style striking down economic legislation, right? So I think that’s bananas because I think that some of the most important decisions are Citizens United, the gutting of voting rights law, the kind of fruits of which we’re seeing play out all over the country and which may, in fact, end up being what gives Trump a second term, despite the manifest wishes of the majority of the American people. I think voting rights and Citizens United are the two biggest examples of sort of activism from the court on the right. The Citizens United decision was correct, and the Voting Rights decision was just sort of John Roberts making policy. But I don’t think either of those cases are examples of blocking sweeping economic legislation. And I mean, I think Roberts did a lot of policy-making that was foolish in his Obamacare ruling. And in hindsight, he would have been better off ruling the mandate unconstitutional and then severing the rest of the law from it because it turns out, the mandate wasn’t that big a deal. But regardless, Obamacare was not overturned. I think there’s no way that the current Obamacare challenge is going to result in the law being overturned. And yes, it is sort of nonsense that the Trump administration is simultaneously pushing it while sort of denying that they’re pushing it. But still, it’s not going to be overturned. And I think Roberts — if you look at the polling on the Supreme Court, Roberts has actually been a really effective politician. The Supreme Court’s approval ratings have dipped a bit, but it’s still the most well-respected branch of government. And Amy Coney Barrett, I’m looking at the Morning Consult poll right now, pending whatever else happens in her confirmation hearing, she has a strong plurality supporting her nomination. I think that’s a case study in how Roberts’s caution has made, I think, a lot of middle-of-the-road Americans feel like it’s not a threat to democracy if Republican jurists are on the Supreme Court. So again, given Roberts’s kind of unremitting hostility to voting rights, and I think there’s a tension between his status as a G.O.P. apparatchik, his unremitting hostility to voting rights and limits on corporate power, and his desire to preserve the court’s legitimacy and to sort of not want to be the fifth vote in a lot of extremely unpopular rulings, I think that changes if Amy Coney Barrett is the fifth vote in those rulings, right? Or if some of those rulings can be 6-3 instead of 5-4. Well, actually, I want to ask you a question. Can I ask you a question? Yeah, you can. So I’m kind of assuming that Roe v. Wade is gone and then you’ll have a bunch of state laws either criminalizing abortion or protecting it. Where does then the pro-life movement stop? I mean, my guess is that the pro-life movement doesn’t say like, OK, now we’re happy. My guess is that they then try to say that actually, the fetal life is constitutionally protected. Before, they wanted some sort of life amendment to the Constitution. It seems like you could get there in other ways. My guess is that Biden would try to pass some sort of national pro-choice legislation. Do you see the Supreme Court then striking that down, and do you see them striking down any state-level pro-choice laws? I guess my answer to the second question relates to my answer to the first question. I don’t think that this court would overturn Roe v. Wade in the way that I think would be constitutionally correct. I have a lot of skepticism that Kavanaugh and Roberts especially would. You’d need at least one of them to get that kind of ruling. What is it about Kavanaugh’s record that makes you skeptical that he would be all in for that? I mean, I don’t think, per se, it’s his record so much as sort of what he represents. He represents a very institutionalist, Chevy Chase part of the conservative legal movement. I have a very political conception of this. I don’t think analyzing his views on precedent exactly is the right way to think about this. I think he, probably like Roberts, cares about how the court is seen and understood in the greater D.C. area, and I think he would see plenty of space to sort of create more room for states to regulate second-trimester abortions where you could do that and say we’ve chipped away at Roe without ending Roe entirely. I could be totally wrong. That’s just my sense and speculation. We’ll be right back to take a lot of your questions. And we’re back. So for a while, we’ve been asking you to send us your questions, election related and otherwise, and you certainly have a lot of them. So now, let’s hear from you. Hi, my name is Max Greenberg. My question is if Trump appoints and confirms, by the Senate, a Supreme Court nominee before election day, what is the incentive of the Republicans to vote for him if they’re disillusioned with him anyway? Hypothetically, if they get what they want, they got that last open seat appointed by a conservative president, why wouldn’t they perhaps vote for someone else? Thank you. So that’s a really good question, Max. When Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away and her seat became vacant, there were a couple of people, I think Sean Trende, the election analyst for RealClearPolitics and some others, who said the really strategic and Machiavellian thing for Trump to do here would be to make some sort of show of magnanimity and say, I’m not going to appoint someone because I’m so sure I’m going to win and then use that to basically boost his own turnout, to sort of raise the stakes in the elections for religious conservatives, especially. And obviously, he hasn’t done that. But from my perspective, I think if you’re a Republican, if you’re especially a conservative concerned about the courts who sort of gambled on Trump last time for the sake of Supreme Court nominations, there’s a totally reasonable argument that you should sort of pocket your gains, basically say, yeah, we got three Supreme Court seats, one global pandemic, and it’s time to walk away from the table and either not vote or vote for someone else and sort of declare victory in the Trump bet. That being said, I think there were a lot of Trump voters, sort of wary Trump voters in 2016, who if you had told them you’ll get three Supreme Court seats out of this administration and then you’ll have a chance to vote a moderate Democrat in, and they would have said, at that point, oh, maybe I’ll do that. But in fact, the way partisanship and negative polarization works, those same people are now obsessed with the idea that you have to keep defeating the Democrats no matter what. I also don’t think that they are disillusioned. A couple of them are disillusioned, but I think most of them are thrilled. And the only thing that makes them unhappy about Trump is that he seems to be doing badly and might let Biden get elected and let Democrats take the Senate. So you’re not going to vote for Biden because you’re angry about that scenario. I remember talking to particularly women on the religious right in 2016, when they were very, very skeptical of Trump, thinking that there might be more kind of religious right abstention than there ultimately was. But what they were skeptical of is that they didn’t trust him to give them everything they wanted, right? They knew, I think, that he obviously doesn’t personally care about abortion and that it would actually be more popular, when he got into office, to move to the center on social issues. And so that’s what they expected and feared that he would do. And then he didn’t do that. And so I think they are, by and large, delighted. I mean, delighted is maybe not strong enough a word for how they feel about his presidency. So I mean, yeah, I think you’re describing a real phenomenon. And this isn’t just true for religious conservatives. I think there’s a broad group of movement conservatives who had that kind of skepticism, ended up being really happy that Trump sort of governed as a more conventional conservative and so are more enthusiastic about voting for him. At the same time, there is also a kind of squishily pro-life evangelical or Catholic swing vote, too. And the inroads that Democrats have made in the sunbelt and in the suburbs and so on depends, in part, on some women, many of them religious women, who voted for Trump last time and aren’t voting for him this time. So different groups have different trajectories, and there is some swing vote that would have fallen into the sort of churchgoing, suburbanite Republican category four, especially eight years ago. Don’t you think? Sure. There’s some of them. It’s interesting. Last night, I sat in on an online focus group of women who voted for Trump in 2016 and are now unhappy with his performance and trying to decide who to vote for. And not one of them wanted Roe v. Wade to be overturned. Some of them identified as pro-life, actually. Not one of them wanted Roe v. Wade to be overturned. So maybe that counts is squishily pro-life. I count it as squishily pro-life. Not one of them was excited about the Amy Coney Barrett nomination. And so you know, whatever, that’s just like a small snapshot. One of an endless multitude of terrible things about this election is that it’s hard to report on the way I would have reported on elections in the past. So I’m just not talking to people the way I would have been out talking to people in the past. But I do think that the people who care the most about the Supreme Court are the people who are the happiest about the Donald Trump presidency. This is from listener Carolyn. She writes, no doubt, you followed the recent interviews with Stuart Stevens, the former Republican consultant who managed lots of high-level political marketing campaigns. The argument to be had, I think, looking into his latest book, “It Was All A Lie,” is whether the thesis is true. Was the outreach to minorities and women by Republican candidates during the Nixon years and then later in the autopsy after the 2012 Romney defeat simply a ruse until the rise of Trump and Trumpism, which allowed Republicans — traditional and newly disaffected voters to unleash their racist and misogynistic ids? I think it’s basically true. I guess where I would differ is that when Reince Priebus commissioned the autopsy after 2012, I don’t think it was sort of him rubbing his hands and thinking, this is how we’re going to cover our tracks until we get to go full white nationalist. I think they sort of thought that this is the way forward for a Republican Party that is going to carry forward the kind of foreign policy and economic agenda. There’s always been this divide between the consultant class and some of the leaders of the Republican Party and a lot of the base of the Republican Party, right? You had a lot of voters who were sort of in it for the racism and a lot of donors and consultants who were in it for laissez-faire capitalism. What I think the Trump years have done is just revealed the depth of that divide, revealed how little the average Republican voter, including people who went to Tea Party protests, ostensibly about small government, ever cared about any of that. Really, the thing that motivated them was racial and gender grievance. Look, some of these consultants, even though I’m so glad that they are joining the side of good against evil now, they obviously understood that those sentiments were there because they made ads for many, many years playing on them. But maybe they didn’t realize the extent to which they were really what was driving things. From now on, I think all the people who were uncomfortable with being a blatantly white nationalist party of patriarchal restoration, those people are gone. And so that’s what the Republican Party is going to be for the foreseeable future. So I have, like, 17 hours worth of thoughts [MICHELLE LAUGHS] about both Stuart Stevens and the Lincoln Project, which is the larger group of Republican consultants taking amazing amounts of liberal money to cut ads against Trump. I won’t go on for 17 hours. But my quick view is, one, a much more limited version of Michelle’s argument. I think that it’s perfectly clear from the Trump era that white identity politics and sort of racial resentment are a bigger part of what counts as right-of-center politics in America than a lot of Republicans wanted to admit five or 10 years ago. And to the extent that people like Stevens are just sort of saying that, saying, we didn’t recognize this part of our party. And now it’s sort of come to the surface, and we’re going to condemn it. I think that’s good, and they should do that. But I also think that the reason that things like white identity politics get activated and become important is often a result of sort of establishment failure, that you can’t understand Trump if you don’t understand how we went from George W. Bush, a president who was trying to do a lot of racial outreach and trying to change the Republican Party’s sort of party-of-whiteness situation, we went from there to here because George W. Bush presided over a disastrous foreign war and then we had a massive recession that was not entirely Bush’s fault but wasn’t entirely not his fault either. And people like Stevens and a lot of the consultants and establishment Republicans who have sort of taken on this role, I don’t see a lot of soul searching and self-scrutiny from them about how that past created this present, how the weaknesses of the Romney campaign, which Stevens himself ran, created this present, right? I think that there needs to be more self-scrutiny from the Republican establishment about what kind of choices lead to a situation where Trumpian populism bubbles up for the next hypothetical time when they or someone like them gets to run Republican campaigns again. So next, let’s take an email from reader Jonathan who writes from our neighbor to the north, from Toronto, Canada. Speaking of your point about undecided voters before, Michelle, he wants to know, how could anyone be undecided in the 2020 election? [LAUGHS] He says, what could possibly happen that could shift a voter in one direction or the other at this point? I firmly believe that anyone not stampeding for the ballot box is waiting for an excuse to vote for Trump that they can use to live with themselves. This is incomprehensible to me. Can you dig into that a bit? So I think that you are right that the people who are undecided at this point are sort of undecided conservatives, right? I think if you are a liberal, if you lean left, you’ve already made up your mind. And so as I said before, I recently was able to look in on this online focus group of women who voted for Trump in swing states, who are very disaffected with his performance and were kind of talking about what they’re going to do in 2020. Most of them are genuinely undecided. And it was a very sobering thing to watch because it’s not that they sort of have strong policy views pushing them one way or the other. It was more just that they sort of seemed to swim in a sea of disinformation and mistrust. What they kept saying over and over again was things like, I don’t know what to believe, I don’t know what’s true anymore. There was one woman who was undecided but was saying, I just wish Obama could come back, right? Which if you’re thinking ideologically, it’s sort of breathtaking that you could wish you could vote for Barack Obama but be undecided if you’re going to vote for Joe Biden. But they didn’t like Trump. They thought he was a bully. Their own lives had become markedly worse. Some of them were out of work because of the pandemic. They had kids home because of the pandemic. They think Trump is embarrassing. But one woman, for example, said that she blamed Trump for the shutdowns, which she didn’t like, was afraid that Biden was also going to shut down the country, which is something that she got from a Trump ad. And so again, I think that for a long time, American politics sort of venerated swing voters as if they were the most judicious voters, as if they were the people who were really not swayed by partisan biases but were really kind of carefully weighing the evidence for and against the two candidates. But in fact, swing voters are the people who pay the least attention to politics. A lot of these women said that they couldn’t watch the news because it was so negative. And so what will change their minds, I guess, will be something that shapes sort of their ephemeral impression closer to election day. And some of them, they were genuinely horrified by Trump’s refusal to condemn white supremacy at the debate. So if there’s something that happens closer to election day that reactivates that, it could push them in one direction. At the same time, they believed a lot of what Trump says about Biden’s senility. Some of them thought that Biden is just a front for Kamala Harris, who at least one of them really distrusted. I know I quote Hannah Arendt way too much, but I’m going to do once again. She wrote in “The Origins of Totalitarianism,” the ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced communist but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction, i.e. the reality of experience and the distinction between true and false, i.e. the standards of thought, no longer exists. So I guess let me say something on behalf of undecided voters. I especially agree that there are just lots of people in America who do not pay close attention to politics at all and who approach elections the way casual football fans approach deciding who to root for in the Super Bowl. And in a democracy of 300 million people, I think the existence of that attitude is both an inevitable thing and not always a bad thing. I guess I disagree a little bit with the Arendt quote. If you’re that voter, you’re probably focused on your own material reality. And so you look at your material reality, and let’s say you’re a working-class American. The first three years of the Trump era were for reasons that may have nothing to do with Trump himself economically better for you than the last four years of the Obama administration then Covid came along and you’re in worse shape but maybe like the voter Michelle cited. You’re worried, well, the shutdowns hit you really hard, and the Democrats seem more pro-shutdown in certain ways than the Republicans. So you’re worried about that. That’s not an unreasonable chain of inferences to make someone undecided. It doesn’t rely just on misinformation or some kind of miasma. So that’s an attempt to partially justify the late-deciding, undecided voter. All right, let’s turn slightly away from politics for our last question. Hi, my name is Olivia Grayson. I’m calling from Philadelphia. And this is a little out there, but I would like to hear you guys discuss a song that is making waves all over the world via the internet. It has a music video that’s gone viral. It’s called WAP, W-A-P. I’ll let you Google it and see what that stands for. [MUSIC - CARDI B AND MEGAN THEE STALLION, “WAP”] I don’t cook. I don’t clean. But let me tell you, I got this ring. Gobble me. Swallow me. ^VOICEMAIL^ It’s by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion. And it’s caused some arguments between my boyfriend and I. I personally feel really sick of people telling me that language like this is empowering. And he’s like, who are you to judge? I would like the hosts to talk about how this song fits into the conversation about feminism and whether that is where feminism is right now. Is this a feminist anthem? So I have very mixed feelings about this. I’m going to be the last person to criticize Cardi B or Megan Thee Stallion or to say that what they find empowering, what a lot of listeners find empowering is not, in fact, empowering. Clearly, it’s empowering for them. Clearly, they has been able to own their own sexuality and exploit it on their own behalf instead of letting others exploit them. Many, many of their fans find that thrilling and emboldening and enriching, and I would never say a word against that. I would say a word against your boyfriend [LAUGHING] telling you that you should find something empowering if you don’t. And to me, that’s the sort of double-edged sword of what’s sometimes called sex-positive feminism, is that it’s great for the people who really do feel liberated by it. And it is not great for the women who feel coerced by it on behalf of feminism, who feel like if they were real feminists, they wouldn’t be as reserved or prudish or whatever. I mean, this was something I felt a ton in my own life, particularly when I was younger. I spent a big part of my 20s in San Francisco in the ‘90s, in the age of feminist strip clubs. And I remember having an extremely high-profile sex-positive feminist really shame me for thinking that I was going to have a monogamous relationship with my then boyfriend, who’s now my husband. I remember being really, really embarrassed and self-conscious about my own self-consciousness, about being naked at Burning Man in public. And my then boyfriend, now husband, actually built me a shower stall so that I didn’t have to take a shower in front of everyone. And so again, I think that there can be something genuinely liberatory for people who felt their sexuality being constrained and controlled. And it can also, I think, feel to a lot of women like a new set of commands and obligations. I’m not sure I have that much to add to that [LAUGHS] except two things. One is that it’s sort of astonishing to think about how we’ve gone from the culture of the same period that Michelle is describing— Michelle is describing the sort of world of sex-positive feminism in late-1990s San Francisco. I think the complete victory of sex-positive feminism since then is kind of striking in that if you went back to the mid-1990s and you had a song like this online and on the airwaves, you would have a really strong contingent of sort of centrist and left-of-center scolds in the Tipper Gore school. And I’m not using scolds — obviously, I’m in favor of scolds. No, Ross is — [LAUGHING] I’m scold positive. That’s high praise. High praise, right. So there was this kind of moralistic, Tipper-Gore-style thing that was a big part of American culture. And that has gone away to the point where the people making the is-this-really-empowerment case are people like Ben Shapiro, who are immediately attacked and mocked and so on roundly. So that’s a big shift. I’m not going to try to get into the heart of Tipper Gore, but part of the political reason for Democrats to make that case, it’s sort of an outgrowth of the sort of Sister Souljah move. They didn’t want to let social conservatives completely outflank them on the right, right? Because the idea that there was this broader social anxiety about a lot of this stuff. That’s true, but I think Tipper believed it. And that has disappeared. Obviously, it has disappeared when you have a president who appeared in soft-core porn films, who paid off a porn star, who is just by far the most depraved and licentious character ever to occupy the presidency, when the religious right has so debased itself, when you have Jerry Falwell Jr. revealed as a— [LAUGHING] Cuck. —alleged, I guess I should say— Cuck is the term. Right. [LAUGHING] Alleged cuck. There is no longer any sort of legitimate right-wing moralism that — Except on this podcast. Come on. [LAUGHING] But nobody on the left feels like they have to prove to the right that they’re not really all sort of depraved San Franciscans. They just don’t because any sort of right-wing credibility on this has so completely collapsed. All right, we need to leave things there. Thank you to everyone who called in or wrote in. And we’ll try to do more questions after the election. And now, let’s do our recommendation. And it’s my turn this week. And I’m going to recommend HBO’s documentary The Vow — Oh my god, I just started watching it. It’s so good. — which is a show about, speaking of sex, what often gets described as a sex cult— Nxivm, this fascinating mix of life-coaching and multi-level marketing and the branding. Like, the literal branding. The literal branding. Like, the branding of flesh. The branding of flesh with the initials of a guy named Keith Raniere, who was, since this cult has been sort of busted up in various ways, the founder and guru. You know, I hesitated to watch it for a while because I sort of thought I knew this story already, right? It’s been pretty extensively reported on. And I really, really did not know this story. I had no idea how huge particularly the multi-level marketing part of this thing was, and it sort of explains how there’s this huge realization and then there’s this smaller group within it, this smaller group of women that are branded and sort of are pledged to Keith Raniere. And they basically have to make themselves blackmailable in order to join the group. They give up some collateral — Collateral, right. — something that would either embarrass you or somehow sort of wreck your life if it was exposed. So that’s how they ensure that they can trust you and that you’ll comply. Well, I mean, I think one thing that’s interesting too is if you don’t know where it’s going, which some people coming to it won’t, although we’ve just sort of given it away, or if you just know generally this is a cult or something, you can watch the first episode and be like, well, maybe some small part of this got out of hand. But in the bigger picture, this seems like a very normal American sort of self-help program. And it’s sort of interesting that it accidentally ended up with some cultish element close to the center. And it’s only over the subsequent episodes that it becomes clear sort of the extent to which the sort of cultish aspect was more sort of central in there all along. So one more time, I recommend that everybody watch HBO’s documentary The Vow. And that’s our show this week. Thank you so much for listening.

I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they intersect. I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis, and decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have four small children, three girls and a boy, and live in New Haven with my wife. @DouthatNYT I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter. @michelleinbklyn “The Argument” is a production of The New York Times Opinion section.
