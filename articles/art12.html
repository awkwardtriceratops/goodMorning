Catch up on the latest news, from the DealBook newsletter. Dr. Anthony Fauci discusses the latest developments in the pandemic, and reflects on his service under six presidents. Masayoshi Son, the founder and chief executive of SoftBank, has made billions from his prescient bets over the years, including an early investment in Alibaba of China. But, he told The New York Times’s Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook Online Summit on Tuesday, he still has made many mistakes. In a wide-ranging interview, Mr. Son spoke as much about his missed opportunities as he did his successes. His philosophy: “I would rather accept my stupidity and my ignorance — my bad decisions — so that I can learn from my mistakes,” he said. “It’s better to accept them, so I become smarter.” He noted that he had the opportunity to become an early investor in Amazon, and even spoke with Jeff Bezos, the Amazon chief, about taking a 30 percent stake in the company before it went public. He didn’t take it. “I’m so stupid!” he said, chuckling. “Don’t embarrass me.” But Mr. Son also admitted making a big mistake with WeWork. SoftBank poured billions into the co-working business, betting that it would transform the nature of offices and “elevate the world’s consciousness” — and then was forced to bail it out after its plans to go public cratered. “We made a loss on WeWork,” he said. “That was my mistake.” But he noted that the company had other hits, and its investments over all are up by at least tens of billions of dollars. Mr. Son also expressed some admiration for Adam Neumann, the once-highflying WeWork chief executive who persuaded him to invest in the company in the first place. Mr. Neumann also made mistakes, Mr. Son said, but “I’m a big believer that he will be successful, and that he has learned a lot from his prior life.” — Michael J. de la Merced It’s the first day of the DealBook Online Summit, featuring top newsmakers in business, policy and culture debating the most important issues of the moment — and the future. Today, speakers will consider the arc of innovation, the prospects for beating the pandemic, the race for a Covid-19 vaccine, and the future of policymaking in Washington. Here is today’s lineup (all times Eastern): 9 A.M.-9:45 A.M. The billionaire founder and chief executive of SoftBank, the Japanese tech conglomerate, will discuss the $100 billion Vision Fund’s biggest bets and his long-term outlook for innovation. 11 A.M.-11:30 A.M. Dr. Fauci will provide an update on the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic and reflect on his service under six presidents. 1 P.M.-2 P.M. The panel will discuss the latest breakthroughs in the development of a Covid-19 vaccine and the challenges of distributing it, both in terms of logistics and winning public trust. 4:30 P.M.-4:55 P.M. One the most prominent progressives in the Senate, with a track record of aggressively trying to rein in Wall Street, Ms. Warren will discuss the post-election outlook for the intersection of business and policy. — Sophia June Every day, the DealBook newsletter helps subscribers makes sense of the latest business and policy news. Here are some of the stories in today’s edition: News Corp bids for Simon & Schuster. Rupert Murdoch’s media company, which owns HarperCollins, is one of two finalists to acquire the book publisher, The New York Times’s Ed Lee reports. (The other is Bertelsmann, which owns Penguin Random House.) A deal would substantially consolidate the book publishing industry, giving Mr. Murdoch ownership of titles by top authors like Stephen King and several hit books critical of President Trump. Airbnb opens its books for its I.P.O. The home-rental giant filed its offering prospectus yesterday, revealing how it has been affected by the pandemic. Revenue in the first nine months of 2020 was down 32 percent, to $2.5 billion, while net losses doubled, to $697 million. Like other tech companies, it has created multiple classes of stock that give its founders disproportionate control. Judy Shelton’s Fed nomination grows shakier. President Trump’s controversial pick for the central bank faced new opposition, as Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said he would vote against Ms. Shelton’s nomination. A confirmation vote may come down to a tiebreaker decided by Vice President Mike Pence. Elsewhere in the newsletter, DealBook reporters note how President-elect Joe Biden was expected to seek the middle ground on an economic rescue package, but in his first major policy speech he seemed steeled for a fight. Analyzing political donations for the upcoming Georgia Senate runoff elections, it looks like the private equity industry is investing in government gridlock, backing the Republican incumbents after donating more, on balance, to Mr. Biden’s campaign than President Trump’s. And with the departure of one of Goldman Sachs’s best-known rain makers, Gregg Lemkau, M.&A. may have less sway at the Wall Street giant. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
