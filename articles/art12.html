By Michael Levenson A wide receiver who was cut from the New York Jets on Tuesday has been charged with fraudulently obtaining a $1.2 million loan from the Paycheck Protection Program and using the proceeds to buy luxury goods, prosecutors said on Thursday. The former player, Joshua J. Bellamy, 31, was charged with wire fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, prosecutors said. He was arrested on Thursday morning and made an initial appearance via Zoom in federal court in Florida. Mr. Bellamy, of St. Petersburg, Fla., signed with the Jets in 2019 but was sidelined with a shoulder injury in March after playing in seven games. He was cut from the team on Tuesday, according to a Jets spokesman. He had played for the Chicago Bears from 2014 to 2018. In a federal complaint, prosecutors said that Mr. Bellamy had taken part in a scheme with 10 other defendants who collectively filed at least 90 fraudulent loan applications seeking more than $24 million in coronavirus relief loans. Many of those loan applications were approved and funded by financial institutions, paying out at least $17.4 million, prosecutors said. Mr. Bellamy became involved, prosecutors said, after Phillip J. Augustin, who was described in court documents as a manager for professional football players, used falsified documents to obtain a fraudulent loan for his talent management company, Clear Vision Music Group L.L.C.
