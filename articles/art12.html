By Maggie Astor The second night of the Republican National Convention will feature some big names, like Melania Trump, the first lady, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. It will also include Nicholas Sandmann, the teenager involved in a confrontation with a Native American man at a protest last year, and Mary Ann Mendoza, a consultant to the We Build the Wall organization, which was recently accused of fraud. Here’s how to watch the convention and who else you can expect to see. Convention proceedings will begin at 9 a.m. Eastern time Tuesday through Thursday but, as with the Democratic convention, the big speeches will happen at night. The Times will stream the convention every evening, accompanied by chat-based live analysis from our reporters and real-time highlights from the speeches. The official livestream will be available on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Twitch and Amazon Prime. ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News will cover the convention from 10 to 11 p.m. every night; CNN from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.; MSNBC from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.; PBS from 8 to 11 p.m.; and C-SPAN at 9 a.m. and then at 8:30 p.m. Mr. Trump’s campaign released a partial list of speakers for Tuesday: Richard Beasley, a former F.B.I. agent and president of a private investigation firm, Global Intelligence Network. Former Attorney General Pam Bondi of Florida, who was part of Mr. Trump’s legal defense team during impeachment proceedings. After her term as attorney general, she joined a lobbying firm that was subpoenaed by federal prosecutors last year. Attorney General Daniel Cameron of Kentucky, who last year became the first Black person elected to that role. He has been in the spotlight recently over his investigation of the police killing of Breonna Taylor. Cissie Graham Lynch, the daughter of Franklin Graham, one of Mr. Trump’s most prominent evangelical supporters. She is a member of the evangelical advisory board of the president’s Faith Advisory Council. Ryan Holets, a detective in the Albuquerque Police Department who adopted a child from a woman with a drug addiction. Abby Johnson, an anti-abortion activist. She used to be a Planned Parenthood clinic director and now runs And Then There Were None, a group that urges employees at abortion clinics to leave them. Jason Joyce, a lobsterman in Maine who is expected to speak about Mr. Trump’s trade and fishery policies, according to The Bangor Daily News. Larry Kudlow, the president’s top economic adviser. Myron Lizer, vice president of the Navajo Nation. He is also a pastor and a former retail manager. Mary Ann Mendoza, whose son was killed in a car crash with an undocumented immigrant. She is a consultant to We Build the Wall, the group whose activities led to Stephen K. Bannon’s indictment on fraud charges. Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez of Florida, the first Hispanic woman elected to that job. During the 2016 Republican primary, when she was backing Senator Marco Rubio, she called Mr. Trump “the biggest con man there is” and suggested he supported the Ku Klux Klan. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. He has an inconsistent history on Mr. Trump: He said in 2016 that “a speck of dirt would make a better president” and opposed Mr. Trump’s declaration of a border emergency last year, but has been supportive on Russia.   Cris Peterson, the chief financial officer of a dairy farm in Minnesota. John Peterson, the owner of Schuette Metals in Rothschild, Wis. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. His appearance may violate rules against partisan activity by State Department employees; in a recent memo to department employees, he said such activities were unacceptable even on personal time. Jon Ponder, the founder and chief executive of HOPE for Prisoners, which provides re-entry services to people released from prison. Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa. Her state was devastated by windstorms this month, and she has praised Mr. Trump on Twitter for approving federal assistance. Nicholas Sandmann, a teenager from a Catholic high school in Kentucky who was involved in a confrontation with a Native American man at a protest last year. Eric Trump, the president’s son and an executive vice president of the Trump Organization. It was reported this week that the New York attorney general’s office had asked a judge to order Eric Trump to submit to questioning under oath. Melania Trump, the first lady. While known for her “Be Best” campaign, she has kept a lower profile than many first ladies. Her convention speech in 2016 was lifted partly from Michelle Obama’s speech eight years earlier. Tiffany Trump, the president’s youngest daughter. A recent graduate of Georgetown Law School, she rarely appears in public. Norma Urrabazo, a pastor at the International Church of Las Vegas and an executive board member of the National Latina/Latino Commission. Robert Vlaisavljevich, the Democratic mayor of Eveleth, Minn., a small town of less than 4,000 people. He has said he supports Mr. Trump because of the president’s support for Minnesota’s mining industry. Republican convention speakers mounted a revisionist defense of President Trump’s record, and the party embraced the grievances of his base. Follow our live updates.
