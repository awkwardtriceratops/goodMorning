But something curious has happened during the last few days. Since election night, when I wake up, that glass of wine has remained full and untouched. I no longer need that glass of wine to take the edge off. There is no edge. My fear has been replaced with optimism. My anxiety has been replaced with hope. And as I danced in the streets with my Pittsburgh neighbors on Saturday night, I was truly happy about the future of America for the first time in four years. Mary Ann Bohrer
Pittsburgh To the Editor: Now that President Trump has lost the election, my family and our nation must acknowledge a debt of gratitude to him. He forced my children, ages 23 to 33, to pay close attention to politics for the first time in their lives. He compelled them, in ways I never could, to understand the intricacies and absurdity of the Electoral College. I am also grateful that he spurred them to activism on behalf of those less fortunate than themselves. And most important, thank you, Mr. Trump, for exposing the evil marrow that simmers in the bones of our nation so that we can get to work on replacing it with something healthier. Steven G. Friedman
Plainview, N.Y. To the Editor: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris certainly deserve all the accolades. But let’s be clear. The 2020 election was not a repudiation of President Trump. Even with Covid-19 laying bare his terrible lack of leadership skills and the worst of his personality, he still received over 70 million votes. Mr. Biden didn’t defeat Mr. Trump; Covid-19 did. Were it not for Covid, I believe he would have been re-elected. Mr. Biden clearly will work to address the virus and rebuild the economy. What is less clear is whether in four short years Mr. Biden can rekindle the cultural and moral ethic that has made America a beacon to the world. He will need all our help to succeed. Let’s hope we, as Americans, are up to the challenge. Barry Lurie
Bala Cynwyd, Pa. To the Editor: I was 6 years old when I heard President Harry Truman announce on our radio that Japan had surrendered and World War II was over. My Brooklyn neighborhood erupted in block parties for weeks — crepe paper hung from every house and pole and fence, people were cheering and crying and dancing in the streets. I will always remember those iconic photos of the celebrations throughout America when our boys came home — photos of such joy and relief. That joy is what I saw again Saturday night as soon as Joe Biden was declared president-elect. The reign of terror of 45 was almost over. How good it is to see us happy again! Here’s to you both, Joe and Kamala. Health, happiness and strength be yours. Barbara Grimaldi
Rockaway, N.J. To the Editor: Kamala Harris greeting the nation as its vice president-elect: That’s what it took for this Gen Xer and immigrant’s daughter of mixed race to, for the very first time, truly feel represented in this country. Natasha Sweeten
Brooklyn To the Editor: I’ve never been so happy to see someone I didn’t want to be president elected president. But Joe Biden may be the Gerald Ford-like figure who can calm the country and the rest of the world. Winnie Boal
