Will They Help Him Win Again?<br></h1><p id="artcont">White evangelicals have time and again offered uncompromising support for President Trump when he needed it the most. By Elizabeth Dias Heather Way, who home-schools her three children in Waterville, Maine, said President Trump had proved to be “a man of his word.” Michael Poe, who works in the hazardous waste department of Gilbert, Ariz., said Mr. Trump aligned with his values, from economic to anti-abortion policy. Jonathan Thorne, a Southern Baptist youth pastor in Fayetteville, N.C., said Mr. Trump defended Christians, whose “rights are always being taken away.” All three are evangelical Christians. All say their support for Mr. Trump has grown even stronger since they voted for him four years ago. And all represent the white, Christian core of Mr. Trump’s base that he needs to hold in order to win on Tuesday, just as they pushed him to a surprise victory in 2016.
