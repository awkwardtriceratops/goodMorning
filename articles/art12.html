Blow Opinion Columnist Saturday, I buried my brother in a segregated cemetery. (More on that later.) He was my oldest brother, Frederick Edward Blow, just 58, and he had battled the autoimmune disease sarcoidosis for nearly two decades. Most people never knew just how ill he was. He hid it well behind a larger-than-life personality. But, in the end, his body was too weakened and too damaged to fight off the final wave of infections. I got a panicked voice mail from my mother the Friday before he died. “Charles. It’s critical, it’s critical. Call me back,” her trembling voice mustered through audible sobs. When I called back, she said that she was in the hospital with my brother and that “we already lost him once.” “What?!,” I asked. “He died, but they shocked him back to life,” she said. He was now breathing on a ventilator. I asked my mother for the prognosis. She said that she didn’t ask many questions because she didn’t want to know the answers. I was shocked. I had texted my brother a few weeks earlier about his recent round of illness, “How are you doing big bro?” He replied simply, “Better, thanks.”
