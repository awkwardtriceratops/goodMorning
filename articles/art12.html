It is separate from the newsroom. It’s hard to overstate the importance of the census to everyday life in the United States. The vast amount of demographic information it gathers determines who gets how much political power in Congress and the states; it steers more than a trillion dollars in federal funding for health care and other critical services; it guides long-term economic decisions by governments, corporations and mom-and-pop stores; it helps determine the location of highways and schools, hospitals and housing, police and fire stations. All Americans, wherever they live and whatever their politics, depend on the census being as complete and accurate as possible. In the middle of a pandemic that shut down much of the country for months, that means allowing extra time for the count to be finished and the data to be processed. So why is the Trump administration fighting this every step of the way? In the best of times, it takes a lot of effort to go door to door to count everyone who didn’t return a census form. In times like these, it’s far harder. That’s why, back in April, as the coronavirus upended life across the globe, the Census Bureau extended its deadline for in-person data collection from Aug. 15 to Oct. 31. The bureau also requested an extra four months to process and deliver its data to Congress, which uses that data to apportion districts for the House of Representatives. This was clearly necessary. Four former census directors agreed with the request. So, at the time, did President Trump. “I don’t know if you even have to ask them. This is called an act of God,” he said. “They have to give it, and I think 120 days isn’t nearly enough.” But Congress didn’t give it — or, more precisely, Republicans in Congress didn’t. After the Democratic-led House of Representatives included the four-month extension in its version of the coronavirus relief bill known as the Heroes Act, the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, refused to sign on. Then, in August, the administration abruptly and without explanation reversed course, announcing that the data collection would end one month early, on Sept. 30. The deadline to deliver the apportionment data to Congress remains Dec. 31, rather than April 30, 2021, as the bureau had requested in the spring. In other words, the bureau has about half the time it initially asked for to complete its work.
