By Mark Landler LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit negotiations fell into disarray on Tuesday, as the government’s top lawyer resigned over Mr. Johnson’s plan to override a landmark agreement with the European Union, and one of his own ministers admitted that the changes would break international law. The head of the government’s legal department, Jonathan Jones, resigned abruptly, the day before the government planned to introduce legislation that would rewrite provisions on the treatment of Northern Ireland, should Britain fail to strike a permanent trade agreement with Brussels by the end of this year. Mr. Johnson’s aggressive move to pull back from the agreement about Northern Ireland underscored his determination for Britain to control its own economic destiny — even at the cost of triggering another confrontation with the European Union, shredding his own diplomacy and raising questions about his government’s commitment to the rule of law. It carried echoes of the moment he suspended Parliament last fall, effectively squelching a debate over his drive to complete Brexit, a maneuver that Britain’s Supreme Court later declared unlawful. Mr. Jones did not detail his reasons for resigning, but The Financial Times, which first reported the news, said he clashed with officials in Downing Street about plans to rewrite the so-called Northern Ireland protocol, a central plank of the Withdrawal Agreement, under which Britain left the European Union last January. The prospect of Britain reneging on a treaty that Mr. Johnson himself signed ignited a firestorm in Parliament, with even the prime minister’s Conservative predecessor, Theresa May, sharply criticizing the government. “How can the government reassure future international partners that the U.K. can be trusted to abide by the legal obligations of the agreements it signs?” said Ms. May during a tense debate in the House of Commons. She negotiated the bulk of the Withdrawal Agreement with Brussels.
