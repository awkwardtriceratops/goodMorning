By Adam Nagourney and Peter Baker Bill Clinton was a prime-time star when Democrats gathered in 2012 to nominate President Barack Obama for a second term, delivering a 48-minute speech that stretched way past his allotted time and all but stole the show from the incumbent. The crowd loved it. But as Democrats hold their virtual nominating convention this week, Mr. Clinton, the 42nd president of the United States, is almost an afterthought. He will speak for less than five minutes on Tuesday, well before the 10 p.m. prime-time hour, in an address that he prerecorded from his home in Chappaqua, N.Y. This will be the first Democratic convention since the 1980s where Mr. Clinton will be little more than a bystander. Other than legacy-burnishing, there is almost nothing explicitly at stake for him politically. He is not running for president, thinking of running for president or promoting a spouse or protégé running for president. Mr. Clinton’s blink-and-you’ll-miss-him moment before a party that once revered him is testimony to how his influence has faded, a reflection of time and age, to be sure — he is turning 74 on Wednesday — but also of the baggage he carries with the re-examination of allegations of sexual assault and harassment over his years in public life in the wake of the #MeToo movement. It is also testimony to a Democratic Party transformation that left Mr. Clinton behind with stunning speed in just four years. It is not purely generational; Mr. Clinton is still three years younger than the man who will be nominated this week, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. It is ideological, too. During his time in office from 1993 to 2001, Mr. Clinton, the “third way” New Democrat, moved his party to the center on issues like trade, welfare and crime — all positions out of step with a party that has shifted steadily to the left. “The world has changed, and with that the Democratic Party,” said Douglas Sosnik, who served as Mr. Clinton’s White House political director. “It is no longer the same party that selected Bill Clinton as its nominee almost 30 years ago, nor the one that made President Obama its standard-bearer in 2008. Vice President Biden said as much, calling himself ‘a transition candidate’ as the party shifts into this new era in American politics.” Mr. Clinton, friends say, remains intensely interested in — and opinionated about — politics, with no shortage of advice for any Democrat who reaches out to him. Among those who have been on the receiving end of his counsel, according to advisers, is Mr. Biden, as well as Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, and Steve Ricchetti, his campaign adviser and a former Clinton White House official. “The president will always be a person who studies politics more than he is in politics,” said Minyon Moore, another former White House aide who speaks regularly with Mr. Clinton. “I don’t know how President Clinton, a man who turns 74 this week, stays on top of so many details about culture, the economy, the trends in America and how things are changing around world.” But in this age of the coronavirus, Mr. Clinton, who underwent quadruple bypass surgery in 2004, has become increasingly constrained and cautious, wary of his health, friends said. He has remained largely secluded at his home in Westchester County and has all but stopped playing golf. “It’s a great sport for Covid, I tell him,” said Terry McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia and a longtime friend and golfing partner. “He just doesn’t take any chances. None.”
