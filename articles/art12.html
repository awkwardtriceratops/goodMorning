Some students write fantasies of escape. Can a new life begin when you are confined with siblings and parents? By Mohammed Hanif Mr. Hanif is a novelist. “Let’s read,” I told the students in my writing class, trying to invoke the authority of my own high-school literature teacher. I was hoping they would unzip their backpacks, pull out the books and start reading. I had become a visiting teacher at a university in Karachi, Pakistan, a couple of years before the pandemic, and I was struggling. It felt nice to be called a professor, but I was reluctant to call my students, “my students.” After a lifetime in journalism and of writing books, teaching seemed like a proper grown-up job. If you get something wrong in a newspaper article, you try to do better the next time. When your novel’s plot goes wonky, you can try a different approach — or repeat the same mistakes and give them another title. But when I started teaching, I realized that I wasn’t likely to get a second chance with the mind of a 20-year-old. I tried to make up for my inexperience with gray-haired authority. I wanted students to read what I loved, but I wasn’t quite ready for how they read it. That day two years ago, instead of opening their bags, they pulled out their phones, as if they had just received an important message or needed to call someone to tell them about the confused man in their class. Noticing the panic on my face, one student pointed out that they were doing their reading on their phone. It took me a few more classes to accept the fact that they had our whole damn syllabus on their phones and were actually reading, not watching TikTok videos. I did well in high school, trying to be the teacher’s pet, the first one to raise my hand when he asked the classroom a question. I had the same instructor for Urdu literature, Pakistan studies and Islamic studies for those four years, and at the beginning of every class, he would ask me to go break a branch from a mulberry tree in the school compound. He would then use the branch to beat up any latecomers or students who hadn’t done their homework. Many of them were my close friends. Mulberry branches are not easy to break, and I felt guilty about being our torturer’s little helper. Occasionally, I would be slow to bring the branch and would find myself included among the boys who had to be thrashed. I’d go from being class monitor to another random bottom my teacher needed to thrash so he could feel like a true teacher. With that kind of education, can I be a real teacher today? My experience was outdated long before the pandemic disrupted our class routine and sent us all online. I struggled with the university’s biometric attendance system: Instead of answering a verbal roll call, students marked their presence by pressing their thumbs on a little glass square. Halfway through the semester I realized that even though I couldn’t do anything about the fancy glass square, I could still do a roll call, say students’ names out loud and let them answer, “yes,” raise their hand or just nod. That two-minute routine made me feel like a proper teacher. And just when I thought I was on top of my teaching game, in March, the coronavirus came to Pakistan and suddenly there was no classroom, no campus, no roll call.
