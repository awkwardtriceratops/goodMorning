You Have Ideas<br></h1><p id="artcont">Credit...Illustration by Nicholas Konrad/The New York Times; photographs by Getty Images Supported by To the Editor: The most important problem with the Supreme Court is that itâ€™s too important. Unlike other advanced democracies, we have punted critical decisions to the courts, making every Supreme Court nomination an existential political crisis. Congress should invoke its Article III powers to remove important legislation from judicial review and correct terrible court mistakes on issues like gun control, money in politics, voting rights and abortion. The second problem is how we select justices. The court composition should not be a random walk decided by the actuarial tables. The best solution is to limit terms to 18 years and stagger them so that two vacancies come up in each presidential term. Alternatively, terms could be limited with justices chosen by lot from members of the 13 circuit courts. And how about more diversity, meaning a moratorium on any more justices from Harvard and Yale Law Schools!
