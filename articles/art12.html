Children Are Frightening Year-Round.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Why little kids have a special ability to creep out their parents. By Christina Caron Some parents don’t need spooky stories or horror movies. The real terror already lives within the walls of their homes. To be clear, I’m talking about little children. Kids can be incredibly eerie. They seem innocent but sometimes appear highly sophisticated. And when they communicate, it’s often in such a simple, uninhibited way that many adults find it unnerving. Especially when their children are talking about something unpleasant. Harper, 6, has mastered the art of delivering grim news in a calm, matter-of-fact way, kind of like a newscaster announcing that the stock market just crashed. “I wouldn’t sleep in your bedroom if I were you,” she once advised her parents. She and her family live in a creaky, century-old white stucco home in Abingdon, Va., which has been in her dad’s family for generations. Shortly after they moved in, she told her parents about the “skeleton men” who inhabit the house and sometimes the yard, too. They’re dressed like soldiers, and one wears body armor, but she isn’t scared of them. They’re more of an annoyance. “She’ll roll her eyes, shrug her shoulders and say, ‘Ugh, one of them walked through the wall again,’” said Harper’s mother, Alysia Hoover-Thompson, 40, who is a psychologist. Harper much prefers her “attic friend,” a nice ghost named Felicia.
