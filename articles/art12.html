By Johnny Diaz and Maria Cramer A California city has reached a $4 million settlement with the family of a Black man who was fatally shot last year as he was having a mental health breakdown. Officials from the city, Walnut Creek, confirmed this week that they had agreed to settle with the family of Miles Hall, 23, who was killed in June 2019 after police officers responded to multiple calls of a disturbance in his neighborhood. “The events of that day were tragic and difficult for all involved — the Hall family, the Walnut Creek community and the police officers called to the scene,” the city, which is about 25 miles east of San Francisco, said in a statement. “While the city recognizes the continuing loss for the Hall family, it is the city’s sincere hope that settlement of this civil lawsuit will provide a step towards healing.” John Burris, a lawyer in Oakland who represents the family, said Mr. Hall’s parents and relatives called the police that June afternoon for help with a young man struggling with mental illness. Mr. Hall’s family has said that he had a schizoaffective disorder.
