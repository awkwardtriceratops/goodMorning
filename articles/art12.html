By Judyth Twigg Dr. Twigg is a professor of political science. Before regulators held their ground earlier this month, there were good reasons to be concerned about President Trump’s push for a coronavirus vaccine. But he had already missed becoming the first world leader to get one approved. Vladimir Putin of Russia had already done it. And in stark contrast to Mr. Trump’s “America First” approach, Mr. Putin is using his under-tested vaccine as part of a global full-court press to win friends and enhance his country’s soft power. On Aug. 11, the Russian Ministry of Health formally approved the Sputnik V vaccine, developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow. Its announcement was a splashy event. A website in seven languages featured a recording of the beeps broadcast from space in 1957 confirming that the first Soviet Sputnik satellite had reached orbit. Those historical echoes pointedly evoked the idea that Russia was No. 1 again. But at that point, the vaccine hadn’t even begun large-scale field trials, meaning that neither its safety nor efficacy had been fully vetted, and its early-phase clinical trial data hadn’t been released. Since then, a peer-reviewed publication of promising early results in the journal The Lancet has raised alarm bells for some scientists who are concerned about potential inconsistencies in the data, which a top Russian scientist has denied. Still, buoyant news of the vaccine saturates Russia’s state-controlled media, and the country stands poised to leverage Sputnik into a significant diplomatic coup. It’s yet another instance — on top of America’s pullout from Syria, its exit from the Paris climate accord and its planned withdrawal from the World Health Organization — where the departure of the United States from the global stage has created a vacuum that Mr. Putin has been delighted to fill. Because vaccines are administered to healthy people, they have especially high regulatory hurdles to clear. Full phase-three trials, designed to pick up rare side effects and to test effectiveness among diverse populations, generally involve thousands or tens of thousands of people. At approval, the Sputnik vaccine trial included just 76 people. The Moscow mayor’s office is currently taking up to 40,000 volunteers through final-stage trials while simultaneously offering the vaccine to frontline medics and teachers. Jumping the gun carries potentially deadly consequences, including renewed spread of the virus if a weakly effective vaccine lulls people into complacency on mask-wearing and physical distancing before herd immunity has been established. In the United States, the vaccines that are likely to be candidates for emergency-use authorizations by the Food and Drug Administration are at least partly through phase-three testing. Of course, Sputnik may turn out to work just fine. Russia has plenty of world-class scientists, and the Gamaleya Institute claims to have had a head start. The institute points to its development of an Ebola vaccine and says Sputnik is just a slightly modified version of its vaccine for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. There’s no evidence, though, that those vaccines have actually been deployed in a significant way anywhere in the world. Now the scramble by countries to secure a potential coronavirus vaccine is looking a lot like a replay of what happened in the 1990s with antiretrovirals to combat H.I.V./AIDS and in 2009 with the H1N1 influenza vaccine: Wealthy nations are buying up the initial supply, most likely leaving only leftovers for the rest of the world much later, if at all. The United States, for example, has secured advance purchase commitments for over 800 million doses of at least six candidate vaccines, all for itself. Compounding an image of selfishness, the Trump administration confirmed last month that it would not join Covax, an effort by dozens of countries to provide for the pooled procurement and equitable distribution of vaccines. This decision has created the political space for Russia to cultivate the role of benefactor, even though it too has not joined the Covax effort.
