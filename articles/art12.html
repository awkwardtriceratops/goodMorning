Experts Worry It’s Too Soon.<br></h1><p id="artcont">The White House physician, Dr. Sean P. Conley, predicted that the president could safely return to “public engagements.” Experts questioned the doctor’s rationale. By Katherine J. Wu The White House physician, Dr. Sean P. Conley, predicted in a memo released Thursday that President Trump could safely “return to public engagements” on Saturday, based on the date on which he tested positive for the coronavirus and his response to treatments. The document, which offered a brief overview of Mr. Trump’s vital signs, said that the president had completed his “course of therapy for Covid-19” and had “remained stable and devoid of any indications to suggest progression of illness.” But news of Mr. Trump’s potentially imminent return to public appearances or the campaign trail was met with skepticism and alarm from medical experts, who suggested it was premature and questioned whether the end of his isolation met guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
