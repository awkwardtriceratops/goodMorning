They will focus on the real-world impact she might have as a Supreme Court justice on health care and access to abortion. By Shane Goldmacher and Katie Glueck For Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the Democratic Party that he now leads, the selection of Judge Amy Coney Barrett by President Trump on Saturday puts a name and a face to the urgent threat they believe a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court poses to decades of progressive laws and protections. Not that Mr. Biden and the Democrats want to focus on Judge Barrett herself. Instead, Democrats pressing to slow or stop the advancement of Mr. Trump’s pick are determined to frame the debate around the real-world consequences — especially on health care, but also on abortion — of what would be the biggest ideological swing on the high court since Justice Clarence Thomas replaced Justice Thurgood Marshall a generation ago. For Mr. Trump, the choice of Judge Barrett represents a welcome chance to shake up the race, in which he has been trailing in the polls, and potentially to address a staggering gender gap by shoring up his standing with conservative women who are alienated by his personal style and other elements of his record. He and other Republicans hope to personalize the court fight around Judge Barrett, a Catholic with seven children — all of them teenagers or younger — including two adopted from Haiti and a son with Down syndrome. In the White House Rose Garden ceremony, Mr. Trump described Judge Barrett’s legal qualifications as “unsurpassed” and her record as “beyond reproach.” But he also sought to cast her as a busy working mother with a personal story that, Republicans hope, will resonate with many Americans — and one that will complicate the Democratic calculus about how to respond to her nomination. “If confirmed, Justice Barrett will make history as the first mother of school-aged children ever to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court,” Mr. Trump said. In her own speech, Judge Barrett talked both about her professional experience and her reputation in her hometown as a “room parent, car pool driver and birthday party planner.” The nomination also provides Mr. Trump with something of a leading woman as part of his 2020 ticket, and with a ferocious confirmation battle that could shift some national attention away from a pandemic that has cost the lives of more than 200,000 Americans and toward the kind of culture war turf that Mr. Trump is most comfortable occupying. Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, signaled immediately that Democrats would oppose the choice from a policy standpoint, not a personal one. “For four years, President Trump has tried to crush the Affordable Care Act in the Congress and the courts,” she said in a statement. “This nomination threatens the destruction of lifesaving protections for 135 million Americans with pre-existing conditions together with every other benefit and protection of the Affordable Care Act.”
