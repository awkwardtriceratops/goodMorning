Can It Handle a Pandemic?<br></h1><p id="artcont">The building that is home to Manhattan’s Hunter College High temporarily closed after three students tested positive for the virus. By Jazmine Hughes Hunter College High School in Manhattan is one of the nation’s most prestigious high schools, with a famously rigorous curriculum and alumni like Justice Elena Kagan and the Broadway composer Lin-Manuel Miranda. But the elite school is also known for one other thing: its strange, fortresslike building. The structure on the Upper East Side was designed to look like the armory that was once on its site. Many classrooms have windows so narrow that they only let in slits of sunlight. Some classrooms have no windows at all, which is why students often call it “The Brick Prison.” In other words, it’s a very problematic place to hold classes during the pandemic. Before the school reopened last month, teachers were so concerned about the school’s airflow and ventilation that they took school administrators to court and staged a protest. The entire campus, known as Hunter College Campus Schools, serves kindergarten through 12th grade. Well before the pandemic, there were problems with asbestos and black mold in the building. School officials assured the teachers and worried parents that the school was safe. But on Monday, the family of a kindergartner reported to the school that the child had tested positive for the coronavirus. On Wednesday, Lisa Siegmann, director of the campus, sent an email to parents saying that two more kindergarten students in the same class had tested positive. Hunter’s 94th Street campus would be closed on Thursday for a deep cleaning and the building would reopen on Monday, Ms. Siegmann said.
