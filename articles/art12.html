By Joe Coscarelli A request by the pop singer Britney Spears to substantially change the setup of the court-approved conservatorship she has lived under for 12 years will not be decided on until February, a California judge said this week amid a flurry of filings by Spears and her family. Spears, 38, remains one of the most beloved and best-selling stars of the modern era, but has had her life and finances carefully controlled by a complex and largely private legal arrangement — one typically used for the old, infirm or disabled — since 2008, following her much-publicized struggles with mental heath issues and substance abuse. For more than a decade, Spears’s father, James P. Spears, known as Jamie, has overseen much of the singer’s career and personal life as conservator of her person and estate, though he stepped down last year, citing health problems. Spears, through her court-appointed lawyer, Samuel D. Ingham III, said this week that she was “strongly opposed” to having her father return to his role as her conservator, indicating that she was willing to fight him in court. Ingham said that Spears preferred to keep her temporary conservator, Jodi Montgomery, in the role overseeing her mental health care and more, and requested that a bank be in charge of her estate. To justify the changes, the lawyer pointed to Spears’s desire to no longer perform for the time being, and left open the possibility that she would “seek termination of this conservatorship in the future.”
