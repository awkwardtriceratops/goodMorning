By Sopan Deb and Marc Stein RIGHT NOW The Lakers push their lead to 12 early in the second quarter. The Miami Heat are in another must-win game tonight, with the Los Angeles Lakers still just one victory from claiming the franchise’s 17th championship. Behind Jimmy Butler’s second triple-double of the N.B.A. finals, the Heat forced a Game 6 against the Lakers, who were seconds away from victory on Friday. Now the Lakers will turn again to LeBron James, who is seeking his fourth tittle, and Anthony Davis, who is after his first. Click here to refresh for live updates. The Lakers started out slowly, but Miami’s turnovers allowed the Lakers to build some momentum, as Los Angeles took a 28-20 lead into the second quarter. LeBron James scored 9 points and grabbed 5 rebounds. Anthony Davis had 8 points and added 3 rebounds, but he also picked up two fouls, which may cause issues as the game progresses. With 1:09 left in the first, Goran Dragic entered the game for his first action of the finals since Game 1.  Miami, which has never led, was 4 of 8 from 3-point land to keep them within striking distance of Los Angeles. The Lakers did most of their damage in the paint, often with James and Davis bulldozing to the rim. Jimmy Butler is in survey mode early for Miami. He has taken only one shot from the floor in the game’s first eight-plus minutes, but the Heat are hanging in just fine, trailing only by a point (17-16). The Lakers’ LeBron James, by contrast, has a quick 6 points, 4 rebounds and 2 assists early. Miami’s Duncan Robinson got hot from 3-point range in Game 5. Tonight he has opened with two 3s so far in the first quarter. The shots came amid a sloppy start for both teams. The Heat started 3 of 9 from the field and the Lakers began 4 of 10. Anthony Davis already has two turnovers while the Heat have three of their own. With 6:18 left in the first, the Lakers lead, 13-8. Read more about Robinson’s hot shooting in Game 5: Goran Dragic, the Heat guard, has missed the past four games after tearing a ligament in his left foot during Game 1. It’s unclear how much playing time he’ll get, if any, but at the very least, his presence should be a morale boost for Miami. Entering Game 6, the Lakers are making an adjustment right from the start: Alex Caruso will make his first playoff start in place of Dwight Howard. Howard has struggled on the defensive end for the finals and having Caruso take his place will allow the Lakers to play small from the outset. Danny Green, the Los Angeles Lakers guard, told reporters on Sunday that he and his fiancée had received death threats following Game 5. “I’ve gotten so many messages,” Green said. “I can’t even hit the delete all button. I just don’t read them. I know she probably doesn’t get as many, and she doesn’t have as many followers so she probably can see more of it. I had to ask. I said, ‘Are you getting death threats?’ She’s like, ‘Yeah, you are too.’” He continued, “I don’t know, because I don’t really pay attention or care, nor am I shaken or worried about it.” At the end of Friday’s game, Green missed a wide-open jumper that could have won the game for the Lakers and sent the team to their 17th championship. Green finished the contest with 8 points on 3-of-8 shooting. Several of his teammates had far worse games, but Green was targeted in particular for scorn, especially on social media. One of the most high-profile Lakers fans angry at Danny Green was Snoop Dogg, who on his Instagram story, posted several expletives directed toward Green. “I’d give anything to get that shot back again, trust me,” Green said Sunday. “You’re going to make some. You’re going to miss some. It’s part of the game.”
