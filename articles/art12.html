By Taylor Lorenz Chris smiles widely as a video of Miso Chan, a transgender creator presenting as a young woman with pink hair, plays next to him. A song with the lyrics “Now I know what’s real and what is fake,” loops in the background. Then Miso Chan rips off their wig, pulls tissues out of their shirt and is revealed to present as male. Chris’s face drops to a wide-eyed deadpan expression. The video has been viewed over 1.7 million times — and its comment section is filled with cruel remarks. “This is why I have trust issues nowadays,” one person replied. “Imagine what it’s parents thought,” said another. Chris, who is 17 and uses the name @Donelij online, has grown an enormous audience on TikTok. Before his account was banned on Tuesday he had amassed more than 2.5 million followers. Another one of his accounts had more than 2.2 million followers, but, on Friday afternoon, both of Chris’s backup TikTok accounts were banned as well. (“This account was banned due to multiple community guideline violations,” read a banner atop the account.) “It’s stressful,” he said by phone. “That’s how I got my money.” Chris’s account is known in the TikTok community as a reaction account, an account where someone creates reaction videos that appear alongside other TikToks. Reaction and commentary TikTok channels are a growing niche on the platform and have been taking off in recent months. Nearly all of Chris’s videos follow the same format: a video loops to his right, he smiles, sometimes gives a thumbs up, then something happens in the video and his smile drops. The majority of Chris’s videos are reactions to anodyne moments. In one, his smile drops when a man slams a brick of tofu in his own face; in another it’s when cockroaches appear onscreen. Some of his videos, however, feature reactions to LGBTQ creators. He has a shocked expression when men put on skirts, when a man sucks on a straw, or when trans people reveal transformations over time. Even though he never says a word, thousands of people have called them out for being homophobic. Young gay and trans TikTokers who have been featured in Chris’s reactions report they have suffered vicious harassment from commenters and in messages. Some have deleted their accounts.
