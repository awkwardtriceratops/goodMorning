By Steven Lee Myers and Javier C. Hernández President Trump has brought China’s relations with the United States to their lowest point in years. Joseph R. Biden Jr. could prove, from the Chinese vantage point, to be a tougher and more complex challenge. Mr. Biden, according to analysts in China, could do more damage than Mr. Trump by pursuing a more coherent strategy to counter China’s global agenda. Mr. Biden has vowed that if elected, he would take a harder line on climate change and China’s crackdowns on ethnic minorities and Hong Kong. To China’s leadership, he is the candidate more likely to restore strong ties with American allies and mobilize other nations to pressure China more effectively. “Biden would make the hard lines more effective and more efficient,” said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. “He might resort to more sophisticated and coordinated tactics against China.” Mr. Trump, who has once again made China a pillar of his campaign, repeatedly claims that he is the tougher of the two candidates where Beijing is concerned. He has launched a costly trade war against China, taken aim at its rising technology industry and repeatedly blamed it for the spread of the coronavirus. He has also alienated leaders in Europe and Asia and showed a willingness to overrule his own purported security concerns to strike deals that help American companies, as he appears to have done to allow TikTok to continue to operate in the United States. In China’s hawkish quarters, in fact, there are some who believe that Mr. Trump’s “America First” presidency has, on the whole, benefited China by reducing American global leadership. A popular meme that has circulated for months mocks him as “Build-the-Country Trump,” a pun on a revolutionary name that suggests Mr. Trump has done more to make China — and not the United States — great again. In public, Chinese officials have not taken sides or commented on the two candidates’ prospects. Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, and other officials have also rejected claims that Beijing is seeking to influence or otherwise interfere in the presidential election.
