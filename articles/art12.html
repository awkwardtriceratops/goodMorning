TRANSCRIPT This is a momentous occasion. I mean, the geek in me is amazed that we — no one would have thought. I think, you know, even when we looked back at the first discovery of the virus, that less than a year later we’d be authorizing and then distributing a vaccine. So I think it’s just a testament to the decades of science and technology and research that’s gone into the development of that vaccine. I think it’s a testament to the work of regulators internationally working together. It’s a testament to our team that’s really dedicated an incredible amount of time and energy and resources to do that. And I think, you know, it’s an exceptional day for Canada. When we do an authorization, it means that we’ve looked at it and the benefits outweigh the potential risks. But it is still a drug. It’s still a vaccine, and there are potential risks, even if they’re rare. So that’s why it’s important that we continue to monitor it. So I would say to Canadians, you know, we’ve authorized it. If it is their turn to get the vaccine, they absolutely should feel comfortable getting that. But we still do need to continue to monitor it as we would any product, because, obviously, when we do the research, the research are done in clinical trials. They’re done in smaller groups of people under ideal conditions. And we need to get information from the vaccine as it goes out and starts to get used in higher numbers of people, not only in Canada, but around the world. By Ian Austen OTTAWA — Canada on Wednesday become only the second Western country to approve a coronavirus vaccine, a week after Britain did so and a day before U.S. regulators will meet to consider taking that step, opening the possibility that Canadians will start being inoculated next week. The regulatory agency Health Canada approved the same vaccine, created by the American company Pfizer and a German firm, BioNTech, that was authorized in Britain and is up for a decision in the United States. Canada’s move marks another milestone in the global fight against a pandemic that has killed more than 1.5 million people, continues to spread rapidly and has driven the world into a deep economic crisis. Health Canada said that it had completed a rigorous, independent review of the data from clinical trials on the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness, which involved tens of thousands of people — the same kind of scrutiny applied by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. British regulators, in giving emergency approval, relied largely on Pfizer’s own analysis of that data, the standard approach in much of the world. Bahrain approved the same vaccine on Friday. “It’s a testament to the work of regulators internationally,” said Dr. Supriya Sharma, the chief medical adviser at Health Canada, the regulator. “It’s an exceptional day for Canada.” The go-ahead means that Canadians could receive the vaccine — which requires two doses, weeks apart — before Americans do, though Pfizer is based in the United States. That is likely to aggravate President Trump, who has demanded faster action by the F.D.A. and was angry that Britain, which began inoculating people on Tuesday, had acted before the United States. The first shipments to Canada, which will total 249,000 doses by the end of the month, will come from a plant in Belgium, officials said. Other vaccines are close behind in the approval processes in Europe and North America, and still others are in development. Vaccines developed in Russia and China are already in use — the United Arab Emirates gave full approval to a Chinese inoculation on Wednesday — though clinical trials on them are still underway. Canada, which has a population of 38 million, has agreed to buy up to 76 million doses from Pfizer, and 414 million doses of other potential vaccines from other companies, but the rollout will take months. Similarly, Britain has arranged for far more doses than it will need, in case some vaccines are delayed or do not pan out. The Trump administration has only ordered enough to inoculate about 15 percent of the U.S. population, and in July passed up an offer from Pfizer to buy more in advance. Maj.-Gen. Dany Fortin, the Canadian military officer overseeing the distribution of the vaccine to provincial health care systems, said that Pfizer would start shipping it from a plant in Belgium on Friday. That could make it possible, he said, for Canadians to begin receiving shots as early as next Wednesday. The vaccine must be kept at extremely cold temperatures until within a few days of use, making transportation and storage a challenge. Once it reaches Canada, it cannot be used right away because it must be thawed and prepared for injection. Canada has 14 depots across the country with special freezers for the vaccine. General Fortin said it would initially be distributed to all 10 provinces, which would then be responsible for injecting people. Officials said the far northern territories, which are not equipped to handle the logistical challenges that go with the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, would have to wait for another vaccine. It will be up to Canada’s provincial governments to decide who will be vaccinated first. Dr. Howard Njoo, the country’s deputy chief public health officer, said a federal panel has recommended that the first injections go to people over the age of 80, residents and workers of long-term care homes, health workers and Indigenous communities. François Legault, the premier of Quebec, said his province would first target long-term care homes, which have been the main source of Covid-related deaths in the province. Dr. Sharma said that the vaccine had been subjected to the same degree of scrutiny as any previous drug or vaccine. But to accelerate the process, Health Canada reviewed data from clinical trials and manufacturing tests as the data was being generated, allowing for a “rolling review.” In the past, the department only opened reviews when all trials and tests were complete. She said that the final data needed for approval arrived late Tuesday evening and was reviewed overnight, which allowed the approval to go forward. For now, Health Canada has approved the vaccine only for people over the age of 16; it is waiting for further data from Pfizer before approving it for children. Canada’s review, Dr. Sharma said, supported Pfizer’s finding that the vaccine was 95 percent effective. It remains unclear how long the resulting immunity lasts. Canada is currently reviewing three other vaccines for approval. One developed by another American company, Moderna, and the National Institutes of Health, is the farthest along, Dr. Sharma said — as it is in the United States. Other officials have predicted that Canada will administer 2 million doses of the Moderna-N.I.H. vaccine plus 4 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine during the first three months of 2021. When asked why her group was able to approve the vaccine ahead of the F.D.A. in the United States, Dr. Sharma said, apparently jokingly, “we’re just better.” She added, “We’re not in a race with any other regulator, we’re trying to beat the virus.” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged Canadians to continue to respect public health rules. “It’s a good news day for Canadians but we are not through this yet,” he said. “We have a tough winter to go through.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
