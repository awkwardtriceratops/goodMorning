By Rachel L. Harris and Lisa Tarchak Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants. Our Opinion writers have offered their takes on who won last night’s debate, the only chance for Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence to come face to face, albeit through plexiglass, as we approach the climax of the election. As the nominees and Mr. Pence’s pesky fan left the stage, we turned to our readers to find out what you thought. Among thousands of responses, many noted a dramatic increase in both substance and etiquette compared with last month’s presidential debate: “I’m giving it to Senator Harris for delivering the consistent and truthful hammering of the Trump administration that Biden failed to achieve in the previous debate,” wrote Alan Zhou in Boston. “For Pence, the pivotal moment was the conclusion of his first response, when everyone could emit a sigh of relief knowing that he wouldn’t echo last week’s performance by Trump,” wrote Dave Stauffer in Red Lodge, Mont. As Jay Orchard in Miami Beach, Fla., put it: “Never has something so boring been so appreciated.” More thoughts from our readers follow. They have been edited for length and clarity. R. Hassan, Geneva: Mike Pence was the more effective speaker. He made the best use of his time and was skilled at cutting into Kamala Harris’s time in a way that did not appear aggressive. He manipulated facts in a suave manner and managed to attack Kamala’s record in convincing ways. Elizabeth Quinn, Los Angeles: Kamala Harris, hands down. She was clear on policy, she engaged with the viewing audience and she held her own against a slew of lies and interruptions. As a woman, I know that fine line we have to walk between being assertive and showing leadership without coming across as hostile and overly emotional. She never missed a beat. James Evans, San Antonio: Pence won because he was more forthright, sincere. Does that mean I will change who I’m voting for? Maybe not. But Pence clearly had Harris against the ropes on packing the Supreme Court. Adams Wofford, Chapel Hill, N.C.: Harris was impressive. She was like Wonder Woman debating Plastic Man. She gave generally truthful answers and seemed to possess a fund of knowledge. Chris Masterson, San Francisco: It’s hard to pick a winner when the country is so divided. I think Pence spoke directly to the fears of older, whiter Americans and I’m sure a lot of what he said resonated. Overall, however, Harris was the stronger debater. Pippa Norris, Cape Cod, Mass.: Senator Kamala Harris is a clear winner: Avoided clichés. Showed empathy. Hit the detailed policy marks. Didn’t interrupt Pence but didn’t back down either. An intelligent woman. Looks like a future President Harris to me.
