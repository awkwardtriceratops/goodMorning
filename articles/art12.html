By Alan Blinder ATLANTA — For the first three weeks of its college football season, the Southeastern Conference and its powerhouse teams like Florida and Alabama dodged the worst of the problems that other leagues and schools had confronted while playing during the coronavirus pandemic. Then came this week: swells of virus cases and contact traces in at least three football programs, the postponements of two games and the hasty isolation of college football’s most renowned coach, Nick Saban of Alabama, after he tested positive for the virus before the season’s most anticipated showdown, his second-ranked Crimson Tide’s Saturday night matchup against No. 3 Georgia. More than a month of college football games in leagues across the country has shown the fickle and treacherous reality of playing during a pandemic. No week has unfolded as planned, and as of Thursday night, 31 games involving Football Bowl Subdivision teams had been postponed or canceled for virus-related reasons since late August. Hundreds of players, coaches and staff members nationwide have tested positive for the virus in recent months. “We’ve just got to take it week by week,” said Derek Mason, the Vanderbilt coach, whose SEC game this Saturday against Missouri was postponed until Dec. 12 because his team would not have enough scholarship players available. “There is no monthly plan. You’ve got to go week by week, day by day.” This data does not include games that were canceled or postponed before Aug 26.
