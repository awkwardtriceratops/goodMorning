By Gail Collins and Bret Stephens Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every week. Gail Collins: Bret, three weeks until the election. I know there are people who claim to be undecided when pollsters call, but I think they’re just being contrarian. Do you believe there are people who are still making up their minds? Bret Stephens: Yes, I do. And possibly still enough to decide the election. I think of the undecideds as being divided into two camps. Camp 1: Voters who were leaning toward Joe Biden but were dismayed by last summer’s rioting and aren’t entirely confident that a Democratic administration would stand for law and order. Camp 2: Voters who were leaning toward Donald Trump but are lately being reminded that the president is best analogized as an unstable radioactive isotope that just happens to be in their water supply. Gail: I like that analogy. Maybe Biden could do an ad campaign: “Say Nope To The Isotope.” Bret: In the last week, Trump has given Camp 2 plenty to think about, particularly with his post-hospital tirade against William Barr for not indicting his political opponents, and against Mike Pompeo about releasing Hillary Clinton’s emails. I hope the attorney general and secretary of state are savoring the wages of their toadyism. Gail: “Don’t Be A Sycophant; Reject the Elephant!” Bret: “Just Say No To the Schmo?” “His Veep Is Also a Creep?” Gail: OK, I’ll stop. Any chance something will happen that switches a lot of minds? Bret: I think Kamala Harris mostly helped things with her performance in the vice-presidential debate. Trump actually called her a “monster” and a “Communist,” which is enough to make the ghost of Joe McCarthy blush. (Well, almost.) To most voters, I think she came across as composed, confident and decidedly unscary. The only real weakness I noticed was her refusal to answer Mike Pence’s challenge on whether a Biden administration would pack the Supreme Court. Bad idea in 1937. Bad idea for 2021, too. Gail: You know I agree in theory, but letting the status quo go on would reward Republicans for Mitch McConnell’s totally undemocratic refusal to bring Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland up for a vote, not to mention the Republicans’ outrageous decision to push Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination through the Senate just days before the election. Bret: We probably agree that a 6-3 split in the court is bad for its own public legitimacy, no matter whether it’s the conservative or liberal side that has the majority. But if a President Biden and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer pack the court by adding, say, four justices, then a future Republican president will inevitably add seven more justices, and on it will go. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was right when she said that nine justices was a good number.
