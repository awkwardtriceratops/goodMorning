By Joanne Kaufman Carol Morgan called her Chevrolet Tahoe, Thelma; she christened her diesel truck, Louise. It was only reasonable then that she would demonstrate at least as much regard for the house she built with her former husband in north metro Atlanta. Welcome to Thistledown, named for the prickly purple-topped weed that dependably covers large swaths of the property every summer. “I had never owned a house with a name before. But it’s a house on 20 acres so it just seemed like it needed a name,” said Ms. Morgan, the owner of a public relations and marketing firm. For a while, she toyed with “Thistle” but “‘thistle’ by itself didn’t work,” Ms. Morgan said. A body of water known as Two Run Creek runs along the edge of the property; that, too, was on a list of name possibilities, but — who can explain why — didn’t feel right. Thistledown it was. There’s no place like home. But plenty of people think that home by some other name makes it even more special. “Your home is your identity,” said David Wilk, the director of the real estate program at the Temple University Fox School of Business. “People may name their house to impress others, but mostly it’s a way to make their house seem more lovable and more interesting. “What we’re learning in these Covid times is that our homes are our safe spaces and our palaces no matter their size,” Mr. Wilk continued. “Naming a house is a way to emphasize its importance to the owner.” It also can change the perceptions of visitors. So said Robert Fowler, co-founder and chief executive of Catalyst Creativ, a Manhattan-based marketing and branding company, who, with his husband, Anthony Rosen, recently bought a house in Roxbury, Conn., that after many suggestions from friends, including “Night at the Roxbury,” became known as Fern Hollow. It was a name inspired by the property’s topography and by the bracken that grows in profusion in the yard. “If you’re going to a Four Seasons Hotel it creates a different set of expectations than if you’re going to a Doubletree,” Mr. Fowler said. “I think guests also have a different set of expectations when they go to a house with a name. Maybe it seems like more of a destination.” The custom of naming a house goes back centuries. For as long as residents of the British Isles have had four walls and a roof over their heads, they’ve given those dwellings a name. And what was good for manors was good for more modest digs. Sometimes, those names were inspired by a property’s setting, sometimes by the occupation of the owner. According to the Land Registry, the department that records the ownership of property in England and Wales, 1.4 million out of 26 million houses across England had names in 2011, the most recent year such stats were collected. The top names, combined with “house,” “cottage,” and “view,” include the words Orchard, Meadow, Sunnyside and Rose. In due course, the house-naming tradition traveled across the ocean and took root in places like Newport, R. I., and on the Philadelphia Main Line, the south and the southwest. “In Texas people have long named their ranches as both a way to help people locate their property or, if they were raising cattle or horses, as a way to build their brand,” Mr. Wilk said. In the United States as in England, vanity house names fall into several categories. Foreign phrases; puns; inside jokes; spiritual allusions (for example, Sanctuary and Paradise), have their fans. Some take their inspiration from a property’s location. They live on a secluded dimple of land so why not “Hidden Valley.” Others, meanwhile, come up with a name that’s, well, very close to home — their own name. Thus, Craigmoor, the handle that the landscape architect Craig Socia gave his nearly one-and-a-half acre spread, an agglomeration of three parcels, in East Hampton. (For the record, the “moor” piece of the name came by way of Wildmoor, the Hamptons house where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis spent some childhood summers, and where, early in his career, Mr. Socia did some landscaping.) “The name unified the property and made it very personal,” said Mr. Socia, who made it official by writing out Craigmoor in wet cement on the driveway. Others choose a name that reflects the appearance of the property. In 2002, when Drew Plant and his partner, now husband, Bill Golden, bought a long, low-slung ranch-style house in Atlanta, it looked so much like a trailer and was situated on a street called Wild Creek Trail, that the couple started referring to their new residence as “Wild Creek Trailer.” “The name stuck,” said Mr. Plant, the head of a public relations and marketing firm, “We use it along with our street address on invitations. “We do it in a lighthearted way but there are people who think we think we’re pretty fancy,” he added. “They come here and they raise their eyebrows when they see it’s a ranch house. They thought it would be a grand historical place.”
