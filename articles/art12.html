Here’s What I Saw.<br></h1><p id="artcont">It all began with an endless gray tunnel. And ended with a vision of how to rebuild our lives. By William Bryant Logan Mr. Logan is an arborist and author. I stood on the edge of a tunnel. I could look down it in both directions. It didn’t end, so far as I could tell. It was wide enough for two big trucks to pass abreast. The color was a uniform misty gray. The light never changed. There was never a breeze. There were only two things there. They stood across from my vantage point, near the opposite wall. Both appeared to be packages, though neither had any logo or label. One was a squat cylinder that might have held a half-dozen dinner plates. The other was a tall rectangle about the size of an old-fashioned stereo speaker. They, too, were gray. My bout with Covid-19 brought me this hallucination. For two weeks, as I lay in bed coughing, I saw it at least once a day. I had no doubt at all that the place was real and that I really stood beside it. In my delirium, I came to know the gray hall pretty well. The pandemic had slammed the brakes on our headlong rush into a touted future and had shut down the entertainments that greased its wheels. The tunnel, I conceived, was the thoroughfare along which all the imported goods and services were supposed to travel, but for the whole time I saw it nothing moved or changed. It made a sort of sense to see the tunnel this way — still, dormant, empty of goods — because so much that I needed could not be had. My doctor told me to take my temperature. I could not buy a thermometer. To clean off the toilet seat with disinfectant wipes. No such product available. To use disposable paper towels and tissues. None to be found. To wear a mask. I coughed all over the two I possessed, and there were no more anywhere. My hallucination was a vision, and this is what it told me: If you insist on bringing an endless stream of items into your life from around the world, you will bring with it unwanted guests. Then, your busy, Technicolor life will turn still and gray. When you treat the world and everything and everyone in it as parts of a vast web of goods and services, the living beings who are at its nodes will suffer.
