By Gail Collins Opinion Columnist We’ve been through a lot these last few days, people. Decades from now, some of you are going to have to answer your grandchildren when they ask you about the Time of the Two Presidents.

I’m hoping he’ll refuse to leave his room and security agents will end up carrying him out of the White House in a blanket.
