In her stirring essay “The Difficult Miracle of Black Poetry in America,” June Jordan recalled serving as the final judge for a poetry prize in the mid-1980s. As she sifted through the last round of manuscripts, she began to jot down recurring nouns: moon, elms, lilac, gulley, tundra. “Sixteen different manuscripts of poetry written in 1985 and not one of them uses the terms of my own Black life!” she noticed. The poets, all white, wrote of pumphandles and snow geese, never of low wages or police shootings, never of the global events of the era — of apartheid in South Africa, famine in Ethiopia. “I did not and I would not presume to impose my urgencies upon white poets writing in America,” Jordan wrote. But she marveled at the persistence of Black poets, so intent on writing about freedom even as their work was derided as “topical” or “sloganeering”: “This is the difficult miracle of Black poetry in America: that we persist, published or not, and loved or unloved. We persist.” The new Library of America anthology “African American Poetry: 250 Years of Struggle and Song,” edited by Kevin Young, is a monumental tribute to that persistence, from the colonial period to the present. It features poems on injustice, harassment, hunger — protests on the page — but also rapturous odes to music and food, to gawking at beautiful strangers, to boredom and birth pains and menopause, and, yes, to moon, elms and lilacs, too. Young — who has been called “America’s busiest poet” — has written numerous poetry and essay collections and edited anthologies of verse about grief and jazz. He is the poetry editor at The New Yorker and the director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the New York Public Library. In January, he will begin a new role as the director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. His many endeavors are linked by the effort to rescue from oblivion, to supply context, to indicate points of continuity while insisting on the multiplicity of experience. One of Young’s achievements with this new book, six years in the making, is in surfacing lesser-known writers — specifically women writers, like Anne Spencer and Mae V. Cowdery, forgotten figures of the Harlem Renaissance — and interrogating why their work went missing. Did they never publish a book? Did they live in a time, like the 1980s, with scant institutional support for Black poets? Did they write in trivialized forms? Were they forced to keep their writing secret?
