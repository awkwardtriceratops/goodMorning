By Tim Wu Mr. Wu is a co-author of “Who Controls the Internet?: Illusions of a Borderless World.” Put yourself in the shoes of Russian or Iranian leadership for a moment. Why not interfere with the voting in the U.S. presidential election? What could be more advantageous than catalyzing a bitter and protracted battle over the results of the election, with a chance of igniting civil unrest throughout the country? Sure, it might not work — but with little to lose and so much to gain, why not try? When it comes to foreign election meddling in elections, disinformation is a serious threat, but the most disruptive form of intrusion is electoral cyber-interference: the freezing of voting systems, the mass deletion of voter registration information, altering vote counts and so on. Such feats may not be easily accomplished, but if they were successful, they could throw the United States into chaos. The risk is not hypothetical. American intelligence agencies, having hacked into Russian computer networks, report that Russia recently infiltrated some voting systems in the United States. If Russia or another country were to alter tallies or voter information in just a few swing states, it could threaten our confidence in the results of the election. That is why this week, Joe Biden and President Trump should threaten punishing retaliation should another nation attempt such forms of electoral interference. They should stress that by “interference” they do not mean propaganda or influence campaigns, but rather direct attacks on the election, which are attacks on political independence and thus a form of illegal aggression. And they should warn that such attacks will lead to destructive consequences — as permitted by international law — for the offending nation and its leadership. Deterrence is a standard component of military strategy and foreign policy. The formula is well established and historically effective: Clearly establish what action is forbidden and credibly commit to delivering a significant punishment if the action is taken. But despite the danger of electoral interference in the election, the United States has not taken these steps, at least not in public. It is true that Mr. Biden recently warned that should he become president, Russia would pay an “economic price” for any inference in the 2020 election, but that modest threat — which did not distinguish between propaganda and electoral manipulation — likely didn’t change the calculus in Moscow. Instead, the United States is relying on a different strategy: attacking the attackers, or “defending forward.” In the past few weeks, for instance, the United States Cyber Command and a group of companies including Microsoft took steps to disrupt Trickbot, a network of secretly connected computers that could have been used to attack our election systems. Defending forward is a good strategy and should be pursued. But it accepts the status quo — that our foes are likely to continue to attack our elections. The goal of deterrence, in contrast, is to make leadership in places like Russia and Iran think twice before even trying. We need to pursue both strategies in parallel.
