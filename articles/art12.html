But race is complicated in South Africa, and so is his story. By Lynsey Chutel JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The deadly encounter between the police and a young man from the projects, set off public outrage with all the familiar scenes: shrines of flowers and stuffed animals, clouds of tear gas and barrages of rocks aimed at officers in riot gear, and impassioned slogans. “Say His Name” read one poster. “Coloured Lives Matter,” said another. This police killing occurred not in Minneapolis or Ferguson or Cleveland but in South Africa, where the anger and distrust of law enforcement authorities mirror that in communities across the world, but the geography of racial tension is more complex than white vs. Black. The young man who was shot last month, 16-year-old Nathaniel Julies, was of mixed heritage, or, as it is still known, colored, a vestige of apartheid-era South Africa’s racial classification. Two of the three officers arrested in the case are also colored, and one is Black. When Nathaniel’s mother, Bridget Harris, saw first his body, she said, she was shocked by the gunshot wounds. “We couldn’t count,” she said. “It’s too many.” Death at the hands of the police in South Africa is hardly uncommon — by one estimate, each day a South African dies in a police action. But this particular shooting in Johannesburg unleashed passionate protests that commanded an unusual degree of attention, inside South Africa and out. And the explanation, at least in part, is that this was no ordinary young man who was killed. Nathaniel was seriously disabled by Down syndrome, and barely able to form complete sentences. A familiar figure in his Soweto neighborhood, Eldorado Park, he was often seen hanging out in local stores in the hope someone might buy him his favorite cookie, or on the dance floor with his signature moves. He was known as Lockies, and many in the neighborhood made a point of looking out for him.
