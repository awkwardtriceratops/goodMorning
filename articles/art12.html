By Julie Bosman CHICAGO — Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old accused in the fatal shootings of two protesters during demonstrations in Kenosha, Wis., has become a cause célèbre for conservatives who insist he acted in self-defense. Hundreds of thousands of dollars from strangers have poured into his legal fund. And on Friday, his lawyer successfully delayed a typically routine extradition from his home state of Illinois, arguing that Mr. Rittenhouse should remain in a facility there for his own safety rather than be transferred to Wisconsin where he is to face charges in the deaths. “There is danger to this detainee,” John M. Pierce, a lawyer for Mr. Rittenhouse, said in a court hearing on Friday, adding that the situation surrounding Mr. Rittenhouse’s prosecution had been inflamed by the presidential election. Mr. Rittenhouse appeared on a live video stream from a juvenile detention facility in Lake County, Ill., wearing a face mask and a baggy black shirt, and staying silent during the proceedings. Judge Paul B. Novak of Lake County Circuit Court scheduled another hearing on Mr. Rittenhouse’s extradition, which his lawyer has promised to fight, for Oct. 30. Though brief, the hearing on Friday, coupled with court filings this week, offered a glimpse into what could be Mr. Rittenhouse’s defense during a trial. Mr. Rittenhouse has been charged with six criminal counts, including first-degree intentional homicide, for the shootings on Aug. 25 that left two protesters dead and a third injured. The shootings occurred after scuffles broke out between demonstrators, who were protesting a white police officer's shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black Kenosha resident, and armed civilians with guns who said they had come to downtown Kenosha to protect businesses and private property after two nights of fires, looting and destruction.
