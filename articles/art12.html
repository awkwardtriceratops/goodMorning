Then, there’s a third option: Rent a giant house with friends and take remote classes from a far-flung locale. It’s an adventure, it’s potentially cheaper than living in a college town and it’s more fun than Zooming from your parents’ basement. Taylor Lorenz, a Times technology reporter, described it as “off-off-off campus housing,” inspired in part by social media influencers who have formed “collab houses” across Los Angeles. Two groups of students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will spend the semester in Hawaii. At least seven groups of friends rented large houses in the greater Salt Lake City area. And more than 30 Chinese students who attend American universities plan to live in adjoining properties in Beijing. The houses range from lavish mansions to budget-friendly solutions. Morgan Margulies, a rising junior at Columbia University, will live in Santa Cruz, Calif. with nine friends from other colleges. “I am a first generation, low-income student and this is my cheapest option,” he said. Admittedly, college students and communal housing seem like a dangerous mix. In the United States, more than 26,000 people have been infected at colleges and universities, with clusters popping up in dorms and Greek houses nationwide. Students say they plan to adhere to a strict two-week quarantine, are choosing locations near major hospitals and have developed plans in case someone got sick. (“I think a lot of that was to placate their parents,” Taylor said.) But they will be traveling to rural areas from around the country and the world. “This plan is crazy, but what isn’t crazy right now?” said Anika Beamer, 19, a rising junior at Grinnell who is relocating to Utah. “Our lives have been uprooted and we’re hoping to find a sliver of comfort and adventure.”
