By Maria Cramer The San Francisco board of supervisors is poised to pass legislation Tuesday aimed at cracking down on frivolous calls to 911 against people of color, a move that will make it the latest city to enact an ordinance against racist calls to the police. The legislation, the Caution Against Racial and Exploitative Non-Emergencies Act, has a memorable and provocative acronym — CAREN. Although the lead sponsor denies this was his intent, the name evokes “Karen,” the online meme that has morphed into a symbol of racism and white privilege. On social media, a Karen is a busybody, typically an older white woman, often caught on video calling 911 to report a Black person doing something benign. Critics say that “Karen,” in itself, is a stereotype. The CAREN proposal is expected to have unanimous support when the board votes Tuesday night. All 11 board members signed on as co-sponsors. A second, largely procedural vote is expected next week. Mayor London Breed plans to sign the legislation after that, a spokeswoman said. “We wanted to put something in place that’s going to stop these racist, prejudiced calls that weaponize police against Black people and people of color,” said Shamann Walton, the Democratic supervisor who introduced the legislation.
