But it hasn’t always worked out. Compiled by Mark Shimabukuro Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. When you’re a Times journalist spending Thanksgiving outside the United States, the day isn’t exactly all turkey and football. Improvisation replaces tradition, family is where you find it, and work comes first. We asked a few of our international correspondents about memorable holidays past. Motoko Rich, Tokyo bureau chief A few months after we arrived in Japan in 2016, my husband cooked a turkey. We were lucky to have an oven large enough to accommodate a small bird and invited Japanese friends of my parents’ generation to Thanksgiving dinner, offering culinary gratitude for the support they had given us when we first moved to Tokyo. We shopped at a Western-style supermarket for brussels sprouts and imported cranberries, shutting our eyes to the exorbitant price. We mashed potatoes and toasted bread for stuffing, though it ended up too crunchy, like croutons. My Japanese godfather said they were his favorite part of the meal. Our friends also brought Japanese side dishes: homemade pickles, plump inari (sweetened rice wrapped in fried tofu skins) and marinated enoki mushrooms. The flavors mingled on our plates. Our friends, who speak little English, managed to communicate with my husband and children, who spoke little Japanese. The following year, we dumped the turkey. The inari rolls and pickles stayed. Vivian Yee, Cairo bureau chief Thanksgiving 2019 fell on the one-year anniversary of my leaving New York for Beirut, Lebanon, where I had started covering the Middle East, and where I knew almost no one. New York Thanksgivings, seven years running: a friend’s parents’ place on the Upper West Side, glugs of red wine, beagles barking, arguments about movies. Beirut Thanksgiving, Year 1: Unclear! I’d have to make it up. Dinner for 10 other Americans and friends of Americans became dinner for 22 and then 30. Terrifying. Fortunately, my not-New York apartment could handle it.
