CNN and MSNBC dismissed the claims. By Tiffany Hsu and John Koblin Nearly a decade ago, Donald J. Trump had a regular Monday slot on the Fox News morning show “Fox & Friends,” and it has been a reliably friendly venue for him throughout his presidency. But more recently, the show has been cool to his unsubstantiated claims of widespread vote fraud. On Thursday’s episode, the co-host Steve Doocy challenged Pam Bondi, a former attorney general of Florida and a Trump supporter, over her comment about “fake ballots that are coming in late.” “Pam, did you just say fake ballots?” Mr. Doocy asked. “There could be. That’s the problem,” Ms. Bondi replied. “Have you heard stories of ballots that are fake?” Mr. Doocy pushed back. “And if so, just tell us what you know.” Ms. Bondi did not cite specific examples, instead saying, “We know that ballots have been dumped.” The night before on Fox News, the star opinion hosts Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity spoke ominously about the vote results — but stopped short of endorsing President Trump’s dismissal of the election as “a fraud on the American public.” Mr. Hannity expressed his doubts about the vote in a series of questions: “Do you trust what happened in this election? Do you believe these election results are accurate? Do you believe this was a free and fair election? I have a lot of questions.” Laura Ingraham, who was in the White House’s East Room early on Wednesday when the president called the election “an embarrassment to our country,” spoke more pointedly on her 10 p.m. show that day. She claimed that Democrats were trying to “destroy the integrity of our election process with this mail-in, day-of registration efforts, counting after the election is over, dumping batches of votes a day, two days, maybe even three days after an election.”
