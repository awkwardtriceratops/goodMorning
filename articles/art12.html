Is That What Women Want?<br></h1><p id="artcont">The pledges on both sides of the aisle have produced mixed feelings among voters, inspiring some while leaving others exasperated by what they see as political posturing. By Sydney Ember and Rebecca R. Ruiz In 1993, when Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg was nominated to the Supreme Court, then-Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. thanked her for saving his daughter “from having to be the second woman nominee to the Supreme Court.” She was confirmed with overwhelming bipartisan support. Twenty-seven years later, as Justice Ginsburg’s death roils the country and injects new uncertainty into an already bitter presidential race, one element is all-but certain: The country will soon have a fifth woman appointed to the Supreme Court. Mr. Biden, now the Democratic candidate for president, has pledged to “make history” and appoint the first Black woman to the Court should he have the chance. President Trump, who is expected to make an actual nomination this week, has made a similar promise. He, too, plans to name a woman — “a very talented, very brilliant woman.” The proclamations from both men about how each would replace Justice Ginsburg, a pioneering force for gender equality on the court, have reflected conspicuous signaling by both parties as they rush to appeal to crucial constituencies ahead of the election. The pledges draw on a traditional political tactic: one way to seek to appeal to women is with women, as surrogates and in positions of power. But that approach has stirred complicated feelings in women across the country — and it may not be the most effective. “Public opinion surveys about political candidates have shown that women have a slight preference for other women, and men have a slight preference for other men, but the more popular response is ‘it depends’ or ‘it doesn’t matter,’” Kellyanne Conway, one of Mr. Trump’s longest-serving aides and a veteran Republican strategist, said in an interview. “There is a difference between sharing my gender and the more consequential sharing my values, principles and positions on issues.” In interviews with voters, lawyers and female leaders across the political spectrum, some women were strongly enthusiastic about the pledges to elevate a woman, some resignedly saw them as flawed but necessary and others harbored concerns of being condescended to and having a significant appointment cheapened. “We need more women in power. It’s crucial,” said Eileen Letts, a former co-chair of the American Bar Association’s commission on diversity and inclusion and a partner at the firm Zuber Lawler. “But in the situation of the Supreme Court, one has to be more careful and more vigilant because a woman of certain ideological beliefs may not be the best person for other women.” Adding to the heated dynamics is the battle over women’s reproductive rights that is almost certain to take place. A conservative majority on the court could overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, a galvanizing issue for activists in both parties — especially women, for whom the issue is deeply personal. Even before Mr. Biden secured the Democratic nomination, he promised to name a woman as his vice president and appoint a Black woman to the Supreme Court as a way to appeal to the liberal, diverse coalitions within his party as a white man belonging to the Washington establishment. His commitments were in line with his record: As a senator, he was more resolved than many colleagues to surround himself with accomplished women, and he still to this day considers the Violence Against Women Act his signature legislative achievement. Mr. Trump and the Republican Party, too, have made pointed appeals in seeking to recast the president’s record on gender and race. At their convention last month, they lined up women to testify that the president was — in private — sensitive and sympathetic, and they stretched to find African-Americans who insisted he was not racist.
