By Azi Paybarah The prosecutor’s office in Tucson, Ariz., announced Monday that it would not bring criminal charges against four police officers in the April death of a 27-year-old man who — while naked, handcuffed and face down on the ground — said he could not breathe and repeatedly begged for water and called out for his grandmother. The death of the man, Carlos Ingram Lopez, rattled the Tucson Police Department, which has long considered itself a model of progressive policing. Three officers linked to the case have resigned; in June, when body camera video from the episode was released publicly, the police chief offered his own resignation, which the mayor declined to accept. Mr. Lopez was experiencing a mental health crisis when his grandmother called 911 for help early on April 21, officials said. What officers did in responding to Mr. Lopez may have been outside the bounds of departmental procedure, the Pima County Attorney’s Office said, but experts said it was unclear if the officers’ conduct contributed to Mr. Lopez’s death or whether he would have died without any police involvement.
