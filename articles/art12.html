By Amanda Rosa A lemon as a side dish. Some lettuce in a plastic bag. A sandwich for a student with gluten allergies. Salads with chicken for vegetarians. Welcome to college. Bon appétit. As students arrive on campuses in New York and elsewhere for another academic year upended by the coronavirus pandemic, administrators are grappling with an array of challenges and, in some cases, hastily rewriting their carefully drawn plans for the fall. It took just a week for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, for example, to move most fall classes online. Columbia University shifted all of its undergraduate classes online shortly before the semester began. Colleges and universities in New York must also figure out how to isolate students coming from more than 30 states for 14 days in an effort to keep the virus from spreading. Feeding those students, it turns out, is a big task. New York University and Cornell, among others, have dealt with it by providing meals at no charge to out-of-state students who have been allowed to move into dormitories before classes start. The prospect of free food may sound good, but what showed up in brown paper bags three times a day at N.Y.U. got poor reviews from students who were quick to share TikTok videos and memes of their unripe oranges, watermelon chicken salads and other unhappy meals. “We have to do a smell test,” Madison Veldman, a first-year student studying film and television, said as she held a bagel to her nose in one TikTok video. Other students, including some who complained about not getting the meals they had been promised, were not so lighthearted in their comments. Annette Yang said that she had not received some meals, and that some of the food she did get smelled as if it had gone bad.
