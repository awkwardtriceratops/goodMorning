The group of fires, known together as the LNU Lightning Complex, has grown to cover more than 32,000 acres and is completely uncontained, the authorities said. Firefighters had hoped for calmer weather overnight, but gusty winds arrived instead, pushing the fire toward vegetation and other fresh fuel, said Lynnette Round, a spokeswoman for California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency Tuesday in response to the fires, which have hit the state as it battles the effects of a sweltering heat wave, rolling blackouts and the coronavirus pandemic. The governor also mobilized the California National Guard to assist with relief efforts.
