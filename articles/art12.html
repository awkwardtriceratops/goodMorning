They are set to take control of Arizona’s House and Senate, while Republicans flipped New Hampshire’s legislature. By Sabrina Tavernise After an election that failed to deliver the powerful gains that Democrats had hoped for, results from statehouses painted a similar picture, with the lowest number of chambers changing hands in more than half a century. Democrats had hoped for a “Blue Wave” to sweep statehouses that Republicans had controlled for years, running expensive ad campaigns and extensive get-out-the-vote efforts. But as the results came in, it became increasingly clear that they had failed on multiple fronts. On Wednesday morning, the results were not yet final, but the National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks state-level races, estimated that only four chambers would flip, the lowest number since 1946, said Tim Storey, an expert at N.C.S.L. Those chambers were the Arizona House and Senate, which the Democrats will now control, and the New Hampshire House and Senate, control of which Republicans wrested away from Democrats, he said. “This is crazy in that almost nothing has changed,” Mr. Storey said. “It really jumps off the page.” Democrats failed to take control of the Texas House from Republicans, a prize that had seemed within reach. They also lost the battle for North Carolina’s House and Senate, chambers they had set their sights on after years of Republican control. And they failed to flip the Iowa House, according to the N.C.S.L. Results for the Pennsylvania and Michigan Houses were still pending.
