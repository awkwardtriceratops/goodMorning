Many people still have no electricity or running water. By Will Wright, Rick Rojas and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs LAKE CHARLES, La. — Days after Hurricane Laura slammed into Louisiana, hundreds of thousands of people remained without electricity on Saturday, with the situation especially dire in Lake Charles, a city near the coastline where nearly all 80,000 residents have been without power for days and many have no running water. President Trump arrived on Saturday afternoon in the troubled city, where residents were just beginning to pick up the pieces after the hurricane that made landfall on Thursday as a Category 4 storm. “Our hearts go out to the families that have lost loved ones,” Mr. Trump said during a stop in Lake Charles, expressing relief that the death toll was not higher. “It’s a tremendous number, but it could have been a lot worse.” But both Mr. Trump and the residents who were returning to their homes arrived in a city still packed with perils, where the streets were obstacle courses filled with tangled power lines, fallen trees and debris from rooftops. “We have water in some locations, but it’s a trickle,” Mayor Nic Hunter said in a telephone interview shortly before Mr. Trump’s visit, describing an overwhelmed water system that, combined with the near-total electricity failure, has left the city foundering in the summer heat. Sandra Staves, who works as a housekeeper at a hospital, returned to her home for the first time on Saturday. Her roof was torn apart, the windows were broken, and water had soaked her furniture and mattress. The power was out and no water ran from the tap. She looked in the refrigerator to find that all of her food had spoiled. “What am I supposed to do?” Ms. Staves asked. “What am I supposed to eat? I have nothing.” The efforts to dig into a cleanup were stalled by heavy rain on Saturday afternoon, adding yet another layer of frustration. “It’s literally like kids and parents and families picking up pieces,” said Layla Winbush, 19, whose family-owned car detail shop was wrecked by the storm. “It’s locals out here on hands and knees.” The extended electrical outages have turned deadly, as the majority of the state’s deaths have come from people who were overcome by fumes after using generators to power refrigerators, lights and air-conditioners.
