It was not immediately clear who fired the shots, or how many people died. By Christine Hauser Multiple people were fatally shot after deputies responded to a call about hostages taken at a house in Salem, the capital of Oregon, on Monday afternoon, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office said. The statement did not say who was shot during the encounter or how many people died, but it said that no law enforcement officers were injured. The sheriff’s office said that at about 12:30 p.m. on Monday, deputies from the Marion County Sheriff’s Office were dispatched to Juneva Place SE in Salem to respond to a “possible hostage situation.” Once they arrived at the home, a call between a suspect and a trained negotiator was arranged. “As the incident unfolded, shots were fired,” the sheriff’s department said. “Ultimately, there were multiple fatalities during this incident, including that of the suspect. No deputies were injured.” It described it as an “officer-involved shooting.” It was not immediately clear who fired the shots or who was in the residence. The statement said the deputies involved in the incident would be placed on administrative leave during the investigation in the city, which is about 45 miles south of Portland. Capt. Timothy R. Fox, the spokesman for the Oregon State Police, which is investigating, said in an email that more information would be released on Tuesday. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
