By Alex Marshall LONDON — Debut novelists dominated the shortlist for this year’s Booker Prize, one of the world’s most prestigious literary awards, the judges announced on Tuesday, while star authors like Hilary Mantel and Anne Tyler did not make the list. Four of the six shortlisted books are from first-time writers, three of whom are American, while the fourth holds dual Scottish and American nationality. Four of the shortlisted books are by women. The nominated debuts include Douglas Stuart’s “Shuggie Bain,” a violent tale of a child growing up in 1980s Scotland; and Brandon Taylor’s “Real Life,” about a Black gay graduate student navigating campus life.
