By Gail Collins Opinion Columnist Already sorta looking forward to the Republican convention next week. The White House says Melania Trump will be speaking to the American people from the Rose Garden on Tuesday. Chances are her speechwriters won’t lift any lines from Michelle Obama like they did four years ago. Although if you hear Melania urging her audience to “grab our comfortable shoes, put on our masks, pack a brown-bag dinner and maybe breakfast, too,” when they go to the polls, you will know what happened. There’s still some first lady fascination at the conventions. Michelle Obama’s feisty first-night Democratic finale had people swooning. (“If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.”) Listening, I remembered the first time I ever saw her at a speaking engagement. It was very early in the 2008 campaign, and she appeared to be a nervous wreck. It wasn’t really the public speaking that scared her — it was the thought that she could say something as an aside, or by mistake, that would screw up everything and ruin her husband’s chance of becoming president. I dare say we can all agree she’s gotten over that. Jill Biden introduced herself to the national audience from a classroom where she used to teach English. Dr. Biden talks a lot about education, which is great. And she can remind voters of her husband’s extraordinary story of achievement combined with personal loss.
