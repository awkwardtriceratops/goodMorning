As we get started tonight, here’s my fun fact of the evening: Joe Biden attended his first convention in 1972. He’s attended every one since – with a brief break in 1988, when he was getting surgery for a brain aneurysm. Good evening, all. In his selfie video, Gov. Gavin Newsom did some fact-checking of President Trump. Mr. Trump threatened today to withhold federal funding for battling wildfires because California doesn’t do a good enough job raking the floors of its forests. Most scientists say that would not stop the fires. The prime-time show begins with archived footage of, no surprises here, Joe Biden. As the Democrats kick off the final night of their convention, Sean Hannity just described it to Fox News viewers as “the worst informercial on the face of the earth.” I know the phrase “a divided nation” is overused…. Michael, how much of this convention is Hannity actually watching, do you think? Church bells! Maggie, Hannity has carried bits and pieces from the convention during his 9 p.m. broadcasts this week, but his show has mostly been devoted to bashing Biden and the Democrats. That was a nice touch that answered your question about governing, Astead, at least for the moment. The segment featured Democrats projecting what it will look like at “this time next year” under a Biden presidency. Andrew Yang is speaking now, focusing in part on some of the wrong-track numbers in polling. He is best known, and best remembered, for his UBI proposal — universal basic income. I think Biden may benefit from low expectations. His reputation for “gaffes” has become so known that I can see him overperforming tonight, as was the case during some of the most critical debates. Astead, I totally agree. And this has been an area where the Trump folks repeatedly damage themselves. An Andrew Yang opener was not on my bingo card. There were rumors he’d pursue a run for New York City mayor next year. Doesn’t he live in Westchester? Not hard to establish residency. And here’s Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Quite a troll by Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Yang. Wow, that was quite a riff on Mike Pence’s name. They pronounced it “Paunce.” They’re questioning how one pronounces Mike Pence, in a troll of Trump and some Republicans floating the false conspiracy theory that Kamala Harris wasn’t born in the U.S.A. J.L.D. is making way more jokes than the past actress-moderators. I like it! Julia Louis-Dreyfus – who, it should be noted, is one of America’s most gifted comic actresses – is doing a bit of a stand-up here, including a fairly amusing bit on “Arrive,” the in-cabin Amtrak magazine. She’s mocking Trump’s well-known lack of interest in reading. And threw out a “god love ’em” – a classic Bidenism. This is much more comedy than we’ve seen on previous nights, which were pretty darn somber. Julia Louis-Dreyfus spent a season on “Saturday Night Live,” so she’s accustomed to live comedy. (Plus she did the “30 Rock” live specials!) The Chicks, formerly Dixie Chicks, changed their name a couple of months ago to lose the Confederate association with their name, as they released a protest song about racial justice protesters.  It’s a big night for women in comedy. CNN reported earlier that Sarah Cooper, whose Trump lip-sync videos are a viral sensation, will make a cameo later this evening. This invocation by Sister Simone Campbell is a reminder of Biden’s faith. An proud Irish Catholic, he often talked about about his faith on the campaign trial. Speaking of comedy, does anyone think Biden will crack any of his signature jokes when he speaks? And here’s Senator Chris Coons of Delaware. Maggie, this segment seems designed in part to counter President Trump’s recent criticism of Biden, that he “hurt God.” This is a really interesting direct discussion of Biden’s religious faith, and once again, meant to be a contrast to Trump, who maintains strong support from white evangelicals. “Joe knows that it’s faith that sustains so many ordinary Americans who do extraordinary things,” Coons says. CNN and MSNBC are running full coverage of the convention from 9 to 11 p.m., and their ratings have far outstripped other networks that only drop in at 10 p.m. It seems like viewers this year have been drawn to a relatively unfiltered broadcast, with fewer interjections from anchors and commentators. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
