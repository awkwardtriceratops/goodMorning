But contrary to Trump administration warnings, Beijing is mostly aiming at Biden campaign officials. By David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth The Russian military intelligence unit that attacked the Democratic National Committee four years ago is back with a series of new, more stealthy hacks aimed at campaign staff members, consultants and think tanks associated with both Democrats and Republicans. That warning was issued on Thursday by the Microsoft Corporation, in an assessment that is far more detailed than any yet made public by American intelligence agencies. The findings come one day after a government whistle-blower claimed that officials at the White House and the Department of Homeland Security suppressed intelligence concerning Russia’s continuing interference because it “made the president look bad,” and instructed government analysts to instead focus on interference by China and Iran. Microsoft did find that Chinese and Iranian hackers have been active — but often not in the way President Trump and his aides have suggested. An assessment by the director of national intelligence last month said China preferred that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. win the 2020 election. The Microsoft report complicated that finding somewhat because it found that Chinese hackers have attacked the private email accounts of Mr. Biden’s campaign staff members, along with a range of other prominent people in academia and the national security establishment, including groups like the Atlantic Council and the Stimson Center.
