Joe Biden should stick to “no names.” By Martin J. Siegel Mr. Siegel is a former Senate Judiciary Committee staff member. What does it mean that we now practically elect our Supreme Court justices? True, they’re supposed to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, not elected, but that’s becoming a quaint anachronism like other parts of the Constitution — the emoluments clause, say, or the idea that laws come from votes in Congress rather than executive orders. In 2016, Donald Trump didn’t simply promise to name conservative justices, he became the first presidential candidate to release a list of actual people, lower court judges, he’d nominate for the Supreme Court. When conservatives pulled the lever for Mr. Trump that year, they knew they were also electing one or more of these judges to fill Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat. The list, which included Neil Gorsuch, is widely credited with helping Mr. Trump win the White House. Now President Trump is at it again: He named 20 new conservatives he’d consider for the court in a second term. “Candidates for president owe the American people a specific list of the individuals,” he claimed, so people can “properly make a decision as to how they will vote.”
