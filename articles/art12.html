A performance that has been worked into Hanif’s memory. “It’s a patient and heartbreaking song, filtered through a vague but believable promise of something better,”  he wrote. “Especially when played live, it feels like you’re nursing an open wound that is slowly stitching itself closed, inch by inch.”  For Ms. Welch and Mr. Rawlings, pandemic isolation has brought about a creative boon. Listen to this narrated story about how, amid the uncertainties of 2020, the pair have returned to what they know: songs about the slow, challenging, beautiful heat of living. This story was written by Hanif Abdurraqib and recorded by Audm. To hear more audio stories from publishers like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android.
