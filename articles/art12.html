Washington May End That.<br></h1><p id="artcont">The app has reshaped the experience of Chinese-Americans for the better, but also spreads misinformation and government propaganda. By Nicole Hong When Sin Yee Tsui immigrated to New York in 1982 to work as a seamstress, it took so long for her to receive letters from China that she did not learn of her father’s death until after his funeral. Everything changed after WeChat, the Chinese messaging app, was released in 2011. She now wakes up every morning to greetings from relatives, in both her old homeland and her new one, a source of cheer during her retirement in Manhattan. “WeChat has made my life in America much happier,” she said. “When I am feeling sad or troubled by anything, I no longer have to keep it all to myself.” But if WeChat — and its billion users worldwide — have created a sense of community and belonging for immigrants like Ms. Tsui, the app has also exposed her to a cascade of information, disinformation and Chinese government propaganda, on subjects as varied as the pandemic, Black Lives Matter and the democracy movement in Hong Kong. Even neighborhood news can be distorted: In August, a false post that said a beloved Chinatown bakery was closing caused a crowd to descend on the storefront. Ms. Tsui’s son, Justin Tsui, 37, even walked to the Manhattan bakery to prove to her that the post was wrong. This powerful combination — the comfort and convenience of connections around the world, the isolation and distortion of an echo chamber — is common to many social media platforms. But WeChat is unique on the American digital landscape in that it has quietly and profoundly reshaped the immigrant experience for one of the nation’s fastest growing ethnic populations, the estimated 5 million people of Chinese descent living in America. It has also drawn the ire of President Trump, who is trying to prohibit it. On Friday, the legal fight over WeChat’s future in the United States intensified when the Trump administration appealed a federal judge’s ruling that had halted the federal government’s ban on the app. The administration has argued that WeChat endangers national security by collecting data from American users that could be retrieved by China’s Communist government. The federal judge in San Francisco issued a temporary injunction last month preventing the ban from taking effect, citing free speech concerns after lawyers compared it to an attempt to shut down a newspaper or television station. The prospect of a ban, though, has rippled through Chinese-speaking communities across the country, with many like Mr. Tsui and his mother expressing alarm, if also acknowledging some ambivalence.
