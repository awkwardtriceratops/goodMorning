Squabble<br></h1><p id="artcont">Supported by Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler took an extraordinary step in urging Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to step down. His office has defended the integrity of the election. By Rick Rojas and Richard Fausset ATLANTA — A rift among Georgia Republicans exploded into public view on Monday as the state’s incumbent senators, both locked in fierce runoff fights for their seats, lashed out at the Republican officials who oversaw last week’s election and leveled unfounded claims of a faulty process lacking in transparency. The all-out intraparty war erupted as the vote count in Georgia on Monday continued to show President Trump narrowly trailing President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia took the extraordinary step of issuing a joint statement calling for the resignation of the Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, and condemning the election as an “embarrassment.” “We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out — even when it’s in your own party,” the senators said in their statement, which did not offer any specific allegations or elaborate on how they believed Mr. Raffensperger had fallen short, except to accuse him of “mismanagement and lack of transparency.” “Honest elections are paramount to the foundation of our democracy,” they added. “The secretary of state has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections. He has failed the people of Georgia, and he should step down immediately.” Mr. Raffensperger dismissed their allegations as “laughable.” “Let me start by saying that is not going to happen,” Mr. Raffensperger said of the request to resign. “I know emotions are running high,” he added. “Politics are involved in everything right now. If I was Senator Perdue, I’d be irritated I was in a runoff. And both senators and I are all unhappy with the potential outcome for our president.” He argued that his office had been transparent, holding regular briefings and urgently updating vote counts. He asserted that the reporting process had been orderly and lawful, and noted that his office had sent investigators to consider allegations of potential illegal voting. He noted, too, that he had a monitor appointed to oversee elections in Fulton County, home to much of Atlanta, which he called “one of our longtime problem Democrat-run counties.” The discord has grown as the election results in Georgia, a reliably Republican stronghold in recent years, have unsettled the state and national G.O.P. With nearly all of the ballots counted, Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump by about 11,400 votes, and Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler were forced into runoff races against Democrats — pivotal elections that could determine control of the Senate. The joint statement by Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler reflected the divide among Republicans in the state, but also came as many in the party have continued to back Mr. Trump as he falsely insists that the election was stolen from him. On Monday, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said Mr. Trump had “every right to look into allegations and request recounts.” Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican who was the former top election official before his 2018 election, sought to find middle ground on Monday. While urging Mr. Raffensperger to take seriously any charges of fraud or irregularities surrounding the election, he also did not join in any condemnation of his successor. “Given the close outcome and the record number of mail-in and absentee ballots cast in this election, this needs to be a wake-up call to the secretary of state’s office to take a serious look at any and all voting irregularity allegations that have been made,” Cody Hall, a spokesman for the governor, said in a statement on Monday. “Georgians deserve to have every legal vote counted in order to have full confidence in the outcome of our elections.” On Monday morning, Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who is also a Republican, said on CNN that he had seen no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the state. “We’ve not had any sort of credible incidents raised to our level yet and so we’ll continue to make sure that the opportunity to make sure every legal ballot is counted is there,” he said.
