During the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, large swaths of New York City looked like ghost towns. Many businesses were closed, and plenty of New Yorkers — particularly the wealthy — fled to second homes. The city has since slowly begun reopening, but things are far from normal. The changes — no Broadway, no nightlife, uncrowded subways — have led some people to proclaim that New York City is “over” as we know it. For instance, in a much-talked-about LinkedIn post this month titled “N.Y.C. Is Dead Forever. Here’s Why,” James Altucher, an author and podcaster, argued that the city was at a low in terms of financial ruin, culture and real estate. “This time it’s different,” he wrote. “You’re never supposed to say that but this time it’s true.” The concern about a second wave of infections has made it unclear when countless employees will return to work. Office towers sit empty. Foot traffic has dwindled in Midtown Manhattan and other commercial centers. And worries about a resurgence of the virus also have New Yorkers leaving faster than some movers can handle. A report last month by the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group, estimated that roughly one-third of the city’s small businesses may never reopen. To that point, my colleague Troy Closson wrote about shops that survived the Great Depression and both World Wars, but were unable to weather the pandemic. Also, a recent study by the city said that about 1,200 restaurants had permanently closed since March. Indoor dining is still not allowed in the five boroughs, and restaurants that are trying to take advantage of outdoor dining are struggling. Even the sounds of the city have changed. Several New Yorkers have argued that cynics aren’t giving the city enough credit. Some have also suggested that the people who fled were wealthy and would have eventually left anyway. On Monday in a Times op-ed, the comedian Jerry Seinfeld responded to the LinkedIn article: “Real, live, inspiring human energy exists when we coagulate together in crazy places like New York City,” he wrote. “Feeling sorry for yourself because you can’t go to the theater for a while is not the essential element of character that made New York the brilliant diamond of activity it will one day be again.” There are glimmers of a rebound, too: According to Resy, a reservation app, restaurants are performing at around 23 percent of last year’s volume. My colleague Sharon Otterman wrote that while that number is still very low, in mid-July it was only 10 percent. And while the city’s vacancy rate is climbing, big companies like Facebook and Amazon have recently acquired buildings in Midtown. Sandra E. Garcia, a Times reporter and native New Yorker, noted to me, “If New York is dead, why was Cam’ron freestyling in Harlem on a hot summer night?” Michael Wilson, a Times reporter who has documented the mood of the city during the virus crisis, said: “I see so many New Yorkers doubling down and riding this out. New York is over when New Yorkers collectively agree it’s over, which is why it will never happen.” Do New York City Voters Want Another White Mayor? N.Y.
