By Jim Tankersley, Alan Rappeport and Emily Cochrane WASHINGTON — The slow resolution of the presidential election, and the growing chance that Democrats and Republicans will divide power in Washington next year, has revived lawmaker interest in reaching an agreement on a new economic rescue package before Christmas. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said on Wednesday that reaching a deal on a stimulus bill would be “Job 1” when lawmakers return for the lame-duck congressional session after the elections. It is possible that some type of stimulus package could be attached to a bill that would fund the federal government past Dec. 11 — legislation that will be necessary to avoid a government shutdown. The chance of a stimulus deal may be rising, but it is unlikely to result in as large a package as Democrats and President Trump were discussing before the election. Democratic leaders, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, had been talking with the White House about a nearly $2 trillion package that would include direct payments to households, loans for small businesses and money for schools and state and local governments, as well as expanded coronavirus testing. Senate Republicans were pushing a bill that would have cost well under $1 trillion, possibly as little as $500 billion. Business groups are mounting a renewed push for a sizable bill, possibly around $1.7 trillion. “There’s no reason to wait,” Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday. Mr. Bradley said chamber members hoped to see legislation resembling a bipartisan proposal in the House that would have included aid for people and businesses, as well as triggers to continue aid or cut it off depending on how the economy fares. Whether a stimulus package becomes reality will depend on several variables, including whether Mr. Trump, whose re-election prospects are fading, is willing to sign a bill. The stakes of the negotiations are also expected to remain murky until it becomes clear which party will control the Senate. Trump administration officials believe that Ms. Pelosi overplayed her hand in negotiations during the summer and fall and that Republicans will be even less likely to go along with a $2 trillion package now that the election is over and the Senate appears less likely to shift to Democratic control. Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said this week that he expected the White House and Congress to agree on another short-term extension of government funding in mid-December. He reiterated that the White House would like to see additional money allocated to the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses and a reinstatement of supplemental benefits for the unemployed. Mr. McConnell on Wednesday called for Congress to act on another stimulus package before the new Congress takes office in January, telling reporters at a news conference that “I think we need to do it, and I think we need to do it before the end of the year.” He signaled openness to addressing Democratic demands, including providing billions of dollars to state and local governments, in part because of the political realities of divided government. But he provided a caveat, saying he would like to see it “done a little more skillfully than simply providing borrowed money for everyone regardless of their need.”
