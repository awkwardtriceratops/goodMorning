By Alex Marshall LONDON — Anna Netrebko, the star Russian soprano, is in the hospital with pneumonia caused by the coronavirus, she said in an Instagram post on Thursday. “I have been in the hospital for 5 days with Covid-19 and will recover soon,” Ms. Netrebko wrote, adding: “Everything will be fine! The devil is not so terrible as it is described.” She was admitted to a Moscow hospital just days after performing at the city’s Bolshoi Theater with another singer who later tested positive for the virus. Scientists have identified singing indoors as a risky activity, and the news will cause concern among the world’s opera companies, which had been closely watching the starry Bolshoi performances as they forged ahead.
