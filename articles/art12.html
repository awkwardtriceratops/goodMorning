By Michael Gold All summer long, educators and officials in Hartford, Conn., readied the city’s schools to reopen in the midst of a pandemic. They rearranged classrooms, adjusted schedules and distributed electronic devices as they prepared to welcome some students back to buildings that had been dormant for months. But on Tuesday, the scheduled first day of the school year, the district found itself paralyzed by a virus entirely different than the one they had been expecting: a ransomware attack that forced Hartford to postpone opening its public schools. Like many districts across the country, the city had adopted a hybrid model for reopening, in which some students would return to school buildings while others would remain in a virtual setting. As city employees continued to restore systems that were compromised in the attack, it was not clear when Hartford’s public schools would be able to start their new academic year, officials said. “As soon as we know, we will share the information,” the Hartford schools superintendent, Leslie Torres-Rodriguez, said at a news conference.
