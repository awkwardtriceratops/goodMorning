By Marie Tae McDermott Good morning. After I wrote about mail-in voting last week, I received a number of great questions from readers who were still flummoxed over the process. After all, voting this year has changed drastically from previous years, partly because of the pandemic and partly because of additional counties participating in the election model laid out by the Voter’s Choice Act. Here are some of the most common questions asked by readers. Does returning one early mean that it will be counted early? Generally, yes. “Early arriving vote-by-mail ballots are typically the first ballots counted,” said Chris Miller of the California secretary of state’s office. Ballots will be processed as they come in. Legislation passed in response to the pandemic allows for mail-in ballots to be processed and counted sooner than in previous years, up to 29 days before the election. Neal Kelley, chief election official for Orange County, told me that he will start mailing ballots on Oct. 5. “If a voter gets it on Oct. 6 and they drive it down to my office and deliver it, it’s already going to start in the system to be processed,” he said. You can track your ballot by signing up for the “Where’s My Ballot?” tool. It will notify you via phone or email when your ballot has been counted. Returning ballots early also ensures that officials have time to send them back if there are discrepancies, like missing or mismatching signatures. While officials can process ballots before November, vote counts, however, cannot be released until 8 p.m. on Election Day. Do you have to turn in your mail-in ballot if you’re voting in person? You should bring your mail-in ballot with you just in case. Whether you are required to surrender it depends on where you live. This year, over four million people live in 15 counties that are participating in the Voter’s Choice Act model, in which vote centers should be able to print out ballots and void mail-in ones for in-person voting. “Vote centers have electronic poll books and ballot-on-demand printers, which allow poll workers to verify the voter’s participation history and provide them their specific ballot type,” Mr. Miller said. However, it’s a good idea to trade in your mail-in ballot even if you are using a vote center. “We strongly encourage voters who want to vote in person to bring their vote-by-mail ballot with them to surrender at the polls,” Mr. Miller said. If you are voting in person at a polling place, you should bring your mail-in ballot and hand it over to poll workers in exchange for a paper ballot. If you forget, you can still cast a provisional ballot, which will be processed and counted once election officials verify your registration. Where can I find the original signature that mail-in ballots are compared with? Voters’ signatures are collected when people register to vote and are stored in a statewide database. However, some readers wrote in saying they are worried that their mail-in ballots will be returned because of mismatched signatures. For people who registered online or through the Department of Motor Vehicles, your signature will be the same as what’s on your driver’s license or state I.D. Mr. Kelley said that he’s noticed that a lot of younger people tend to register this way. Handwritten signatures are more common among older voters.
