For That, We Were Killed.<br></h1><p id="artcont">The people of Nigeria are standing up to a government that seems to hate us. By Eniola Anuoluwapo Soyemi Dr. Soyemi is a Nigerian political theorist. LAGOS, Nigeria — The High Court of Justice is on fire. Behind my home, it has been ablaze since noon. But in reality, the justice system the court claims to represent has been burning for nearly 60 years. Several hours after a shocking crackdown of peaceful protesters by Nigerian security forces, black smoke is replacing the city’s ordinary pollution. Lagos, usually a hustle and a bustle, is dead. “We the people,” begins the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Section 40 guarantees us the right to freedom of assembly. By Section 41, “we the people,” are guaranteed the right to free movement. So, we assembled. And we moved. For that, we have been killed. On the evening of Oct. 20, without instigation, the armed forces indiscriminately opened fire on a crowd of protesters, killing an as-yet-unknown number. Sitting peacefully, a few miles from where I write, the crowd of protesters had resolved to have our government face us, and cease killing us. In Nigeria, the accepted experience with almost all officialdom is aggressive: the civilian officers in full military garb who slap women trying to enter the passport office; the ordinary policeman who pulls his gun on unarmed civilians because they dared to talk back. Violence defines the predictable. It takes an unpredictable, extraordinary level of brutality to cause a storm. On Oct. 3, a video surfaced online that appeared to show the point-blank killing of a Nigerian citizen by officers of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad, commonly known as SARS. In the days since the video’s emergence, people across the country, young and some old, have taken to the streets to protest police brutality and call for SARS’s disbandment.
