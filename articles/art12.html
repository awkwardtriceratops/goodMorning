By Sarah Mervosh, Jack Healy and Patricia Mazzei Three American governors. Four United States senators. At least a dozen members of the House of Representatives. The mayor of Miami. The mayor of Atlanta. A judge in Luzerne County, Pa., population 300,000. The mayor of Oliver Springs, Tenn., population 3,000. And now, the president of the United States. Across the country, scores of elected officials at all levels of government have experienced the alarming moment of finding out that they have tested positive for the coronavirus. Their diagnoses raised all sorts of pressing questions about their health, and the well-being of those around them. But for many politicians, living through the virus has also been a turning point, forcing them to re-examine their own views on the pandemic that has shaken their governments and sickened their constituents. “We are not taking this seriously enough,” said Kevin Brooks, the mayor of Cleveland, Tenn., who spent 11 days in a hospital, sweating through his clothes in unbearable pain. After his release from the hospital in July, he recorded a video extolling the value of face masks. “I think President Trump is possibly going to have a different outlook on Covid now that he’s tested positive,” said Mr. Brooks, a Republican. ”I know I did.” At least nine public officials have died of the virus. They include judges, state legislators from Louisiana and South Dakota, and a Jersey City councilman. The riverfront town of Washington, N.C., is still reeling from the death of Mac Hodges, a four-term mayor nicknamed “Bear,” who bounced from Rotary talks to budget meetings to East Carolina University tailgates and seemed to know everyone in the 9,500-person town. “It was a wake-up call for us: We need to be more careful,” said Virginia Finnerty, a city councilwoman who tested positive for the virus in July. “We live in a small sheltered town. We were taking precautions, but somewhere in our subconscious we thought, ‘It’s not going to affect us.’”
