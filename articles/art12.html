By Michael Paulson Tony Awards administrators have decided to hold an online ceremony this fall to honor shows that opened before the coronavirus pandemic shuttered Broadway. The American Theater Wing and the Broadway League — the two organizations that present the awards — announced the decision Friday morning. It was not immediately clear how many shows would be eligible for consideration. Twenty plays and musicals opened during the abbreviated 2019-20 season, but a few might be deemed ineligible because they were open for such a short period of time that not enough Tony nominators or voters got a chance to see them. The awards administrators said in a statement that they would determine eligibility “in the coming days.” But it is widely expected that the new musical “Girl From the North Country” and a revival of “West Side Story” will not be eligible to compete because they opened too close to the shutdown. “Though unprecedented events cut the 2019-2020 Broadway season short, it was a year full of extraordinary work that deserves to be recognized,” Charlotte St. Martin, the Broadway League president, and Heather Hitchens, the American Theater Wing president, said in a joint statement. “We are thrilled not only to have found a way to properly celebrate our artists’ incredible achievements this season, but also to be able to uplift the entire theater community and show the world what makes our Broadway family so special at this difficult time. The show must go on, no matter what — and it will.” The decision comes after months of uncertainty over whether and how to recognize the work that was staged on Broadway between May 2019, when a revival of “Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune” opened starring Audra McDonald and Michael Shannon, and March 2020, when the pandemic forced all 41 Broadway theaters (along with most others across the country) to close. There were 16 plays and musicals scheduled to open between March 12, when Broadway shut down — a British pop musical, “Six,” was scheduled to open that very night — and April 23, which was the scheduled eligibility cutoff date. Two shows that were in previews but never opened — a new Martin McDonagh play called “Hangmen” and a revival of Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” — have said they would not attempt to open after the shutdown; the others are expected to attempt to try again next year. The awards administrators debated combining the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons for one televised ceremony next year, but as it has become increasingly unclear when Broadway might reopen, they decided to forge ahead with this plan. Producers have said they would refund all tickets purchased for performances through Jan. 3, and some shows have announced an intention to open as soon as next March, but many industry leaders believe the theaters will remain dark longer. Other entertainment industry awards shows have also been grappling with the impact of the pandemic. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said in June that it would extend the eligibility window for next year’s Oscars, and delay the ceremony, to April from February. The Tony Awards were established in 1947, and had been broadcast on CBS since 1978. This year’s ceremony was originally scheduled to to take place on June 7 at Radio City Music Hall. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
