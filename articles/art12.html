It Never Happened.<br></h1><p id="artcont">In 2016, agency scientists deemed hair straighteners containing formaldehyde to be unsafe, according to newly obtained emails. By Roni Caryn Rabin It’s been more than a decade since a popular hair treatment called Brazilian Blowout appeared in salons, promising months of straight hair after a single application. But soon users were complaining that the product emitted noxious fumes that stung their eyes, brought on headaches, nosebleeds and nausea, and made it hard to breathe. Government health inspectors said the culprit was formaldehyde, a chemical that has been linked to cancer. Although the labels on the bottles claimed the product was “formaldehyde-free,” it contained a solution called methylene glycol, which converts to formaldehyde gas after coming in contact with air. The Food and Drug Administration has allowed Brazilian Blowout and similar products, called keratin treatments, to remain on the market despite the recommendations of its own scientists, according to internal agency emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the advocacy group Environmental Working Group and shared with The New York Times. F.D.A. scientists deemed hair straighteners with formaldehyde unsafe in 2016, and agency lawyers started drafting rules for a proposed ban, the emails show. “This is a very big deal for us, and for the public,” an agency scientist wrote to her colleagues on July 26, 2016. But a ban never happened. Internal emails about the drafting of new rules continued for a few months before the process appears to have abruptly halted. F.D.A. officials have not yet provided the Environmental Working Group with any internal documents or communications on the topic written after December 2016, despite the group’s request.
