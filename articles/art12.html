Skintight.<br></h1><p id="artcont">In the pursuit of surveillance as a service, Jeff Bezos is intent on recording even our moods. How much personal data is too much to give to Amazon? By Kara Swisher Contributing Opinion Writer Here’s a tip: Don’t get into a car with your family and tell everyone that Jeff Bezos is listening through the device on your wrist. “He’s going to blackmail you,” my wife joked. “That’s creepy,” my nephew said. My younger teenage son was more clear, telling me to turn it off right away. He was the most perturbed — and correctly so — by my testing of Amazon’s new health and wellness tracker, called Halo. My family’s reaction was no surprise. A few years ago, my older son showed his wariness of the surveillance capabilities of tech companies: He went around our new house unplugging all of the Google Nest devices, even though his other mom had been a top Google executive. With Halo, I was working my family’s nerves, especially because of its opt-in feature that uses a microphone and machine learning to analyze the user’s voice, giving insight into how people perceive the user’s tone. In simple terms, along with my sleep and steps, the device can see my halo, as well as my horns, recording my amusement and anger and joy and irritation. Halo is Amazon’s attempt to compete with the Apple Watch and Google (which is awaiting approval of its acquisition of Fitbit) in the health-tracking arena. I got on the wait list for it as soon as it was introduced in the summer, and it arrived on Halloween. I strapped on the attractive band and turned on all the intrusive bells and whistles, which Amazon had trumpeted as good for me. That first day a vexed emoji told me I was “stern” or “discouraged” for 16 percent of the day. “You had one phrase that sounded restrained and sad” for 1.6 seconds at 12:30 p.m., it reported, although I have no idea what that phrase could have been. But 8 percent of the day, including for 14.4 seconds at exactly 11:41:41 a.m., I was “satisfied,” with “two phrases that sounded satisfied, delightful or appreciative.” Later, for 1.2 seconds at 7:18:30 p.m., I was “afraid, panicked or overwhelmed.” Yipes. Was I? Maybe so and Amazon knew it, which definitely scared me. Still, I left it on, even though I keep my Alexa-powered Echo devices unplugged until I might need them. I wanted to see exactly what Amazon is capable of doing with this new wearable. The company has been on an endless quest for information about me (and you, too). The device widens the reach of the company’s personal-data grab, adding a user’s body tone and a body-fat analysis to the information it vacuums up, which required photos of me in as pared down a state of dress as possible. “You have to send Jeff Bezos nudes?” my wife asked, ever more concerned by Halo. Not exactly, I replied, even though it works best with form-fitting clothing rather than my typically baggy ensemble. She was not assuaged, even though she, too, had fallen into the Amazon vortex during the pandemic, after the birth of our baby last year. Being a new mom pushed her from being a Never Amazoner to being a regular user of its home delivery services. “I hate myself for this,” she said many times, like when the giant box of diapers arrived on our doorstep.
