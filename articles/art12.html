POP & ROCK Best to stay in this Halloween weekend, lest you encounter 2020’s most frightening monster: the superspreader event. Luckily, plenty of musicians are offering at-home entertainment to keep the holiday spirit alive. Though the experimental musician Circuit des Yeux recently announced her retirement from online concerts, she will perform virtually one last time under Saturday’s full blue moon. Her brew of folk and electronica radiates spooky intensity; for this set, streaming on Constellation Chicago’s YouTube channel at 9:30 p.m. Eastern time, she’ll give her spin on fan-selected covers. Tickets, available at Constellation’s website, are $15. The touring rap festival Rolling Loud made a memorable New York debut last October. This year, its online proxy, Loud Stream, presents a more modest alternative. The Young Thug protégée Gunna headlines on Friday; the emo rapper Trippie Redd tops the bill on Saturday. Performances will stream free on Twitch, beginning both days at 6 p.m. A small Brooklyn club with a big heart, Baby’s All Right will continue its ongoing series of virtual gigs on its website with a Halloween variety show, starting at 9 p.m. on Saturday, courtesy of the video production company House of Nod. The indie-rock group Japanese Breakfast will headline; tickets are available on a sliding scale at Eventbrite, with proceeds benefiting the artists and the staff at Baby’s All Right.
