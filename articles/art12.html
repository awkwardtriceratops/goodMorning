By Ana Facio-Krajcer, Will Wright and Johnny Diaz IRVINE, Calif. — Tens of thousands of Californians were forced to flee their homes on Monday as a new fire ripped through Southern California, with high winds and low humidity combining to create some of the most dangerous fire conditions yet this year. A vegetation fire called the Silverado Fire broke out on about 10 acres near Irvine early on Monday. By about midday, it had already burned about 4,000 acres. Cal Fire, the state’s fire agency, said about 4,000 firefighters were fighting 22 wildfires across the state. This year, more than five million acres have burned across California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington State. The rapidly expanding Silverado Fire was exacerbated by high winds and dry conditions, quickly forcing about 60,000 evacuations. Videos from the scene showed gusts blowing as hard as 80 miles per hour.
