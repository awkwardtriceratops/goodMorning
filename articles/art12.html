Then 3,000 People Locked Inside.<br></h1><p id="artcont">On July 4, Australia’s second-largest city went into lockdown. But residents of nine public housing towers were singled out for even stricter treatment, leading many to suspect discrimination. By Besha Rodell and Christina Simons MELBOURNE, Australia — In the late afternoon of July 4, dozens of police vehicles pulled up at a public housing tower in Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city. It was, witnesses said, like a scene from an action movie — but instead of responding to a terrorist threat, the officers were responding to a coronavirus spike. Minutes earlier, Daniel Andrews, the premier of the state of Victoria, had announced expanded stay-at-home orders that would begin just before midnight. For one group, though, the lockdown would be immediate, and far more restrictive. Hence the sudden police presence at the north Melbourne tower and eight others, housing 3,000 people in all. While most Melbourne residents could leave their homes briefly to exercise and shop for necessities, the residents of the towers were effectively placed, without warning, under house arrest for up to 14 days. The authorities said the towers had “explosive potential” because of their population density, but the concentration of infections was not out of line with rates in other areas of the city, and private residential towers were not treated with similar alarm. To the public housing residents, many of them immigrants, it felt like discrimination. Complaints flooded the ombudsman in Victoria, who is conducting an investigation. Melbourne’s broader lockdown — one of the longest and strictest in the world — finally ended on Oct. 28 after 111 days. But while the rest of the city celebrates its freedom and what many see as a triumph over the virus, the residents of the towers are still contending with feelings of trauma, anger and confusion. Here are some of their stories. Ebyon Hassan, 32, was still foggy from a nap when she peered out the window after receiving a frantic phone call from her sister. “It was like a nightmare,” Ms. Hassan, who is originally from Somalia, said in an interview outside her building in early October. “There were so many cop cars; they had taken over the car parks. There were so many lights. And you think, ‘What have I done?’” Ms. Hassan’s father was out for his afternoon walk. He was healthy at the time, though prone to pneumonia. “So we had been very vigilant,” she said. Still, by July 7, three days after the lockdown began, he had tested positive. “No one came to check on him until the 16th,” Ms. Hassan said. He was given the option of leaving their apartment and being isolated elsewhere. But he kept thinking about his best friend, who had never returned after contracting the virus and being removed from his home. “My father was a very spiritual man, and so afraid of dying alone,” Ms. Hassan said. “He refused to go.” On July 23, a few days after the building’s strict 14-day lockdown lifted, Mr. Hassan finally agreed to go to the hospital. He died a week later. He was 62. Ms. Hassan is devastated by the loss of her father, but she is also reeling from a sense of betrayal at the way she and her community were treated. (Government officials declined requests for interviews.) “It looked like cages, like a prison,” she said. “We thought we were in a free country. Covid taught us that we aren’t free.” Almost immediately after the police arrived, Hiba Shanino, a 21-year-old legal practice student whose parents are from Eritrea, began to hear from people inside her building who were panicking.
