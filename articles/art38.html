I’m Frank Bruni. And this is “The Argument.” [THEME MUSIC] Protests against police brutality have been reignited after the shooting of Jacob Blake. And the Trump campaign sees an opportunity. As counter-protests turn lethal and the president continues to stoke division, what’s the political fallout of violence in American cities? How did it become a cudgel against Joe Biden and the Democrats and not an indictment of the man actually in charge? So guys, this is our Peaches & Herb moment. We’re reunited. And speaking for myself, it feels so good. I know, and for the last time. It’s wonderful to be back with you guys, even if Frank is poised to abandon us. And I really missed you guys, you know? Sure, I was sitting on a beach in Maine watching the time of the world go by, watching my children play. But really, I was thinking about arguing about politics the whole time. [LAUGHTER] You were looking at your lovely little children and thinking of Michelle and me, of course. Of course. I’m like, which one is more Frank, and which one is more Michelle? And my wife was like, what are you talking about? [LAUGHTER] So let’s get right into our topic this week because it is a big one. Almost two weeks ago, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, a 29-year-old Black man named Jacob Blake was shot at close range in the back by a white police officer in front of Blake’s three sons. Video of the shooting spread fast, instantly rekindling protests against police brutality. Two days into the protests, a 17-year-old, reportedly a Trump supporter, shot protesters in Kenosha, killing two people. Then, in Portland, Oregon, a caravan of Trump supporters were met with counter-protesters. And amid the skirmishes that broke out, a member of the far right group Patriot Prayer was shot and killed. Meanwhile, Trump eggs on this division with all the subtlety of a military parade. He tweets praise for his supporters, whom he calls patriots, and links the Black Lives Matter protests to violent anarchy and the cities’ failure to quell that unrest to the Democratic Party as a whole. So let’s start with a question we’ve asked before on this show. And that is, can we blame Trump for this escalation of violence between Americans? I don’t think there’s any question that Trump has incited white vigilantism, white supremacy. He has been egging on kind of violent thuggery from his supporters since his campaign in 2015 and 2016. He has repeatedly lauded people who either threaten or take violent action against those he considers his enemies. He just recently praised Kyle Rittenhouse, who has been charged with murder after shooting two protesters in Kenosha. And something I would point out is that this is an argument that I have been making for years and years now. It’s an argument that people like the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League has made. In my column this week, I talked to Elizabeth Neumann, who was part of Trump’s D.H.S. until April, where she was a high-level counterterrorism official. And she also makes this argument. She says that a huge problem that people working on counterterrorism in the United States have to deal with is the growing emboldening of white supremacy and violent white nationalism, and that Trump has both encouraged them, made them feel like they have his tacit encouragement, and handicapped government efforts to combat it. So there’s just no question at this point that Trump has emboldened the violent right. And then the other piece of that is that you’re seeing some of the protests against police brutality also give way to violence. I mean, obviously, the proximate cause of that is police brutality. But I also think part of it is that you’re starting to see left-wing people show up to these protests with guns, which I think is a direct response to the fact that so many right-wing people are showing up to these protests with guns. Ross, what’s your reaction to that? I mean, I’ve thought all along that Trump bears responsibility for the general mood in American politics. I think that under a different president, you would have less violence in the streets. I think Trump’s habit of sort of winking at white nationalist supporters in various ways probably does have some emboldening effect. I’m not sure it’s really the only place I’d lay the stress, though, right now, since we’re living through a wave of riots that’s probably the most serious in this country since LA, certainly in the early 1990s. And as Michelle says, the proximate cause of the riots is responses to police brutality. But I think it’s pretty clear that a mostly white, sort of anarchist fringe has fastened onto the protests and used them as a pretext for maintaining a simmering level of aggressive property crime and destruction in a few American cities over the last few months. And it’s a problem independent of Trump that those cities — Portland, Oregon being the main exampl e— haven’t figured out a way to get the violent side of those protests under control. And I think that it’s totally reasonable to have a conversation about this that isn’t just about Trump and is about what is the response if you’re the mayor of a liberal city right now, and your business districts are getting burned? What is your response if you’re the mayor of Kenosha, Wisconsin, and your business districts are getting burned? What’s the response if immigrant-owned small businesses are getting torched? And that can’t just be a conversation about how Trump is bad. I do think Trump is bad. There’s some other stuff going on here that’s mostly action happening on the left, I would say. Can I just interject? Because I actually— I mean, I agree with Ross to a certain extent that these questions about how Democratic mayors should be handling violent unrest is not just a rehash of the way that Trump has unleashed evil spirits in the United States. But I don’t think you can totally separate all of this and say we’re just living through a wave of urban riots and not violent white supremacy, or not right-wing incitement for a second civil war, when if you look at the fact that even some of the most shocking acts of violence to come out of the wave of urban unrest that’s followed George Floyd’s killing has been by the far right. It’s really, really telling that when Mike Pence needed an example of a really shocking killing that happened at one of these riots, he spoke about the murder of a federal officer named Dave Patrick Underwood in Oakland. And he made it seem as if this was an outgrowth of the Black Lives Matter protests. He didn’t mention that the person charged in this killing was part of the Boogaloo boys, which is this bizarre, extremely online sort of militia movement that wants to spark a second civil war. So I agree that there’s a conversation that’s kind of separate from the white nationalist conversation. But I don’t think you can take right-wing incitement, provocateurs out of the violence that’s happening all over this country right now. Ross, in terms of how Trump does or doesn’t fit into all of this, let me ask the question in a different way. If we had these police shootings under a different president, do you think we would see the aftermath playing out the way it is now? Not exactly. I mean, I think the reason the aftermath has played out the way it has is the pandemic, and the lockdowns, and the suspension of ordinary American life. I think that if you’d had the shootings and the protests in a situation where more people were at work, and at school, and cities were more normalized, you would have had some protests, maybe some days and nights of riots in a few places. But you wouldn’t have had both this sort of national movement aspect of it and the kind of sustained protest-cum-violent stuff that you’ve had in a few places. And obviously, Trump plays a role in how America responded to the pandemic and so on. But I think the weird suspension of normal life has played a bigger role in creating the overall culture here than necessarily Trump himself. What also might have played out differently is you might have different responses from blue state governors and liberal mayors to the situation because they wouldn’t be afraid of being seen as siding with Trump. I think there’s a certain kind of political pressure that having Trump as president brings to bear on liberals in government confronting rallies and protests, where doing anything that seems to feed into Trump’s narrative is something you can’t do. So you think they’re being less, for lack of a better adjective, stern with what’s going on in their cities because they want to distinguish themselves from Trump and sort of defy him? Yeah, I think there’s probably more hesitancy about whether it’s calling in the National Guard, which obviously has been done in a lot of places, or instituting curfews, or just being seen as condemning the violent fringe of the protest too harshly. I mean, we had that whole phase of the CHAZ Zone, the sort of separatist enclave in Seattle, where Trump was raging about it. So the mayor of Seattle, because Trump is ranting, feels compelled to go on Twitter and talk about how peaceful this all is and how it’s like we’re just hanging out and having another summer of love here in Seattle. And then eventually, lo and behold, some people get killed, and the CHAZ Zone has to shut down. And then in the aftermath, you get reporting, including in our newspaper, that says, actually, this was kind of a hellscape if you owned a business in this area, right? And I think that that kind of thing would have played out very differently under both a Democratic president and a non-ranting Republican president. So that’s, I think, a small case study. But I think you have similar case studies around the country. It would be easier for liberal mayors and governors to take both tougher measures and use tougher rhetoric if they weren’t afraid of being seen to give aid and comfort to Trump’s anti-B.L.M., anti-Antifa narrative. I should make sure our listeners are aware— we’re recording this on Tuesday morning. And I think that’s important because, later today, after we finish recording, Donald Trump is going to be in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He was asked, I think, by the governor and by others not to come. But that is not something that is ever going to deter our president. Michelle, at this point in time, with the election two months away, does Trump want this violence? Absolutely he wants it. There was a quote from Kellyanne Conway last week that Biden has repeated a bunch of times for obvious reasons because it was extremely telling and revealing. She said on Fox, “The more chaos, and anarchy, and vandalism, and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who’s best on public safety, and law and order.” You don’t invite this ridiculous, gun-waving, St. Louis couple to speak at the R.N.C. and say that protesters are going to invade the suburbs if you don’t think that this wave of violence is good for you. And I think that that is still a very open question, right? There has been a few hints that some of this might be working in Trump’s favor. But after the freak out that showed the polls tightening after the Republican convention. They’re now back about to where they were. There is a kind of a chicken-and-egg question about whether this works, right? Because I mean, it has been sort of insane to watch this 17-year-old kid, a Blue Lives Matter obsessive, someone who, according to BuzzFeed, was at a Trump rally in January, you know, takes his gun, drives to protest, kills two people, is charged with murder. And in the next couple of days, the media narrative is, is Kenosha terrible for Biden? How are the Democrats going to deal with this, right? And it’s sort of the soft bigotry of no expectations for Republicans, right? Nobody even expects Trump to gesture towards the middle. Nobody expects Trump to try to calm things down, whereas people do have these expectations of the Democrats. And so, although I think it’s unclear whether kind of sparking a second civil war in the United States is going to be a net positive for the incumbent president, I think that Trump thinks it is. And I think that’s what he’s trying to do. Do you agree with that, Ross? Or what do you think the political fallout of this is going to be? I mean, I think there is a sort of soft bigotry of no expectations around Trump in that we know what we get from Trump. We know that he is not capable of making certain politically obvious moves that a normal president would make in these circumstances. And of course, it would benefit Trump politically if he were more likely to condemn people to his right. We just are aware at this point that that’s not something he’s going to do. And so the focus is on the more unpredictable question of how does Joe Biden handle any of this. Kenosha became a subject of media debate, one, because it was a really severe wave of vandalism and arson that happened in a swing state, in a region that Trump has to win and that he won, to everyone’s surprise, last time, right? So it’s not just the riots. It’s the location of the riots and so on. It happened at a moment when you could see public opinions seeming to turn a bit in general surveys about protests and Black Lives Matter. And there was this initial surge of public support for the protests. And as time has gone on, and the Portland stuff has continued, and so on, that support has diminished somewhat. So there was sort of an intersection of another night of severe riots with that turn in public opinion. And then Rittenhouse himself is, as far as we can tell, not a white supremacist, not a Boogaloo boy, just an idiot, basically, who, at 17, decided to go and protect car dealerships from rioters and ended up shooting people in a context that was not him wading into a crowd firing. It was him basically getting his ass kicked, as far as anyone could tell. OK, but nonetheless, what do you make, Ross, about the fact that the right has turned Kyle Rittenhouse into a hero? Tucker Carlson has been raving positively about him on air. Ann Coulter said she wants Kyle Rittenhouse as her president, I guess thereby admitting that Donald Trump isn’t doing such a great job. Looking for the silver lining in that comment. Well, Ann Coulter has been arguing that Trump is doing a terrible job for a long time. She wants her wall. She wants her wall. She wants her wall. Right. And if you watch Tucker Carlson closely, the fact that he thinks Trump is a failure is a pretty strong subtext of his show night to night. OK, but let’s go back to Kyle. What do you make, Ross, about the fact that elements of the right, and Ann Coulter — And Trump. Tucker Carlson are there — yeah, and Trump himself, are lionizing this 17-year-old, who went with a gun into an inflammatory situation? Because the right thinks that the people in charge of American cities have essentially retreated and abdicated their responsibility to protect peoples, businesses from rioters. And so people are, as happened with Bernie Goetz, famously, in the 1980s, people are you know are celebrating this kid who, again, as far as I can tell, was an idiot who is culpable for people’s deaths, whether he’s guilty of murder or not. But they’re celebrating him for going and trying to effectively defend the things that the police weren’t defending. But that celebration is sick, no? Well, it’s dangerous, right? Because it’s going — it sends a message to other dumb — I mean, I don’t agree. Again, I think what Kyle Rittenhouse did was moronic at best, and people are dead because he, at best, was a moron. And I’m not celebrating it. I think that when you have an abdication of sort of civil authority to protect people’s property and sometimes lives, then you’re going to get a mood that’s sympathetic to vigilantism, yeah. I don’t think that’s remotely surprising. No, no, well, that’s not— granted, Ross, that’s not a celebration. That sounds a little bit to me like it’s at least in the zip code of a justification. I mean, I think that if Kyle Rittenhouse had not been a 17-year-old teenager from another state, but had been a small business owner, who was armed when people came into their business and started setting it on fire, then it would have been justified, yeah. Right. But that’s if it had been a totally different situation, right? [LAUGHING] Exactly. Exactly. Thank you, Michelle. Well, yeah, yes. But I’m saying that there is a reason that, in situations where people are going around burning businesses, that people get sympathetic to vigilantism. And it’s dumb to be sympathetic to the kind of vigilantism that Kyle Rittenhouse embodied. But just saying we can’t — it’s sick to celebrate vigilantism in a climate of people’s businesses being torched, then — I mean, people’s businesses getting torched is sick, right? Some of the people doing things in these riots, not just the people shooting cops and things like that, but people torching somebody’s livelihood, that’s sick too, right? Well, I don’t know. I mean, to me, it sounds like I could make the same argument, but I won’t, that, say, in a climate where police are shooting people and the government is not protecting them, then it makes sense that people will riot as — what is the Martin Luther King line? A riot is the voice of the unheard. I could construct a similar justification for rioting and looting, but I won’t do it. And it sounds like, to me, that’s what you’re doing, basically, kind of desperate times call for desperate measures. Why don’t we achieve consensus here and say that I will say that crossing state lines with a gun to try and interject yourself into a gravely chaotic situation, whatever mitigating circumstances there are, that is both a stupid and a wicked thing to do. It’s also wicked to burn somebody’s business, right? Oh, yes, of course. Of course. I think it’s less wicked to burn someone’s business than to kill someone. OK, is it less wicked to burn someone’s business than to take your gun and try and stand guard around someone’s business? What Kyle Rittenhouse intended to do, which was stand guard around someone’s car dealership that might have been torched, is that more wicked than torching a car dealership? Less wicked? Wash? What do you think? I think it’s more dangerous. But beyond these gradations, which, to me, are almost getting a little silly, is when you enter a situation like that, when you walk into a room that is strewn with fuel with a match, bad things are going to happen. I mean, this is a volatile situation that your presence is going to do nothing but render more volatile. But the reason I dwelled on it, Ross, is — No, but look. But Frank, the conservative — the thing that you’re reacting to so strongly from conservatives here is rooted in the fact that you’re describing the burning building in these sort of abstract terms like it’s a situation, or there’s things on fire. But in fact, people are setting those fires. People are torching those businesses. People are performing actions that are wrong. No, and it is — I mean, it’s striking to me to listen — Ross, the degree of emotion that I can tell you feel about this, where, to me, it is kind of bad. I feel immensely sorry for some of these small business owners who are not implicated in police violence. But it doesn’t bring up the same emotion in me as seeing police shoot unarmed civilians or police — OK, but the police shooting unarmed civilians is obviously worse than burning a building. But we’re having an argument about the idiot kid who tries to protect the car dealership, right? No, I’m actually trying not to have an argument — I’m trying not to have an argument about the kid. I’m trying to have an argument, or not even an argument, about the disparate reactions to what’s going on. So I started— we went down this Kyle Rittenhouse rabbit hole when I was asking why people on the right were celebrating him, were lionizing, were going well beyond justifying him, including the president, right? And earlier, you made a reference, Ross, to will Joe Biden condemn certain actions on the left? Well, he has now in Pittsburgh yesterday. We’re recording on Tuesday. In Pittsburgh on Monday, he said, these protests that get out of hand, the sooner — we have — what I’m focused on here is the real imbalance between what Joe Biden has said and will say and I think will continue to say and what Donald Trump won’t say and isn’t saying. And it’s not just Donald Trump. This has spread throughout the Republican Party. There was a fascinating interview on Sunday that Dana Bash of CNN did with Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin, where she asked him if he would condemn the violence. And he kept dancing around the words because he was clearly so worried that if he seemed to be condemning Kyle Rittenhouse and people who’d run to those burning stores that you’re talking about, Ross, that he would somehow alienate his political constituency. I just think that’s weird, dangerous, and unhealthy. My strong impression is that we have passed through a months-long period in which Democratic politicians and much of the mainstream press have wanted to insist that riots have not been as bad as riots have actually been because they are supportive of the cause of the protests that the riots have been attached to. That’s my impression of the story of the last few months. I will grant you, Ross, the riots have been horrible. And I think sometimes, there’s a big element of truth to what you’re saying. And part of the challenge right now for Joe Biden is, I think, a lot of people feel that they’re not hearing a stern enough condemnation, that people are not admitting fully that people gave protesters too much of a pass in terms of gathering amid a pandemic and all of that. Well, I don’t think that’s. That’s a separate issue. I would like some empirical understanding of how bad the riots have been versus how bad they’ve been presented in the mainstream media. Because my impression, being back here in New York City, is that there’s this presentation of New York and other urban areas as this sort of crime-ridden hellscape, when, in reality, being back in New York, I wouldn’t really know any of this was going on if I didn’t see it on television or on the internet. It’s much more contained, at least here, than you would understand from reading mainstream newspapers, from watching cable news, from looking at it on the internet. I feel like I hear similar things from people in Portland, who will say, you know, there’s this idea that the city is on fire. But if you’re out of a few-block radius, you’re barely even aware of it. And so it’s just not clear to me that the scope of the riots has been underplayed. I think the scope of the riots have now been overplayed on the right. But I think that in our world of media, I think there was a period of a couple months when the scale of the damage in places like Minneapolis, especially, was underplayed. And also, there was a spasm of looting in Chicago a few weeks ago. And it was bad enough that they raised the bridges around Chicago to try and keep people from entering or leaving downtown in order to contain it. And it got only coverage, as far as I can tell, from local media and right-wing media. And you know, I cited the example of the CHAZ stuff in Seattle. I think what was — everything that was wrong there got a lot more coverage after the fact, after it had been shut down. I guess all I’m saying is that I think — not to be all both sides here. But I think both sides are engaged in a kind of dangerous denial of parts of reality. So can I say something to that? I mean, I do think that left-wing social media has had a really deleterious effect in that there is such stigma in seeming to call out, quote-unquote, “bad protesters” or make distinctions between good and bad protesters, or say commonsense things about the political impact of unrest. If you look at the firing of David Shor, which is something that maybe took up more oxygen in some of these debates than you would think the firing of a data analyst would usually receive. And it was because this data analyst for a progressive consulting firm, who was fired from tweeting out a study by a Black Princeton professor about how riots in 1968 helped boost Richard Nixon’s vote share. So I think this bleeds over a little bit. And Democratic politicians, to the extent that they are too online, might be hampered in making what seem like commonsense points to a lot of their constituents. But at the same time, I don’t buy the idea that this stuff has not been widely covered. There’s also an element of just journalists — there are — some of our very brave colleagues are traveling and are reporting and kind of risking their health to do it. But I think fewer people are doing it than would have done in the past because of the pandemic. So there’s a bit of a fog of war element to try and figure out what is going on in CHAZ. But the reason that we know how bad CHAZ got is because of a big story in “The New York Times.” I think there’s truth to that. I also, though, think that there has been a lot — precisely because Donald Trump keeps talking about Antifa, there has been a lot of pressure to say like, oh Antifa, that just means people who are against fascism, or Antifa, that doesn’t really exist, or it only exists in Tom Cotton’s fervent imagination. But it doesn’t exist in the way that they talk about it as like — you hear Laura Logan talking about how they’re getting marching orders. And there’s this rumor that Donald Trump spread of black-clad people on an airplane. I mean, I know these people. I’ve reported on these people enough to know that, yeah, you have kind of black bloc idiots in every single metropolitan area in the country who are always trying to hijack protests and break shit. And that’s something that precedes this current moment. There’s overlap but also a distinction between the black bloc and Antifa, if we really want to go down that road. They’re not entirely the same thing. But there has been this attempt to basically turn kind of black bloc idiots into a well-organized terrorist threat. That’s ridiculous. I think it’s wrong to see them as a well-organized terrorist threat. I think, as someone who’s spent much of the last three years in arguments with people on my right, saying, look, you Antifa, this is not really a real thing. This is just a bunch of idiots cosplaying. I think we’ve established that those people are capable of doing substantial amounts of property damage and creating extremely dangerous environments in American cities, when given the opportunity afforded by a pandemic, Donald Trump, and mass protests. I would say that I underestimated the capacities of those idiots to sustain arson, damage, looting, and violence over a multi-month period. I think they’ve done a fairly impressive job in a lot of American cities of doing that. And that doesn’t make them the next ISIS. It doesn’t make them an existential threat to the US. It doesn’t make Donald Trump right in his fantasies about black-clad Antifa ninjas on a plane. But it’s still kind of a big story, right? I don’t know. I think it’s really unclear. Look, there’s clearly these kids who’ve been dreaming of— I don’t know — some sort of overthrow of the system for their whole lives and think that this is their big shot. And you kind of burn down enough coffee shops, and the next thing you know, you have the end of capitalism. [LAUGHTER] But it’s very unclear— Which is true. I mean, we should concede that that’s true. There is a moment at which capitalism will end. But it’s very unclear to me how much of this is Antifa, how much of it is just opportunists that see looting going on and want in on it, how much of it is other sorts of protesters. And then there is — I think that people on the left can overplay the role of right-wing provocateurs, but they’re also part of the mix. If you want to talk about what happened in Minneapolis, there was that black-clad guy that really kicked off a lot of the arson and property damage. And you obviously can’t blame him for all of it. But I think people can look back and say that’s when it started. And we do now know, or at least he’s been arrested and charged as being a white supremacist provocateur. So I think that there is still a fair degree of confusion about the precise makeup and the precise breakdown of responsibility for what’s happening right now. [MUSIC PLAYING] Let’s take a quick break, and we’ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] And we’re back. So the election is exactly two months away. And this issue, clearly, is going to linger throughout it. Michelle, you said earlier you think Trump wants this violence. Do you think, at the end of the day, it is going to help him on November 3, or I should say, beforehand as well, since a lot of the voting this year is going to be mail-in? I mean, I should say that because I am so terrified of what’s going to happen, I fear in my darkest moments that it will. I don’t see how you can experience the 2016 election and not think that white backlash is an incredibly powerful force in American politics. But I think that might be more my emotions talking than anything empirical. There was one poll that showed some tightening. There’s been some anecdotal reporting, including in our newspaper. But overall, the polls are really, really stable. In the 1968 analogy, Donald Trump is not Richard Nixon. He’s L.B.J., right, in that it’s kind of hard to make the case that you need to re-elect me president to stop the violence and chaos that has happened while I’m president. Ross, what do you think the political fallout of this is going to be? How do you see this coloring the presidential race? I mean, so I wrote a column weeks ago now, where I tried to imagine how Trump could possibly come back. This was when Biden was up by an average of 10, I think, in a lot of polls. And the scenario I spun out was basically that Trump needed COVID infections to drop dramatically, that he needed some of the early herd immunity theories to be true. And he probably needed the violent fringe of the protests to become much more salient going into the election. A very mild version of that is happening. COVID infection rates have fallen, not as far as we would like them, but they have fallen. And the violent fringe of the protests has gotten somewhat more salient. I think it’s understandable that liberals would be worried. And I think it’s reasonable to worry in the sense that— the incumbency point that Michelle makes is, I think, partially right. But there is another reality, which actually, David Shor, the data analyst Michelle mentioned in the first segment, who was fired, famously, for some of his tweeting about the politics of riots, he makes this argument about issues salience, that voters, for better or worse, trust one party more than the other on a particular issue. And so if you raise the salience of that issue, who’s got the policies that technically poll best might be less important than just the fact that the issue is salient. So if you raise the issue salience of health care, the policy details may not matter as much as the fact that voters tend to trust Democrats more on health care. If that issue becomes more salient, it’s good for the Democrats. And so if voters trust Republicans more on fighting crime and controlling urban riots, then even if Donald Trump doesn’t have a 10-point plan to stop the urban riots, the more you raise the salience of that issue, the more potential advantages Republicans have. So that, I think, is one way of arguing that what’s happened in the last few weeks around these issues should make Democrats worried. That being said, Trump is not— I mean, we were saying this in the first segment. But Trump is running against Joe Biden. Joe Biden is a famously moderate Democrat with a tough-on-crime past who’s, to put it charitably, a little bit past his prime as a political communicator, but still is perfectly capable of giving a speech where he says, riots are bad, right? And Trump is not really capable of sustaining a Richard-Nixon-type, claiming-the-center strategy. And to the extent that that’s the basic political reality of the race, I think things would need to get a lot better with the coronavirus and a lot worse with the riots before full Democratic panic would be justified. So you said Biden is perfectly capable of giving a speech decrying the violence. He gave that speech on Monday in Pittsburgh. Michelle, did you think he accomplished what he needed to? Do you think that speech was on the mark? Yeah, I mean, it’s a difficult thing for me to evaluate because there’s sort of like what I want Biden to do because I think it will help him win versus what I believe. So what I believe is that the real problem here is police violence. And that is what you have to tackle first. Do I believe that it is good for Biden to decry these riots and to show wavering suburbanites that he cares about urban unrest and that he’s going to keep them safe, even though I believe that they are already 100 percent safe from this phenomenon? Yes, I do. So to me, the speech was great. And I thought it was great also because it opened up the obvious question. Yes, I condemn violence. I condemn left-wing extremism. Your turn. Why won’t you do it? If we just had a whole news cycle about is this bad for Biden, why won’t Biden condemn the riots, will he condemn them strongly enough — it’s frustrating that it seems unlikely that we’re not going to have a similar news cycle about Trump, again, because nobody expects anything of him. Except that the news cycle is always about how Trump is bad. Why won’t Biden do this thing that he needs to do to make sure this bad man is beaten? I mean, that’s the dynamic, at least of CNN. It’s not the dynamic everywhere. But it’s a pretty common media dynamic. And Trump does get— after Charlottesville that Trump had some of his worst polling numbers. When Trump is seen as not condemning right-wing extremists, white supremacists, and so on, it shows up in the polls. And the Trump campaign — other people have made this point, maybe Josh Barro or somebody. But they keep setting up really easy tests for Joe Biden to pass. They’re like, oh, Joe Biden, he won’t leave his basement. He can’t speak. He just mumbles. And then he gives a normal, pretty good convention speech. And it’s like, OK, pass that test. And then they’re like, well, Joe Biden won’t condemn the riots. And so Joe Biden gives a speech condemning the riots. And now, the bar will be Joe Biden won’t specifically condemn Antifa. And as you can tell from the first segment, I think Joe Biden should specifically condemn Antifa. Think he could go further in his specific attacks to the left. But I think if that seems politically necessary, he obviously will do that. He did something else really smart, I think, in his remarks on Monday. And I think he said it several times. It was simple. But he certainly said it once loud and clear. And like I said, I think multiple times, where he kind of said to voters, you know me. You know me. And that was bigger than just about the violence and whether he condemns the violence. Obviously, whether they’re trying to pin him into a corner by being not sufficiently condemning of the violence, whether they’re trying to do it in other ways, they’re saying that— Trump and his surrogates and his enablers, they’re all saying that Joe Biden is a hostage of the left or will be a hostage of the left. And I just think it’s very effective when he speaks plainly and simply and trades on what is his greatest strength, which is that he has been around a long time, and he is not scary to Middle America. And I just really, really, I thought, was smart, and it really kind of rang out when he said, I believe multiple times, in his remarks to voters, you know me. Well, and he said, do I look like a radical socialist to you? Like, come on. Yeah, I think that’s an effective line. I mean, I don’t want to — I think there was a little bit of over-praising the Biden speech maybe from journalists who were panicked by a few of those post-convention polls. And Biden has lost a step. That’s just not really disputable. He is not as vigorous a politician as he was eight or 10 years ago. And that’s a weakness. And he sort of wanders verbally more than he used to. He’s not a dynamic presidential candidate at all. But that’s probably OK for the kind of race he’s trying to win. It may actually be to his advantage, given how exhausting Donald Trump is to most Americans. I don’t know. I worry about it a lot. The Democrats haven’t won with a candidate over 55 in a really long time. You know, LBJ seems like an ancient person, but he was, I think, 55 when he became president. We don’t have a great record of, in either party, electing kind of old Senate warhorses. And I don’t know. It definitely scares me. I mean, it’s why I didn’t want him to be the nominee, even though I now think he has some strengths. But wait a second, Michelle. You wanted Elizabeth Warren, and she’s 71 now. So — But she’s a vigorous 71, Frank. I mean, she is. She’s more vigorous. OK, I will admit she’s a much more vigorous 71 than Joe is at 77. But I mean, she breaks that paradigm of Democrats winning with the youngest candidate. I’m just— Yeah, but, you know, 71 in woman years. Fair enough. Fair enough. You know. [LAUGHS] I mean, but I think that is what Michelle is saying is that the danger for Biden is that he doesn’t turn out young voters at quite the rates that a more — either a more dynamic or more left-wing candidate would have, and that his age and wobbliness becomes a problem in the event that, if there were sustained rioting and the politics of law and order just stay incredibly salient in states like Wisconsin and Minnesota, then the Democratic candidate needs to — he needs to project some toughness, some sense that if it’s necessary to sort of bang heads — again, not of criminals, but of mayors, of going after his own governors or his own mayors and so on, that he can do that. And a little more 1980s Biden would probably be better for this campaign. Is one of the dangers for Biden us? And by that, I mean the media. And what I’m talking about is I kind of notice in this most recent thing with urban — with the violence and the protests as a good example. You know, Donald Trump spotlights an issue, takes some position on it, says something provocative. And the media immediately begins writing, how is Joe Biden going to respond? And I see a lot of people making the correct comment that Biden isn’t controlling or seizing the narrative. But I’m not sure we allow him to. I feel like, for all of our hand-wringing and soul searching and self-examination about the way we covered Trump, I still think we let him define the event of a given 24, 72-hour news cycle. And then it becomes how will Joe Biden respond. And I’m not sure how Biden breaks out of that if, in fact, it’s a pattern that we’ve established. Michelle, am I seeing— are you seeing this too? Or— I think that’s right. I mean, and again, I think there’s a bit of a chicken and an egg thing, like I said before, where it’s hard to say, is the media responding to a genuine shift in the electorate or the polling? Or is the media creating a narrative because it’s sort of that time in the race when you need a new story besides Biden is inevitable and Trump is self destructing. But I definitely do think that — again, the media, I think it both sort of follows Trump’s lead on defining the issues and then lets him off the hook so that there’s not a — you don’t see a lot of reporting. And I do think that Ross is right in that, because I think a lot of journalists do fear for the republic, so they’re not sort of worried about what Trump is doing wrong. There’s not a sense of what does Trump have to do to right the ship. That piece Jamelle wrote is the kind of piece that you see about Biden all the time and you basically never see about Trump. You never see people sort of suggesting that Trump might be losing the center. You never see people dwelling on Trump’s refusal to disavow the far right. And so I do think that there is a little bit of chronic both-sidesing that I think was a big, big problem for Hillary Clinton. I think that the media vastly inflated the salience of email server management as an issue. And I think voters took a cue from that, that this is a really big deal. And I think that they could be doing the same thing over again. Yeah, well, but it’s different, right? Biden is not — there’s a lot of coverage of, is Biden doing enough to win? Is Biden going to blow it and so on? There’s very little critical scrutiny of Biden’s actual record. I mean, we’re not getting a range of stories that are — the stories that liberals feared we’d get, that are like, well, what about the Biden family’s overseas business dealings? I mean, there was a bunch of stories about Biden not being left enough during the primary campaign. But there’s — I don’t know. I mean, I feel like there’s very little, let’s say, of the media echoing the Trump campaign’s narrative about Biden, right? The Trump campaign’s narrative about Biden is that he is an embodiment of a failed American establishment that outsourced American jobs overseas and led us into disastrous wars in the Middle East. And that’s kind of true. [LAUGHS] But nobody in the media is echoing that line. Nobody in the media is re-excavating Biden’s Iraq war vote or things like that in the way that the media did, I think, play into Trump’s “crooked Hillary” narrative in 2016. I think all of the Biden stuff is about — right now, at least, we’ve still got a little ways to go — is just about is he doing enough. And they aren’t trying to like grab the narrative with huge policy speeches and big ideas. I mean, I don’t know if you can completely blame the media for what is, in fact, choices that the Biden campaign is making, which is to run a — it’s a very cautious, front-porch-style campaign. I mean, Biden’s convention speech was— I mean, it was actually really distinctive. It was really short. It had almost no policy in it. It was just a personal appeal. Like I’m Joe Biden. You know who I am. I’m a good guy. Donald Trump’s terrible. He’s messed up the coronavirus. Vote for me. That’s the Biden strategy. And it is vulnerable, but it’s vulnerable to external events like the coronavirus diminishing and riots getting worse. No, but that’s an excellent point. It’s impossible to seize the narrative if, in fact, you’re protecting a lead. And that has been the Biden strategy. It factors into why Kamala Harris was the vice-presidential choice. I think there has been an assumption that he’s ahead, that if you just kind of extrapolate forward far enough, he ends up ahead, he ends up winning. And let’s not do anything wrong. Let’s not take any big risks. Let’s protect our lead. I think that’s a big part of the dynamic. And I think that’s what you’re referring to Ross, right? Yeah. And he does — well, and the other little thing is that, because there’s an assumption that Trump can win the electoral college even if he loses the popular vote by 2 or 3 points, there’s also a weird uncertainty in the media narrative about how much is Biden really winning by. If he is up by 8 points, that’s huge by modern presidential campaign standards. On the other hand, it’s only a 5-point lead from an electoral college point of view. So there’s a certain kind of whip sawing and uncertainty in the media narrative there, too, I think. And the media is, once again, despite its promises every four years not to do so, covering the horse race more than anything else. Here we are talking about polling margins and all of that. I’m raising my hand and saying, guilty as charged, you know? No, but I don’t think there’s anything to be guilty of. I mean, we’re talking about is there going to be a recognizable American republic three months from now. The question of kind of who’s ahead and who’s behind in that existential contest is a big one and it’s actually way more important than anything in Biden’s policy platform. Without necessarily agreeing with that argument, [BRUNI LAUGHS] I will say that it’s also true that Trump is not rolling out policy ideas regularly either. I mean, there is nothing but — with Biden running a cautious, low-policy campaign, and Trump running a scattershot, demagogic, low-policy campaign — I mean, in 2016, Trump had more policy. He had an actual sort of critique of the neoliberal establishment that was really important to his closing argument in 2016. And that sort of resurfaced in the Republican convention. But it’s not really there. Trump’s not really running on policy. So what else does the media have to write about except the horse race? Well, this is a great place to end because it’s not often that all three of us are in perfect alignment, and on the fact that this is not a policy election, I think we have total, total agreement, right? Yes, absolutely. And I guess agreement is also a good place to end your wonderful stint as part of our show here, Frank. And we will miss you terribly. But since this is your final “Argument” episode, we, of course, have to turn to you for the recommendation. So what will you give us as a parting gift as you say goodbye? Well, since it’s my last recommendation ever, at least on the show — I hope I have recommendations in my life. [LAUGHS] You’re going to do your own podcast that’s just recommendations. I have, over the last five years, become this strange and stubborn evangelist for the short story that is one of my favorite short stories ever called “In the Cemetery Where Al Jolson is Buried.” Has either of you ever read it? No. No. It’s by the famed, accomplished, terrific short story writer, Amy Hempel. It’s title does not prepare you for what it’s about. It’s basically about a woman watching a friend die. And yet it manages to be jovial to the point of jocular until the final paragraphs. And it is the story that just does this amazing thing, where you’re kind of rolling along with it. You’re feeling little pinpricks of grief and sorrow. And then in the last couple of sentences, it just tears your heart straight out of your chest. Now, you’re thinking, why am I recommending this? I’m one of those people who, when I’m feeling a little blue, I like to take the feeling all the way down until it comes back over the top. I get a glass of wine. I listen to Billie Holiday. And I read “In the Cemetery Where Al Jolson is Buried” by Amy Hempel. If you Google it, you will find the entire story online. And you can read it without buying anything. When I read it that way, I did not own any Amy Hempel book. I felt like I owed her for the intense pleasure. And so my recommendation is read the story online. And if you’re as taken with it as I am, reward Amy Hempel, and do the right thing by buying a copy of “The Collected Stories of Amy Hempel,” in which there are many, many other gems. But the peak, the Everest is “In the Cemetery Where Al Jolson is Buried.” I’m also a wallower, so I’ll do that. You’ll love this. And Frank, I guess, bringing us all the way down to the bottom so we can come back up is a good metaphor or synecdoche or some literary form for how you’re departing our show. [LAUGHTER] So— Or I was actually going to say for the Trump years. He’s bringing all the way to the bottom so we can come back up the top. Yeah! Well, we’ll save that for — The worse the better. We’ll save that for December. But Frank, thank you again for being with us over these totally insane months. And we will miss you terribly. Yes, thank you, Frank. Thank you guys. I’ll miss you. And I’ll miss the listeners for “The Argument.” I thank them for bearing with me. And may the road always rise to meet your feet and, you know, the rest of an Irish proverb. [LAUGHTER] I’m on the road, Ross. I’m on the road. [THEME MUSIC] Now, just one more thing before we go this week. We’re going to start releasing this podcast on Fridays rather than on Thursdays in an effort to catch more of the week’s news as the election heats up. So starting next week, we’ll be talking to you and arguing with each other on Fridays instead. And with that, that’s our show this week. Thank you for listening. The team includes Phoebe Lett, Vishakha Darbha, Kristin Lin, Isaac Jones, and Paula Szuchman. Special thanks to Kathy Tu. “The Argument” will be back in your feed next Friday. Wait, what are peaches and herbs? Oh, Ross. Oh, Ross! Peaches & Herb, it’s an R&B duo that did the song “Reunited,” which is a prom staple. Oh, man. You obviously never went — you didn’t go to your prom, did you? I didn’t. We’re really going to excavate some pretty some pretty dark territory here if we go down that road. [LAUGHTER] TRANSCRIPT I’m Michelle Goldberg. I’m Ross Douthat. I’m Frank Bruni. And this is “The Argument.” [THEME MUSIC] Protests against police brutality have been reignited after the shooting of Jacob Blake. And the Trump campaign sees an opportunity. As counter-protests turn lethal and the president continues to stoke division, what’s the political fallout of violence in American cities? How did it become a cudgel against Joe Biden and the Democrats and not an indictment of the man actually in charge? So guys, this is our Peaches & Herb moment. We’re reunited. And speaking for myself, it feels so good. I know, and for the last time. It’s wonderful to be back with you guys, even if Frank is poised to abandon us. And I really missed you guys, you know? Sure, I was sitting on a beach in Maine watching the time of the world go by, watching my children play. But really, I was thinking about arguing about politics the whole time. [LAUGHTER] You were looking at your lovely little children and thinking of Michelle and me, of course. Of course. I’m like, which one is more Frank, and which one is more Michelle? And my wife was like, what are you talking about? [LAUGHTER] So let’s get right into our topic this week because it is a big one. Almost two weeks ago, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, a 29-year-old Black man named Jacob Blake was shot at close range in the back by a white police officer in front of Blake’s three sons. Video of the shooting spread fast, instantly rekindling protests against police brutality. Two days into the protests, a 17-year-old, reportedly a Trump supporter, shot protesters in Kenosha, killing two people. Then, in Portland, Oregon, a caravan of Trump supporters were met with counter-protesters. And amid the skirmishes that broke out, a member of the far right group Patriot Prayer was shot and killed. Meanwhile, Trump eggs on this division with all the subtlety of a military parade. He tweets praise for his supporters, whom he calls patriots, and links the Black Lives Matter protests to violent anarchy and the cities’ failure to quell that unrest to the Democratic Party as a whole. So let’s start with a question we’ve asked before on this show. And that is, can we blame Trump for this escalation of violence between Americans? I don’t think there’s any question that Trump has incited white vigilantism, white supremacy. He has been egging on kind of violent thuggery from his supporters since his campaign in 2015 and 2016. He has repeatedly lauded people who either threaten or take violent action against those he considers his enemies. He just recently praised Kyle Rittenhouse, who has been charged with murder after shooting two protesters in Kenosha. And something I would point out is that this is an argument that I have been making for years and years now. It’s an argument that people like the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League has made. In my column this week, I talked to Elizabeth Neumann, who was part of Trump’s D.H.S. until April, where she was a high-level counterterrorism official. And she also makes this argument. She says that a huge problem that people working on counterterrorism in the United States have to deal with is the growing emboldening of white supremacy and violent white nationalism, and that Trump has both encouraged them, made them feel like they have his tacit encouragement, and handicapped government efforts to combat it. So there’s just no question at this point that Trump has emboldened the violent right. And then the other piece of that is that you’re seeing some of the protests against police brutality also give way to violence. I mean, obviously, the proximate cause of that is police brutality. But I also think part of it is that you’re starting to see left-wing people show up to these protests with guns, which I think is a direct response to the fact that so many right-wing people are showing up to these protests with guns. Ross, what’s your reaction to that? I mean, I’ve thought all along that Trump bears responsibility for the general mood in American politics. I think that under a different president, you would have less violence in the streets. I think Trump’s habit of sort of winking at white nationalist supporters in various ways probably does have some emboldening effect. I’m not sure it’s really the only place I’d lay the stress, though, right now, since we’re living through a wave of riots that’s probably the most serious in this country since LA, certainly in the early 1990s. And as Michelle says, the proximate cause of the riots is responses to police brutality. But I think it’s pretty clear that a mostly white, sort of anarchist fringe has fastened onto the protests and used them as a pretext for maintaining a simmering level of aggressive property crime and destruction in a few American cities over the last few months. And it’s a problem independent of Trump that those cities — Portland, Oregon being the main exampl e— haven’t figured out a way to get the violent side of those protests under control. And I think that it’s totally reasonable to have a conversation about this that isn’t just about Trump and is about what is the response if you’re the mayor of a liberal city right now, and your business districts are getting burned? What is your response if you’re the mayor of Kenosha, Wisconsin, and your business districts are getting burned? What’s the response if immigrant-owned small businesses are getting torched? And that can’t just be a conversation about how Trump is bad. I do think Trump is bad. There’s some other stuff going on here that’s mostly action happening on the left, I would say. Can I just interject? Because I actually— I mean, I agree with Ross to a certain extent that these questions about how Democratic mayors should be handling violent unrest is not just a rehash of the way that Trump has unleashed evil spirits in the United States. But I don’t think you can totally separate all of this and say we’re just living through a wave of urban riots and not violent white supremacy, or not right-wing incitement for a second civil war, when if you look at the fact that even some of the most shocking acts of violence to come out of the wave of urban unrest that’s followed George Floyd’s killing has been by the far right. It’s really, really telling that when Mike Pence needed an example of a really shocking killing that happened at one of these riots, he spoke about the murder of a federal officer named Dave Patrick Underwood in Oakland. And he made it seem as if this was an outgrowth of the Black Lives Matter protests. He didn’t mention that the person charged in this killing was part of the Boogaloo boys, which is this bizarre, extremely online sort of militia movement that wants to spark a second civil war. So I agree that there’s a conversation that’s kind of separate from the white nationalist conversation. But I don’t think you can take right-wing incitement, provocateurs out of the violence that’s happening all over this country right now. Ross, in terms of how Trump does or doesn’t fit into all of this, let me ask the question in a different way. If we had these police shootings under a different president, do you think we would see the aftermath playing out the way it is now? Not exactly. I mean, I think the reason the aftermath has played out the way it has is the pandemic, and the lockdowns, and the suspension of ordinary American life. I think that if you’d had the shootings and the protests in a situation where more people were at work, and at school, and cities were more normalized, you would have had some protests, maybe some days and nights of riots in a few places. But you wouldn’t have had both this sort of national movement aspect of it and the kind of sustained protest-cum-violent stuff that you’ve had in a few places. And obviously, Trump plays a role in how America responded to the pandemic and so on. But I think the weird suspension of normal life has played a bigger role in creating the overall culture here than necessarily Trump himself. What also might have played out differently is you might have different responses from blue state governors and liberal mayors to the situation because they wouldn’t be afraid of being seen as siding with Trump. I think there’s a certain kind of political pressure that having Trump as president brings to bear on liberals in government confronting rallies and protests, where doing anything that seems to feed into Trump’s narrative is something you can’t do. So you think they’re being less, for lack of a better adjective, stern with what’s going on in their cities because they want to distinguish themselves from Trump and sort of defy him? Yeah, I think there’s probably more hesitancy about whether it’s calling in the National Guard, which obviously has been done in a lot of places, or instituting curfews, or just being seen as condemning the violent fringe of the protest too harshly. I mean, we had that whole phase of the CHAZ Zone, the sort of separatist enclave in Seattle, where Trump was raging about it. So the mayor of Seattle, because Trump is ranting, feels compelled to go on Twitter and talk about how peaceful this all is and how it’s like we’re just hanging out and having another summer of love here in Seattle. And then eventually, lo and behold, some people get killed, and the CHAZ Zone has to shut down. And then in the aftermath, you get reporting, including in our newspaper, that says, actually, this was kind of a hellscape if you owned a business in this area, right? And I think that that kind of thing would have played out very differently under both a Democratic president and a non-ranting Republican president. So that’s, I think, a small case study. But I think you have similar case studies around the country. It would be easier for liberal mayors and governors to take both tougher measures and use tougher rhetoric if they weren’t afraid of being seen to give aid and comfort to Trump’s anti-B.L.M., anti-Antifa narrative. I should make sure our listeners are aware— we’re recording this on Tuesday morning. And I think that’s important because, later today, after we finish recording, Donald Trump is going to be in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He was asked, I think, by the governor and by others not to come. But that is not something that is ever going to deter our president. Michelle, at this point in time, with the election two months away, does Trump want this violence? Absolutely he wants it. There was a quote from Kellyanne Conway last week that Biden has repeated a bunch of times for obvious reasons because it was extremely telling and revealing. She said on Fox, “The more chaos, and anarchy, and vandalism, and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who’s best on public safety, and law and order.” You don’t invite this ridiculous, gun-waving, St. Louis couple to speak at the R.N.C. and say that protesters are going to invade the suburbs if you don’t think that this wave of violence is good for you. And I think that that is still a very open question, right? There has been a few hints that some of this might be working in Trump’s favor. But after the freak out that showed the polls tightening after the Republican convention. They’re now back about to where they were. There is a kind of a chicken-and-egg question about whether this works, right? Because I mean, it has been sort of insane to watch this 17-year-old kid, a Blue Lives Matter obsessive, someone who, according to BuzzFeed, was at a Trump rally in January, you know, takes his gun, drives to protest, kills two people, is charged with murder. And in the next couple of days, the media narrative is, is Kenosha terrible for Biden? How are the Democrats going to deal with this, right? And it’s sort of the soft bigotry of no expectations for Republicans, right? Nobody even expects Trump to gesture towards the middle. Nobody expects Trump to try to calm things down, whereas people do have these expectations of the Democrats. And so, although I think it’s unclear whether kind of sparking a second civil war in the United States is going to be a net positive for the incumbent president, I think that Trump thinks it is. And I think that’s what he’s trying to do. Do you agree with that, Ross? Or what do you think the political fallout of this is going to be? I mean, I think there is a sort of soft bigotry of no expectations around Trump in that we know what we get from Trump. We know that he is not capable of making certain politically obvious moves that a normal president would make in these circumstances. And of course, it would benefit Trump politically if he were more likely to condemn people to his right. We just are aware at this point that that’s not something he’s going to do. And so the focus is on the more unpredictable question of how does Joe Biden handle any of this. Kenosha became a subject of media debate, one, because it was a really severe wave of vandalism and arson that happened in a swing state, in a region that Trump has to win and that he won, to everyone’s surprise, last time, right? So it’s not just the riots. It’s the location of the riots and so on. It happened at a moment when you could see public opinions seeming to turn a bit in general surveys about protests and Black Lives Matter. And there was this initial surge of public support for the protests. And as time has gone on, and the Portland stuff has continued, and so on, that support has diminished somewhat. So there was sort of an intersection of another night of severe riots with that turn in public opinion. And then Rittenhouse himself is, as far as we can tell, not a white supremacist, not a Boogaloo boy, just an idiot, basically, who, at 17, decided to go and protect car dealerships from rioters and ended up shooting people in a context that was not him wading into a crowd firing. It was him basically getting his ass kicked, as far as anyone could tell. OK, but nonetheless, what do you make, Ross, about the fact that the right has turned Kyle Rittenhouse into a hero? Tucker Carlson has been raving positively about him on air. Ann Coulter said she wants Kyle Rittenhouse as her president, I guess thereby admitting that Donald Trump isn’t doing such a great job. Looking for the silver lining in that comment. Well, Ann Coulter has been arguing that Trump is doing a terrible job for a long time. She wants her wall. She wants her wall. She wants her wall. Right. And if you watch Tucker Carlson closely, the fact that he thinks Trump is a failure is a pretty strong subtext of his show night to night. OK, but let’s go back to Kyle. What do you make, Ross, about the fact that elements of the right, and Ann Coulter — And Trump. Tucker Carlson are there — yeah, and Trump himself, are lionizing this 17-year-old, who went with a gun into an inflammatory situation? Because the right thinks that the people in charge of American cities have essentially retreated and abdicated their responsibility to protect peoples, businesses from rioters. And so people are, as happened with Bernie Goetz, famously, in the 1980s, people are you know are celebrating this kid who, again, as far as I can tell, was an idiot who is culpable for people’s deaths, whether he’s guilty of murder or not. But they’re celebrating him for going and trying to effectively defend the things that the police weren’t defending. But that celebration is sick, no? Well, it’s dangerous, right? Because it’s going — it sends a message to other dumb — I mean, I don’t agree. Again, I think what Kyle Rittenhouse did was moronic at best, and people are dead because he, at best, was a moron. And I’m not celebrating it. I think that when you have an abdication of sort of civil authority to protect people’s property and sometimes lives, then you’re going to get a mood that’s sympathetic to vigilantism, yeah. I don’t think that’s remotely surprising. No, no, well, that’s not— granted, Ross, that’s not a celebration. That sounds a little bit to me like it’s at least in the zip code of a justification. I mean, I think that if Kyle Rittenhouse had not been a 17-year-old teenager from another state, but had been a small business owner, who was armed when people came into their business and started setting it on fire, then it would have been justified, yeah. Right. But that’s if it had been a totally different situation, right? [LAUGHING] Exactly. Exactly. Thank you, Michelle. Well, yeah, yes. But I’m saying that there is a reason that, in situations where people are going around burning businesses, that people get sympathetic to vigilantism. And it’s dumb to be sympathetic to the kind of vigilantism that Kyle Rittenhouse embodied. But just saying we can’t — it’s sick to celebrate vigilantism in a climate of people’s businesses being torched, then — I mean, people’s businesses getting torched is sick, right? Some of the people doing things in these riots, not just the people shooting cops and things like that, but people torching somebody’s livelihood, that’s sick too, right? Well, I don’t know. I mean, to me, it sounds like I could make the same argument, but I won’t, that, say, in a climate where police are shooting people and the government is not protecting them, then it makes sense that people will riot as — what is the Martin Luther King line? A riot is the voice of the unheard. I could construct a similar justification for rioting and looting, but I won’t do it. And it sounds like, to me, that’s what you’re doing, basically, kind of desperate times call for desperate measures. Why don’t we achieve consensus here and say that I will say that crossing state lines with a gun to try and interject yourself into a gravely chaotic situation, whatever mitigating circumstances there are, that is both a stupid and a wicked thing to do. It’s also wicked to burn somebody’s business, right? Oh, yes, of course. Of course. I think it’s less wicked to burn someone’s business than to kill someone. OK, is it less wicked to burn someone’s business than to take your gun and try and stand guard around someone’s business? What Kyle Rittenhouse intended to do, which was stand guard around someone’s car dealership that might have been torched, is that more wicked than torching a car dealership? Less wicked? Wash? What do you think? I think it’s more dangerous. But beyond these gradations, which, to me, are almost getting a little silly, is when you enter a situation like that, when you walk into a room that is strewn with fuel with a match, bad things are going to happen. I mean, this is a volatile situation that your presence is going to do nothing but render more volatile. But the reason I dwelled on it, Ross, is — No, but look. But Frank, the conservative — the thing that you’re reacting to so strongly from conservatives here is rooted in the fact that you’re describing the burning building in these sort of abstract terms like it’s a situation, or there’s things on fire. But in fact, people are setting those fires. People are torching those businesses. People are performing actions that are wrong. No, and it is — I mean, it’s striking to me to listen — Ross, the degree of emotion that I can tell you feel about this, where, to me, it is kind of bad. I feel immensely sorry for some of these small business owners who are not implicated in police violence. But it doesn’t bring up the same emotion in me as seeing police shoot unarmed civilians or police — OK, but the police shooting unarmed civilians is obviously worse than burning a building. But we’re having an argument about the idiot kid who tries to protect the car dealership, right? No, I’m actually trying not to have an argument — I’m trying not to have an argument about the kid. I’m trying to have an argument, or not even an argument, about the disparate reactions to what’s going on. So I started— we went down this Kyle Rittenhouse rabbit hole when I was asking why people on the right were celebrating him, were lionizing, were going well beyond justifying him, including the president, right? And earlier, you made a reference, Ross, to will Joe Biden condemn certain actions on the left? Well, he has now in Pittsburgh yesterday. We’re recording on Tuesday. In Pittsburgh on Monday, he said, these protests that get out of hand, the sooner — we have — what I’m focused on here is the real imbalance between what Joe Biden has said and will say and I think will continue to say and what Donald Trump won’t say and isn’t saying. And it’s not just Donald Trump. This has spread throughout the Republican Party. There was a fascinating interview on Sunday that Dana Bash of CNN did with Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin, where she asked him if he would condemn the violence. And he kept dancing around the words because he was clearly so worried that if he seemed to be condemning Kyle Rittenhouse and people who’d run to those burning stores that you’re talking about, Ross, that he would somehow alienate his political constituency. I just think that’s weird, dangerous, and unhealthy. My strong impression is that we have passed through a months-long period in which Democratic politicians and much of the mainstream press have wanted to insist that riots have not been as bad as riots have actually been because they are supportive of the cause of the protests that the riots have been attached to. That’s my impression of the story of the last few months. I will grant you, Ross, the riots have been horrible. And I think sometimes, there’s a big element of truth to what you’re saying. And part of the challenge right now for Joe Biden is, I think, a lot of people feel that they’re not hearing a stern enough condemnation, that people are not admitting fully that people gave protesters too much of a pass in terms of gathering amid a pandemic and all of that. Well, I don’t think that’s. That’s a separate issue. I would like some empirical understanding of how bad the riots have been versus how bad they’ve been presented in the mainstream media. Because my impression, being back here in New York City, is that there’s this presentation of New York and other urban areas as this sort of crime-ridden hellscape, when, in reality, being back in New York, I wouldn’t really know any of this was going on if I didn’t see it on television or on the internet. It’s much more contained, at least here, than you would understand from reading mainstream newspapers, from watching cable news, from looking at it on the internet. I feel like I hear similar things from people in Portland, who will say, you know, there’s this idea that the city is on fire. But if you’re out of a few-block radius, you’re barely even aware of it. And so it’s just not clear to me that the scope of the riots has been underplayed. I think the scope of the riots have now been overplayed on the right. But I think that in our world of media, I think there was a period of a couple months when the scale of the damage in places like Minneapolis, especially, was underplayed. And also, there was a spasm of looting in Chicago a few weeks ago. And it was bad enough that they raised the bridges around Chicago to try and keep people from entering or leaving downtown in order to contain it. And it got only coverage, as far as I can tell, from local media and right-wing media. And you know, I cited the example of the CHAZ stuff in Seattle. I think what was — everything that was wrong there got a lot more coverage after the fact, after it had been shut down. I guess all I’m saying is that I think — not to be all both sides here. But I think both sides are engaged in a kind of dangerous denial of parts of reality. So can I say something to that? I mean, I do think that left-wing social media has had a really deleterious effect in that there is such stigma in seeming to call out, quote-unquote, “bad protesters” or make distinctions between good and bad protesters, or say commonsense things about the political impact of unrest. If you look at the firing of David Shor, which is something that maybe took up more oxygen in some of these debates than you would think the firing of a data analyst would usually receive. And it was because this data analyst for a progressive consulting firm, who was fired from tweeting out a study by a Black Princeton professor about how riots in 1968 helped boost Richard Nixon’s vote share. So I think this bleeds over a little bit. And Democratic politicians, to the extent that they are too online, might be hampered in making what seem like commonsense points to a lot of their constituents. But at the same time, I don’t buy the idea that this stuff has not been widely covered. There’s also an element of just journalists — there are — some of our very brave colleagues are traveling and are reporting and kind of risking their health to do it. But I think fewer people are doing it than would have done in the past because of the pandemic. So there’s a bit of a fog of war element to try and figure out what is going on in CHAZ. But the reason that we know how bad CHAZ got is because of a big story in “The New York Times.” I think there’s truth to that. I also, though, think that there has been a lot — precisely because Donald Trump keeps talking about Antifa, there has been a lot of pressure to say like, oh Antifa, that just means people who are against fascism, or Antifa, that doesn’t really exist, or it only exists in Tom Cotton’s fervent imagination. But it doesn’t exist in the way that they talk about it as like — you hear Laura Logan talking about how they’re getting marching orders. And there’s this rumor that Donald Trump spread of black-clad people on an airplane. I mean, I know these people. I’ve reported on these people enough to know that, yeah, you have kind of black bloc idiots in every single metropolitan area in the country who are always trying to hijack protests and break shit. And that’s something that precedes this current moment. There’s overlap but also a distinction between the black bloc and Antifa, if we really want to go down that road. They’re not entirely the same thing. But there has been this attempt to basically turn kind of black bloc idiots into a well-organized terrorist threat. That’s ridiculous. I think it’s wrong to see them as a well-organized terrorist threat. I think, as someone who’s spent much of the last three years in arguments with people on my right, saying, look, you Antifa, this is not really a real thing. This is just a bunch of idiots cosplaying. I think we’ve established that those people are capable of doing substantial amounts of property damage and creating extremely dangerous environments in American cities, when given the opportunity afforded by a pandemic, Donald Trump, and mass protests. I would say that I underestimated the capacities of those idiots to sustain arson, damage, looting, and violence over a multi-month period. I think they’ve done a fairly impressive job in a lot of American cities of doing that. And that doesn’t make them the next ISIS. It doesn’t make them an existential threat to the US. It doesn’t make Donald Trump right in his fantasies about black-clad Antifa ninjas on a plane. But it’s still kind of a big story, right? I don’t know. I think it’s really unclear. Look, there’s clearly these kids who’ve been dreaming of— I don’t know — some sort of overthrow of the system for their whole lives and think that this is their big shot. And you kind of burn down enough coffee shops, and the next thing you know, you have the end of capitalism. [LAUGHTER] But it’s very unclear— Which is true. I mean, we should concede that that’s true. There is a moment at which capitalism will end. But it’s very unclear to me how much of this is Antifa, how much of it is just opportunists that see looting going on and want in on it, how much of it is other sorts of protesters. And then there is — I think that people on the left can overplay the role of right-wing provocateurs, but they’re also part of the mix. If you want to talk about what happened in Minneapolis, there was that black-clad guy that really kicked off a lot of the arson and property damage. And you obviously can’t blame him for all of it. But I think people can look back and say that’s when it started. And we do now know, or at least he’s been arrested and charged as being a white supremacist provocateur. So I think that there is still a fair degree of confusion about the precise makeup and the precise breakdown of responsibility for what’s happening right now. [MUSIC PLAYING] Let’s take a quick break, and we’ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] And we’re back. So the election is exactly two months away. And this issue, clearly, is going to linger throughout it. Michelle, you said earlier you think Trump wants this violence. Do you think, at the end of the day, it is going to help him on November 3, or I should say, beforehand as well, since a lot of the voting this year is going to be mail-in? I mean, I should say that because I am so terrified of what’s going to happen, I fear in my darkest moments that it will. I don’t see how you can experience the 2016 election and not think that white backlash is an incredibly powerful force in American politics. But I think that might be more my emotions talking than anything empirical. There was one poll that showed some tightening. There’s been some anecdotal reporting, including in our newspaper. But overall, the polls are really, really stable. In the 1968 analogy, Donald Trump is not Richard Nixon. He’s L.B.J., right, in that it’s kind of hard to make the case that you need to re-elect me president to stop the violence and chaos that has happened while I’m president. Ross, what do you think the political fallout of this is going to be? How do you see this coloring the presidential race? I mean, so I wrote a column weeks ago now, where I tried to imagine how Trump could possibly come back. This was when Biden was up by an average of 10, I think, in a lot of polls. And the scenario I spun out was basically that Trump needed COVID infections to drop dramatically, that he needed some of the early herd immunity theories to be true. And he probably needed the violent fringe of the protests to become much more salient going into the election. A very mild version of that is happening. COVID infection rates have fallen, not as far as we would like them, but they have fallen. And the violent fringe of the protests has gotten somewhat more salient. I think it’s understandable that liberals would be worried. And I think it’s reasonable to worry in the sense that— the incumbency point that Michelle makes is, I think, partially right. But there is another reality, which actually, David Shor, the data analyst Michelle mentioned in the first segment, who was fired, famously, for some of his tweeting about the politics of riots, he makes this argument about issues salience, that voters, for better or worse, trust one party more than the other on a particular issue. And so if you raise the salience of that issue, who’s got the policies that technically poll best might be less important than just the fact that the issue is salient. So if you raise the issue salience of health care, the policy details may not matter as much as the fact that voters tend to trust Democrats more on health care. If that issue becomes more salient, it’s good for the Democrats. And so if voters trust Republicans more on fighting crime and controlling urban riots, then even if Donald Trump doesn’t have a 10-point plan to stop the urban riots, the more you raise the salience of that issue, the more potential advantages Republicans have. So that, I think, is one way of arguing that what’s happened in the last few weeks around these issues should make Democrats worried. That being said, Trump is not— I mean, we were saying this in the first segment. But Trump is running against Joe Biden. Joe Biden is a famously moderate Democrat with a tough-on-crime past who’s, to put it charitably, a little bit past his prime as a political communicator, but still is perfectly capable of giving a speech where he says, riots are bad, right? And Trump is not really capable of sustaining a Richard-Nixon-type, claiming-the-center strategy. And to the extent that that’s the basic political reality of the race, I think things would need to get a lot better with the coronavirus and a lot worse with the riots before full Democratic panic would be justified. So you said Biden is perfectly capable of giving a speech decrying the violence. He gave that speech on Monday in Pittsburgh. Michelle, did you think he accomplished what he needed to? Do you think that speech was on the mark? Yeah, I mean, it’s a difficult thing for me to evaluate because there’s sort of like what I want Biden to do because I think it will help him win versus what I believe. So what I believe is that the real problem here is police violence. And that is what you have to tackle first. Do I believe that it is good for Biden to decry these riots and to show wavering suburbanites that he cares about urban unrest and that he’s going to keep them safe, even though I believe that they are already 100 percent safe from this phenomenon? Yes, I do. So to me, the speech was great. And I thought it was great also because it opened up the obvious question. Yes, I condemn violence. I condemn left-wing extremism. Your turn. Why won’t you do it? If we just had a whole news cycle about is this bad for Biden, why won’t Biden condemn the riots, will he condemn them strongly enough — it’s frustrating that it seems unlikely that we’re not going to have a similar news cycle about Trump, again, because nobody expects anything of him. Except that the news cycle is always about how Trump is bad. Why won’t Biden do this thing that he needs to do to make sure this bad man is beaten? I mean, that’s the dynamic, at least of CNN. It’s not the dynamic everywhere. But it’s a pretty common media dynamic. And Trump does get— after Charlottesville that Trump had some of his worst polling numbers. When Trump is seen as not condemning right-wing extremists, white supremacists, and so on, it shows up in the polls. And the Trump campaign — other people have made this point, maybe Josh Barro or somebody. But they keep setting up really easy tests for Joe Biden to pass. They’re like, oh, Joe Biden, he won’t leave his basement. He can’t speak. He just mumbles. And then he gives a normal, pretty good convention speech. And it’s like, OK, pass that test. And then they’re like, well, Joe Biden won’t condemn the riots. And so Joe Biden gives a speech condemning the riots. And now, the bar will be Joe Biden won’t specifically condemn Antifa. And as you can tell from the first segment, I think Joe Biden should specifically condemn Antifa. Think he could go further in his specific attacks to the left. But I think if that seems politically necessary, he obviously will do that. He did something else really smart, I think, in his remarks on Monday. And I think he said it several times. It was simple. But he certainly said it once loud and clear. And like I said, I think multiple times, where he kind of said to voters, you know me. You know me. And that was bigger than just about the violence and whether he condemns the violence. Obviously, whether they’re trying to pin him into a corner by being not sufficiently condemning of the violence, whether they’re trying to do it in other ways, they’re saying that— Trump and his surrogates and his enablers, they’re all saying that Joe Biden is a hostage of the left or will be a hostage of the left. And I just think it’s very effective when he speaks plainly and simply and trades on what is his greatest strength, which is that he has been around a long time, and he is not scary to Middle America. And I just really, really, I thought, was smart, and it really kind of rang out when he said, I believe multiple times, in his remarks to voters, you know me. Well, and he said, do I look like a radical socialist to you? Like, come on. Yeah, I think that’s an effective line. I mean, I don’t want to — I think there was a little bit of over-praising the Biden speech maybe from journalists who were panicked by a few of those post-convention polls. And Biden has lost a step. That’s just not really disputable. He is not as vigorous a politician as he was eight or 10 years ago. And that’s a weakness. And he sort of wanders verbally more than he used to. He’s not a dynamic presidential candidate at all. But that’s probably OK for the kind of race he’s trying to win. It may actually be to his advantage, given how exhausting Donald Trump is to most Americans. I don’t know. I worry about it a lot. The Democrats haven’t won with a candidate over 55 in a really long time. You know, LBJ seems like an ancient person, but he was, I think, 55 when he became president. We don’t have a great record of, in either party, electing kind of old Senate warhorses. And I don’t know. It definitely scares me. I mean, it’s why I didn’t want him to be the nominee, even though I now think he has some strengths. But wait a second, Michelle. You wanted Elizabeth Warren, and she’s 71 now. So — But she’s a vigorous 71, Frank. I mean, she is. She’s more vigorous. OK, I will admit she’s a much more vigorous 71 than Joe is at 77. But I mean, she breaks that paradigm of Democrats winning with the youngest candidate. I’m just— Yeah, but, you know, 71 in woman years. Fair enough. Fair enough. You know. [LAUGHS] I mean, but I think that is what Michelle is saying is that the danger for Biden is that he doesn’t turn out young voters at quite the rates that a more — either a more dynamic or more left-wing candidate would have, and that his age and wobbliness becomes a problem in the event that, if there were sustained rioting and the politics of law and order just stay incredibly salient in states like Wisconsin and Minnesota, then the Democratic candidate needs to — he needs to project some toughness, some sense that if it’s necessary to sort of bang heads — again, not of criminals, but of mayors, of going after his own governors or his own mayors and so on, that he can do that. And a little more 1980s Biden would probably be better for this campaign. Is one of the dangers for Biden us? And by that, I mean the media. And what I’m talking about is I kind of notice in this most recent thing with urban — with the violence and the protests as a good example. You know, Donald Trump spotlights an issue, takes some position on it, says something provocative. And the media immediately begins writing, how is Joe Biden going to respond? And I see a lot of people making the correct comment that Biden isn’t controlling or seizing the narrative. But I’m not sure we allow him to. I feel like, for all of our hand-wringing and soul searching and self-examination about the way we covered Trump, I still think we let him define the event of a given 24, 72-hour news cycle. And then it becomes how will Joe Biden respond. And I’m not sure how Biden breaks out of that if, in fact, it’s a pattern that we’ve established. Michelle, am I seeing— are you seeing this too? Or— I think that’s right. I mean, and again, I think there’s a bit of a chicken and an egg thing, like I said before, where it’s hard to say, is the media responding to a genuine shift in the electorate or the polling? Or is the media creating a narrative because it’s sort of that time in the race when you need a new story besides Biden is inevitable and Trump is self destructing. But I definitely do think that — again, the media, I think it both sort of follows Trump’s lead on defining the issues and then lets him off the hook so that there’s not a — you don’t see a lot of reporting. And I do think that Ross is right in that, because I think a lot of journalists do fear for the republic, so they’re not sort of worried about what Trump is doing wrong. There’s not a sense of what does Trump have to do to right the ship. That piece Jamelle wrote is the kind of piece that you see about Biden all the time and you basically never see about Trump. You never see people sort of suggesting that Trump might be losing the center. You never see people dwelling on Trump’s refusal to disavow the far right. And so I do think that there is a little bit of chronic both-sidesing that I think was a big, big problem for Hillary Clinton. I think that the media vastly inflated the salience of email server management as an issue. And I think voters took a cue from that, that this is a really big deal. And I think that they could be doing the same thing over again. Yeah, well, but it’s different, right? Biden is not — there’s a lot of coverage of, is Biden doing enough to win? Is Biden going to blow it and so on? There’s very little critical scrutiny of Biden’s actual record. I mean, we’re not getting a range of stories that are — the stories that liberals feared we’d get, that are like, well, what about the Biden family’s overseas business dealings? I mean, there was a bunch of stories about Biden not being left enough during the primary campaign. But there’s — I don’t know. I mean, I feel like there’s very little, let’s say, of the media echoing the Trump campaign’s narrative about Biden, right? The Trump campaign’s narrative about Biden is that he is an embodiment of a failed American establishment that outsourced American jobs overseas and led us into disastrous wars in the Middle East. And that’s kind of true. [LAUGHS] But nobody in the media is echoing that line. Nobody in the media is re-excavating Biden’s Iraq war vote or things like that in the way that the media did, I think, play into Trump’s “crooked Hillary” narrative in 2016. I think all of the Biden stuff is about — right now, at least, we’ve still got a little ways to go — is just about is he doing enough. And they aren’t trying to like grab the narrative with huge policy speeches and big ideas. I mean, I don’t know if you can completely blame the media for what is, in fact, choices that the Biden campaign is making, which is to run a — it’s a very cautious, front-porch-style campaign. I mean, Biden’s convention speech was— I mean, it was actually really distinctive. It was really short. It had almost no policy in it. It was just a personal appeal. Like I’m Joe Biden. You know who I am. I’m a good guy. Donald Trump’s terrible. He’s messed up the coronavirus. Vote for me. That’s the Biden strategy. And it is vulnerable, but it’s vulnerable to external events like the coronavirus diminishing and riots getting worse. No, but that’s an excellent point. It’s impossible to seize the narrative if, in fact, you’re protecting a lead. And that has been the Biden strategy. It factors into why Kamala Harris was the vice-presidential choice. I think there has been an assumption that he’s ahead, that if you just kind of extrapolate forward far enough, he ends up ahead, he ends up winning. And let’s not do anything wrong. Let’s not take any big risks. Let’s protect our lead. I think that’s a big part of the dynamic. And I think that’s what you’re referring to Ross, right? Yeah. And he does — well, and the other little thing is that, because there’s an assumption that Trump can win the electoral college even if he loses the popular vote by 2 or 3 points, there’s also a weird uncertainty in the media narrative about how much is Biden really winning by. If he is up by 8 points, that’s huge by modern presidential campaign standards. On the other hand, it’s only a 5-point lead from an electoral college point of view. So there’s a certain kind of whip sawing and uncertainty in the media narrative there, too, I think. And the media is, once again, despite its promises every four years not to do so, covering the horse race more than anything else. Here we are talking about polling margins and all of that. I’m raising my hand and saying, guilty as charged, you know? No, but I don’t think there’s anything to be guilty of. I mean, we’re talking about is there going to be a recognizable American republic three months from now. The question of kind of who’s ahead and who’s behind in that existential contest is a big one and it’s actually way more important than anything in Biden’s policy platform. Without necessarily agreeing with that argument, [BRUNI LAUGHS] I will say that it’s also true that Trump is not rolling out policy ideas regularly either. I mean, there is nothing but — with Biden running a cautious, low-policy campaign, and Trump running a scattershot, demagogic, low-policy campaign — I mean, in 2016, Trump had more policy. He had an actual sort of critique of the neoliberal establishment that was really important to his closing argument in 2016. And that sort of resurfaced in the Republican convention. But it’s not really there. Trump’s not really running on policy. So what else does the media have to write about except the horse race? Well, this is a great place to end because it’s not often that all three of us are in perfect alignment, and on the fact that this is not a policy election, I think we have total, total agreement, right? Yes, absolutely. And I guess agreement is also a good place to end your wonderful stint as part of our show here, Frank. And we will miss you terribly. But since this is your final “Argument” episode, we, of course, have to turn to you for the recommendation. So what will you give us as a parting gift as you say goodbye? Well, since it’s my last recommendation ever, at least on the show — I hope I have recommendations in my life. [LAUGHS] You’re going to do your own podcast that’s just recommendations. I have, over the last five years, become this strange and stubborn evangelist for the short story that is one of my favorite short stories ever called “In the Cemetery Where Al Jolson is Buried.” Has either of you ever read it? No. No. It’s by the famed, accomplished, terrific short story writer, Amy Hempel. It’s title does not prepare you for what it’s about. It’s basically about a woman watching a friend die. And yet it manages to be jovial to the point of jocular until the final paragraphs. And it is the story that just does this amazing thing, where you’re kind of rolling along with it. You’re feeling little pinpricks of grief and sorrow. And then in the last couple of sentences, it just tears your heart straight out of your chest. Now, you’re thinking, why am I recommending this? I’m one of those people who, when I’m feeling a little blue, I like to take the feeling all the way down until it comes back over the top. I get a glass of wine. I listen to Billie Holiday. And I read “In the Cemetery Where Al Jolson is Buried” by Amy Hempel. If you Google it, you will find the entire story online. And you can read it without buying anything. When I read it that way, I did not own any Amy Hempel book. I felt like I owed her for the intense pleasure. And so my recommendation is read the story online. And if you’re as taken with it as I am, reward Amy Hempel, and do the right thing by buying a copy of “The Collected Stories of Amy Hempel,” in which there are many, many other gems. But the peak, the Everest is “In the Cemetery Where Al Jolson is Buried.” I’m also a wallower, so I’ll do that. You’ll love this. And Frank, I guess, bringing us all the way down to the bottom so we can come back up is a good metaphor or synecdoche or some literary form for how you’re departing our show. [LAUGHTER] So— Or I was actually going to say for the Trump years. He’s bringing all the way to the bottom so we can come back up the top. Yeah! Well, we’ll save that for — The worse the better. We’ll save that for December. But Frank, thank you again for being with us over these totally insane months. And we will miss you terribly. Yes, thank you, Frank. Thank you guys. I’ll miss you. And I’ll miss the listeners for “The Argument.” I thank them for bearing with me. And may the road always rise to meet your feet and, you know, the rest of an Irish proverb. [LAUGHTER] I’m on the road, Ross. I’m on the road. [THEME MUSIC] Now, just one more thing before we go this week. We’re going to start releasing this podcast on Fridays rather than on Thursdays in an effort to catch more of the week’s news as the election heats up. So starting next week, we’ll be talking to you and arguing with each other on Fridays instead. And with that, that’s our show this week. Thank you for listening. The team includes Phoebe Lett, Vishakha Darbha, Kristin Lin, Isaac Jones, and Paula Szuchman. Special thanks to Kathy Tu. “The Argument” will be back in your feed next Friday. Wait, what are peaches and herbs? Oh, Ross. Oh, Ross! Peaches & Herb, it’s an R&B duo that did the song “Reunited,” which is a prom staple. Oh, man. You obviously never went — you didn’t go to your prom, did you? I didn’t. We’re really going to excavate some pretty some pretty dark territory here if we go down that road. [LAUGHTER] Listen and subscribe to “The Argument” from your mobile device: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google Play | RadioPublic | Stitcher | RSS Feed The Trump re-election strategy has revealed itself: Cast American cities as hotbeds of chaos, and place the blame entirely on the Democratic Party. Yet why is unrest being seen as a weakness for Joe Biden, and not the man in charge? Is the media unthinkingly accepting a Republican narrative? This week on the podcast, Frank, Michelle and Ross argue about the protests and counterprotests in Portland, Ore., and Kenosha, Wis., and disagree over the politicization of the clashes. They debate the lines between vigilantism and rioting and discuss the role coverage plays in the perception of the violence. And as a fitting parting gift on his final episode of “The Argument,” Frank recommends a short story that goes from jocular to chest-gripping grief in just 10 pages.

I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist for The Times since 2011, but my career with the newspaper stretches back to 1995 and includes many twists and turns that reflect my embarrassingly scattered interests. I covered Congress, the White House and several political campaigns; I also spent five years in the role of chief restaurant critic. As the Rome bureau chief, I reported on the Vatican; as a staff writer for The Times’s Sunday magazine, I wrote many celebrity profiles. That jumble has informed my various books, which focus on the Roman Catholic Church, George W. Bush, my strange eating life, the college admissions process and meatloaf. Politically, I’m grief-stricken over the way President Trump has governed and I’m left of center, but I don’t think that the center is a bad place or “compromise” a dirty word. I’m Italian-American, I’m gay and I write a weekly Times newsletter in which you’ll occasionally encounter my dog, Regan, who has the run of our Manhattan apartment. @FrankBruni I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they intersect. I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis, and decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have four small children, three girls and a boy, and live in New Haven with my wife. @DouthatNYT I’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter. @michelleinbklyn “The Argument” is a production of The New York Times Opinion section.
