A Spanish-language Trump ad glosses over his contentious history with Puerto Rico. Mary Trump files a lawsuit claiming that fraud was a ‘way of life’ for her family. The F.B.I. has seen no evidence of a nationwide effort to defraud mail-in ballots, its director says. TRANSCRIPT “Will you commit here, today, for a peaceful transferral of power after the election?” “Well, we’re going to have to see what happens. You know that I’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots, and the ballots are a disaster, and —” Reporter: “I understand that, but people are rioting. Do you commit to making sure that there’s a peaceful transferral of power?” “We want to have — get rid of the ballots and you’ll have a very, we’ll have a very peaceful — there won’t be a transfer, frankly. There’ll be a continuation. The ballots are out of control. You know it. And you know who knows it better than anybody else? The Democrats know it better than anybody else — go ahead.” President Trump’s refusal to commit to accepting the results of November’s election — something no other modern president has put in doubt — led several prominent Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to insist Thursday that there would be a peaceful transfer of power come January. But they stopped short of directly criticizing the president. “The winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th,” Mr. McConnell wrote on Twitter. “There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792.” Mr. McConnell did not mention Mr. Trump in his comments, and he refused to elaborate on them. But his tweet was in response to Mr. Trump’s comment on Wednesday, when a reporter asked if the president would commit to a peaceful transition, that “We’re going to have to see what happens.” Mr. Trump went on to question the integrity of “the ballots” — apparently referring to mail-in voting, which he has falsely called rife with fraud — and added that if he were able to “get rid of” the ballots and ensure a “continuation” rather than a “transfer,” it would be peaceful. The peaceful transfer of power and accepting election results are fundamentals of democracy. Many Republicans, including Mr. McConnell, while declining to call the president out by name, distanced themselves from the remarks and insisted that there would be a peaceful transfer of power if former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. won the presidency. When asked if Republicans would stand up to the president should he resist departing the office in event of a political loss, Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, told reporters on Thursday that he believed they would. “Republicans believe in the rule of law, we believe in the Constitution, and that’s what dictates what happens in our election process,” Mr. Thune told reporters on Capitol Hill. Moderate Republicans, including those facing tough bids for re-election, dismissed the suggestion that there would be anything other than a peaceful transition of power, with Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, declaring, “of course we’re going to have a peaceful transition of power.  We’re the United States of America. We’re not a banana republic.” “I don’t know what his thinking was, but we have always had a controlled transition between administrations,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. She said “the peaceful transfer of power is a fundamental tenet of our democracy, and I am confident that we will see it occur once again.” Some Republicans, including Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, sought to change the subject from Mr. Trump’s remarks, arguing that his comments were no different from comments Hillary Clinton made last month suggesting Mr. Biden should not concede. Ms. Clinton did not say Mr. Biden should “never” concede, but rather that because vote counting could be protracted this year because of the increase in mail ballots, he should not concede, if he was trailing, until the results were finalized. “I think there will be a peaceful transfer of power, and I think the real concern in terms of the election is that Joe Biden has been explicit that if he doesn’t win on Election Day, he intends to challenge the legitimacy of the election,” said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, though it was not immediately clear what remarks he was referring to and Mr. Biden has repeatedly warned that it is Mr. Trump who is seeking to undermine the election results. Mr. Cruz also raised the specter of Ms. Clinton’s comments. “I think that threat to challenge the election is one of the real reasons why it is so important that we confirm the Supreme Court nominees so that there’s a full Supreme Court on the bench to resolve any election challenge,’' he said. In an interview on Fox on Thursday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, used the outcry over Mr. Trump’s remarks to push for the quick confirmation of a conservative Supreme Court justice, arguing that the seat should be filled in case the nation’s highest court needed to rule on the outcome of the November election. “People wonder about the peaceful transfer of power,” he said. “I can assure you, it will be peaceful.” He added, “I promise you as a Republican, if the Supreme Court decides that Joe Biden wins, I will accept the result. The court will decide, and if Republicans lose, we’ll accept the result.” That promise comes as Mr. Graham and other Republicans face sharp criticism for their sharp reversal on their past vow not to fill a Supreme Court seat during an election year. Even as he drew a comparison between Ms. Clinton’s remarks and those made by Mr. Trump on Wednesday, Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, acknowledged that “I think all of this talk, by both the Biden campaign and the president, is unhelpful.”  — Emily Cochrane and Glenn Thrush Democratic lawmakers warned Americans on Thursday to take deadly seriously President Trump’s refusal to commit to accepting the results of November’s election, accusing the president of poisoning the wellspring of democracy in a cynical attempt to hold onto power. “When a leader with authoritarian tendencies tells you they intend to do something outrageous, like not accept a peaceful transition after an election, as President Trump said, you should believe them,” said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and a close ally of Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, the nation’s third highest officeholder, balanced criticizing Mr. Trump with trying to project calm. “You are not in North Korea; you are not in Turkey,” Ms. Pelosi said to Mr. Trump, citing nations with authoritarian leaders. “You are in the United States of America. It is a democracy, so why don’t you just try for a moment to honor your oath of office to the Constitution of the United States.” She told reporters that she had a good sense of what Mr. Trump was trying to do and would fight tooth and nail to prevent it. The most important thing, she said, was for Americans to vote and insist their ballots are counted. “The antidote to almost every ailment I have named is the vote,” she said. After four years of outrageous statements and threats to bulldoze over institutional norms that govern the nation’s democracy, congressional Democrats are exceedingly accustomed to chiding Mr. Trump. Even so, their comments betrayed a greater level of alarm than normal — and than did remarks by Mr. Biden, who said Wednesday night that Mr. Trump said “the most irrational things” and wondered, “What country are we in?” Asked during a call with reporters on Thursday to respond to Mr. Trump’s remarks, Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, said that he “has participated in a peaceful transition of power before. He certainly will this time around as well.” “Donald Trump is trying to distract from his catastrophic failures as president of the United States in order to talk about something that frankly, you know, spins up the press corps,” she added. Calling Mr. Trump “the greatest threat to democracy,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the party leader in the Senate, demanded that Republicans join Democrats in insisting Mr. Trump accept the election results. He said too many were trying to “brush it by.” “At this perilous moment, every Republican in this chamber should stand up and say that a president who isn’t entirely sure if he’ll commit to a peaceful transfer of power isn’t a president at all,” he added. Several prominent Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, insisted Thursday that there would be a peaceful transition, but they stopped short of criticizing the president directly for his remarks. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, who led the drive to impeach Mr. Trump in the House and argued forcefully for his removal in a Senate trial earlier this year, said flatly: “This is how democracy dies.” He pledged Democrats would fight back. “America belongs to the people,” Mr. Schiff said. — Nicholas Fandos and Sydney Ember Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Thursday that President Trump “will accept the results of a free and fair election,” downplaying his refusal the day before to commit to a peaceful transfer of power without categorically stating whether he would accept the results. “He will accept the will of the American people,” she added. During a daily press briefing, Ms. McEnany was pressed on Mr. Trump’s remark, which he made Wednesday evening in response to a question about the possibility that he might lose the November election at a time of widespread unrest in American cities. Ms. McEnany would not further characterize the president’s views, but sought to turn against Democrats the outrage and alarm triggered among both parties by the president’s comments. “I think that your question is more fitting to be asked of Democrats who have already been on the record saying they won’t accept the results of an election,” she said, quoting party leaders who have in fact warned that Mr. Trump might try to claim victory illegitimately. She cited an August comment from Mr. Trump’s 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “should not concede under any circumstances.” But Mrs. Clinton was referring only to election night itself, warning that a final accurate tally may not be known until days or weeks later, in part because of potentially late-arriving mail-in votes Mr. Trump is seeking to discredit. She also repeatedly noted that the reporter who had asked Mr. Trump yesterday about a power transfer works for Playboy magazine. The White House has previously complained about that reporter, Brian Karem, and even unsuccessfully sought to revoke his press pass. It is unclear why Mr. Trump continues to call on him in briefings. Ms. McEnany also condemned protesters who jeered Mr. Trump as he visited Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s coffin atop the Supreme Court steps on Thursday. “The chants were appalling, but certainly to be expected when you’re in the heart of the swamp,” she said. — Michael Crowley Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont gave an address Thursday about a topic he said he had never in his “wildest dreams” expected that he would have to confront: “the need to make certain that the president of the United States, if he loses this election, will abide by the will of the voters and leave office peacefully.” “This is not just an election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden,” Mr. Sanders said in a speech at George Washington University that was streamed online a day after President Trump declined to commit to a peaceful transfer of power in the event he lost the election. “This is an election between Donald Trump and democracy — and democracy must win.” Mr. Sanders accused the president of trying to suppress the vote by seeking cuts at the Postal Service and challenging mail-in ballots. “Finding himself behind in many polls, he is attempting massive voter suppression,” Mr. Sanders said. Then he outlined his plan to preserve American democracy. He urged voters to turn out, saying that “a landslide victory for Biden will make it virtually impossible for Trump to deny the results and is our best means for defending democracy.” He called on state legislatures to allow mail-in votes to be counted before Election Day as a way to prevent Mr. Trump from declaring the race over before all the votes had been tallied. And he called for a unified plan from Congress and state legislatures to ensure a peaceful election. Mr. Sanders also urged media outlets to prepare voters for the reality that the final results might not be known on election night, and urged social media companies to “get their act together and stop people from using their tools to spread disinformation.” — Isabella Grullón Paz TRANSCRIPT [crowd jeering] Crowd: “Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out! Vote him out!” President Trump paid his respects to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Thursday morning, standing silently by her coffin at the top of the Supreme Court steps as he was jeered by protesters on the street below. Wearing a face mask — unusual for him — and a sky-blue tie instead of his trademark red power tie, Mr. Trump stared ahead, and closed his eyes at times, near the justice’s flag-draped coffin. But the quiet of the moment was punctured by the boos and shouts of demonstrators about a block away. “Honor her wish!” yelled some, a reference to Justice Ginsburg’s deathbed request that her replacement not be confirmed until a “new president is installed.” Others shouted “Vote him out!” It was not clear whether Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, who joined him, could hear the heckling, which was clearly audible on television. They stayed for less than two minutes. Following Mr. Trump was his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien. Both men also wore masks, and bowed their heads with their eyes closed. Justice Ginsburg, who died last Friday, lay in repose at the court on Wednesday and Thursday. — Michael Crowley AD WATCH The Trump campaign released a trio of Spanish-language ads this week, including one targeted at Puerto Rican voters as his campaign tries to keep making inroads among Latinos.    The ad begins with an attack on Mr. Trump’s opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., showing him face to face with the former governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, as a narrator claims that Democrats have “ignored Puerto Rico” and supported a law that contributed to the island’s fiscal crisis. President Trump, the ad claims, has protected Puerto Rico’s future with “historic investments” as scenes of construction and what appears to be rebuilding after the devastation of Hurricane Maria flash onscreen. The ad closes with a new graphic from the Trump campaign: “Boricuas for Trump” —  Puerto Ricans for Trump, featuring the Puerto Rican flag. Despite the ad’s rosy depiction, Mr. Trump has had a contentious relationship with Puerto Rico. He has spent much of his first term harshly attacking the Puerto Rican government, and blocked or placed restrictions on federal assistance following the back-to-back hurricanes that battered the island in 2017. He even discussed the prospect of selling Puerto Rico. A sentence onscreen trumpets the $13 billion that Mr. Trump released last week to help rebuild the island’s electrical grid and repair schools, but neglects to mention that it was delayed for a full three years after the hurricanes hit. The ad also notes a contract that the Department of Defense announced last month with a pharmaceutical company to manufacture coronavirus testing swabs in Puerto Rico. On television in Florida, Georgia and Ohio, according to Advertising Analytics. The Trump campaign has made a concerted effort to chip away at Mr. Biden’s lead among Latinos, most notably in Florida. But the president’s yearslong criticisms of the island’s institutions and officials, and his withholding of federal disaster aid, will likely loom over any outreach to Puerto Ricans. — Nick Corasaniti Mary L. Trump, President Trump’s niece, filed a lawsuit Thursday accusing the president and his siblings of cheating her out of her inheritance, and claiming that, for the Trumps, “fraud was not just the family business — it was a way of life.” The suit by Ms. Trump, who claimed in her best-selling memoir that the president and other relatives had tricked, bullied and ultimately cheated her out of an inheritance worth tens of millions of dollars, was filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. It accused Mr. Trump, his sister Maryanne Trump Barry and their brother Robert, who died in August, of fraud and civil conspiracy. It seeks to recover the millions of dollars Ms. Trump claims to have lost. Ms. Trump, 55, claims to be one of her family’s victims. Her suit describes a plot against her, broken cinematically into three separate acts: “The Grift,” “The Devaluing” and “The Squeeze-Out.” It recounts a narrative that began in 1981, when Ms. Trump’s father, Fred Trump Jr., unexpectedly died, leaving her, at age 16, with a valuable minority stake in the family empire. The story ends nearly 40 years later, when Ms. Trump says she discovered, with the help of journalists from The New York Times, that President Trump and his siblings “used their position of power to con her into signing her interests away.” The White House has previously cast doubt on Ms. Trump’s book, which contains similar allegations, and has said the memoir was “in Ms. Trump’s own financial interest.” Lawyers for the president and Robert Trump were not immediately available for comment. Maryanne Trump Barry also did not immediately return a telephone call from a reporter.  — Alan Feuer The F.B.I. has not seen evidence of a “coordinated national voter fraud effort,” its director, Christopher A. Wray, told lawmakers on Thursday, undercutting President Trump’s effort to stoke fears about mail-in ballots by claiming without evidence that voting by mail is an election threat. Any fraud would have to be widespread and well coordinated to change the election outcome, and carrying it out would be a “major challenge for an adversary,” Mr. Wray said in comments before the Senate Homeland Security Committee. But he made clear he was not minimizing other threats to election security, including smaller-scale frauds on a local level. Mr. Wray’s testimony came a week after the president publicly attacked him for asserting at a House hearing that Russia was conducting election interference operations and that violent extremism was a significant threat. Though both issues are well-documented, Mr. Trump has long downplayed the Russia threat, seeing it as a threat to his legitimacy. And he has emphasized far-left extremism over the more prevalent threat from the far right and white supremacists. Earlier this week, the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security warned of potential interference in the election by foreigners aiming to exploit the extra time it takes to sort through the crush of ballots that are expected to be cast by mail by voters wary of the pandemic. During that time, the agencies said, hackers could amplify “disinformation that includes reports of voter suppression, cyberattacks targeting election infrastructure, voter or ballot fraud and other problems intended to convince the public of the elections’ illegitimacy.” — Adam Goldman and Zolan Kanno-Youngs President Trump is on the defensive in three red states he carried in 2016, narrowly trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Iowa and battling to stay ahead of him in Georgia and Texas, as Mr. Trump continues to face a wall of opposition from women that has also endangered his party’s control of the Senate, according to a poll conducted by The New York Times and Siena College. Joe Biden has made significant gains in states Donald Trump won handily in 2016. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely voters from Sept. 16 to Sept. 22. Mr. Trump’s vulnerability even in conservative-leaning states underscores just how precarious his political position is, less than six weeks before Election Day. While he and Mr. Biden are competing aggressively for traditional swing states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida, the poll suggests that Mr. Biden has assembled a coalition formidable enough to jeopardize Mr. Trump even in historically Republican parts of the South and Midwest. A yawning gender gap in all three states is working in Mr. Biden’s favor, with the former vice president making inroads into conservative territory with strong support from women. In Iowa, where Mr. Biden is ahead of Mr. Trump, 45 percent to 42 percent, he is up among women by 14 percentage points. Men favor Mr. Trump by eight points. In Georgia, where the two candidates are tied at 45 percent, Mr. Biden leads among women by 10 points. Mr. Trump is ahead with men by a similar margin of 11 percentage points. Mr. Trump’s large advantage among men in Texas is enough to give him a small advantage there, 46 percent to 43 percent. Men prefer the president to his Democratic challenger by 16 points, while women favor Mr. Biden by an eight-point margin. — Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin In speeches, in tweets, in interviews, President Trump keeps promising that he will preserve protections for Americans with pre-existing health conditions. It’s a crowd-pleaser of a policy, but one entirely at odds with his administration’s legislative, regulatory and legal record to date. The promise is likely to appear in television ads, the presidential debates and possibly in an oft-teased, ever forthcoming executive order on the subject. Vice President Pence said Tuesday that the president would “take action” in the days ahead. But rather than enshrine the ability of Americans with health problems to buy insurance, the Trump administration has, at every turn, pursued policies that have tended to do the opposite. Some of the efforts to weaken protections have been successful — like an expansion of cheap, lightly regulated health plans that insurers are not required to offer when customers are sick. Others, like multiple attempts to “repeal and replace Obamacare” in 2017, failed to attract enough Republican votes in Congress to pass. The Justice Department’s quest to overturn the Affordable Care Act, while no replacement is being offered, is still underway, with oral arguments scheduled at the Supreme Court in November. “We will always and very strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions,” Mr. Trump declared at the Republican convention last month. “We will protect your pre-existing conditions,” he said at a recent campaign rally in Las Vegas. In January, he went as far as to say he “saved pre-existing conditions.” Yet despite a record to the contrary, these repeated statements seem to be having an impact. A recent survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 84 percent of Republicans believe President Trump has a better approach for “maintaining protections for people with pre-existing conditions.” — Margot Sanger-Katz THE UPSHOT The most recent New York Times/Siena College polls of Texas, Iowa and Georgia found no serious evidence that the sudden opening of a Supreme Court seat, and the battle to fill it, has affected the race for the White House. Nor did the polls find much reason to think this would shift the race in the weeks ahead. The surveys were already underway before the death on Friday of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and neither Joe Biden nor President Trump fared meaningfully better in interviews conducted after her death. Opinions about the Supreme Court fight seemed poised to split along familiar partisan lines, with little advantage to either side. Beginning on Sunday, voters were asked three questions about the Supreme Court, although none in Iowa, where the survey was mostly complete by Sunday: The people who received these questions were not representative of the overall survey — it wound up being a Republican-leaning group — because many interviews had already been conducted. Among the respondents who were asked the question, Mr. Trump led by six points, compared with the even race across the three surveys over all. Most of the respondents were in Texas. These voters said they trusted Mr. Trump over Mr. Biden to choose the next Supreme Court Justice by a six-point margin — the same as his overall lead among those respondents. This Republican-leaning group also preferred that the winner of the presidential election choose the next Supreme Court justice, rather than have Mr. Trump appoint the next justice before the election, by a 12-point margin. Yet at the same time, the results suggested that Mr. Trump was unlikely to face a serious political cost: By a 14-point margin, the same voters thought the Senate should act on any Trump nominee before the election. — Nate Cohn MILWAUKEE — For 15 years, Johnny Miller worked the polls at a church on Milwaukee’s North Side. He was born in Mississippi, where, he said, his family was terrorized by the Ku Klux Klan for attempting to cast ballots. This background makes him feel “a deep historical tie with trying to get people to vote.” In 2020, he is aware of a different threat when it comes to working the polls: the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Miller, who is 70 and has a heart condition, said the risk was too high. Ten of his friends have died from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. The pandemic is making voting more complicated, with higher stakes. But, activists note, it’s just one more thing to worry about on top of strict identification and mail-in ballot laws that can disproportionately make it difficult for eligible low-income voters, and Black and Latino voters, to cast their ballots. In 2016, President Trump won Wisconsin by just 23,000 votes — the first time a Republican presidential candidate carried the state since 1984. Turnout was down that year by almost 19 percent for Black voters and 6 percent for Latino voters, which is part of the reason turnout groups are focused on those populations this year. Polls show a close race between Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Trump, but disapproval by a majority of Mr. Trump’s handling of the virus. Across the city’s predominantly Black North Side and Latino South Side, organizers and activists are registering new voters and helping others navigate the system. “Black people have been intimidated not to vote since we were three-fifths of a man,” Mr. Miller said, referring to a clause in the original U.S. Constitution. He described a lack of voter education which, in his view, has led to disenfranchisement in the North as a “a different form of Jim Crow.” — Alyssa Schukar Boston’s 2021 mayoral race heated up further on Thursday with the announcement that Andrea Campbell, the first Black woman to serve as City Council president, will enter the race, presumably challenging the city’s popular incumbent and a fellow Democrat, Mayor Marty Walsh. Ms. Campbell is the second woman to enter the race for a position that has only ever been occupied by white men. City Councilor Michelle Wu, a protégé of Senator Elizabeth Warren and a favorite of city progressives, entered the race last week. Unlike Ms. Wu, Ms. Campbell, 38, is a native of Boston. She spent her childhood bouncing among foster families, often on public assistance, as her father served a prison sentence before thriving in Boston’s public schools and attending Princeton University. She served as deputy legal counsel in the administration of Gov. Deval Patrick. Ms. Campbell has focused heavily on the issues of policing and racial injustice, returning often to the painful story of her twin brother, Andre, who served a series of prison terms and died in pretrial custody, at 29, of an untreated illness. “How did two twins born and raised in the city of Boston have such different outcomes?” she said last week. “It started with a story. My brother continues to be my inspiration, he gives me that oomph.” Ms. Campbell faces an uphill battle against her two rivals. Mr. Walsh, who has yet to declare a run for a third term, has received high marks for his handling of the coronavirus, and enjoys the considerable benefits of incumbency in Boston. No incumbent mayor has been defeated in this city since 1949. — Ellen Barry Corey Johnson, the New York City Council speaker and a presumed front-runner in the 2021 contest to replace Mayor Bill de Blasio, withdrew from the mayoral race on Thursday. “This challenging time has led me to rethink how I can best be of service to this city,” he said in a statement, “and I have come to the conclusion that this is not the right path for me.” Mr. Johnson’s exit reflects how the country’s largest city has been upended in six months — economically, socially and politically — by the coronavirus pandemic and Black Lives Matter protests. No one knows when or how the city, which has so many offices, restaurants and businesses still empty, will fully return to its paces, or whether people will feel comfortable on crowded subway trains or sidewalks. What seems clearer is that formidable challenges await the city’s next mayor, with tax revenue dropping, multi-billion-dollar budget gaps looming, and a pressure campaign to de-emphasize or defund the police that modest cuts in the police budget did not defuse. The fight over police funding took a toll on Mr. Johnson, who had pledged to cut $1 billion from the police budget. By late June, it became clear that divisions on the Council would make it impossible to do so, leaving Mr. Johnson apologetic and near tears. Mr. Johnson, 38, who won a following by casting himself as the spirited antithesis to the often aloof Mayor de Blasio, is prevented by term limits from seeking a third consecutive term on the Council, but has not ruled out a future run for another office such as Congress. Mr. Johnson, who is white, was considered to be among three leading candidates, all Democrats, to replace Mr. de Blasio. The others were Eric Adams, the borough president of Brooklyn who is Black, and the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, who is white. The recent congressional primary victories in the New York City area of three candidates of color — all three Black and Latino, and two of them gay — may signal that Democratic voters might be more receptive to someone other than a white man. Still, Mr. Stringer, who officially announced his candidacy earlier this month, may be the prime beneficiary of Mr. Johnson’s decision not to run: The two were thought to appeal to similar swaths of voters. — Jeffery C.
