A third surge of coronavirus infections has now firmly taken hold across much of the United States. Cuomo says N.Y. won’t enforce restrictions on three neighbors, after confusion over quarantine for Pennsylvania travelers. Massachusetts study finds no rise in suicide during pandemic lockdown. Manchester will be put under Britain’s highest level of alert as European countries ratchet up restrictions. All 62 residents of a Kansas nursing home caught the virus in two weeks. India’s Modi calls for vigilance against the virus as the Hindu festival season approaches. McConnell advises White House not to strike pre-election stimulus deal with Pelosi. KEY DATA OF THE DAY In Ohio, more people are hospitalized with the coronavirus than at any other time during the pandemic.  North Dakota, which is leading the nation in coronavirus cases per capita, reported more than 1,000 cases on Tuesday, the state’s worst daily total yet. And as of Monday, 16 states had added more cases in the prior week than in any other seven-day stretch. After weeks of spread and warnings in certain areas, a third surge of coronavirus infections has now firmly taken hold across much of the United States. The latest wave — which is raging most acutely in the Midwest and West, but is also spreading in various areas around the country — threatens to be the worst of the pandemic yet. Its arrival comes as cooler weather is forcing people indoors, setting up a grueling winter that will test the discipline of many Americans who have grown weary of wearing masks and turning down invitations to see family and friends. Over the past week, the country has averaged about 59,000 new cases a day, the most since the beginning of August. The daily total could soon surpass 75,687, a record previously set on July 16. The high case count — which has so far not translated to soaring deaths — in part reflects increased testing. With about 1 million people tested on many days, the country is getting a far more accurate picture of how widely the virus has spread than it did in the spring. But the latest developments also reflect a serious new level of the outbreak. Hospitalizations, the most accurate picture of how many people are seriously sick from the virus, are on the rise nationwide, worrying many public health officials. And a rise in deaths tends to lag behind a spike in cases. Deaths among hospitalized patients have also dropped from 25.6 percent in the spring to 7.6 percent, according to one study. That may be because doctors have better treatments at hand, and the patients are younger and in better health on average than those in the first wave. Still, Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota, recently offered an ominous warning: with infections rising and compliance eroding, he said, “the next six to 12 weeks are going to be the darkest of the entire pandemic.” — Sarah Mervosh, Mitch Smith and Apoorva Mandavilli Despite an uptick of coronavirus cases in New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, New York officials said on Tuesday that travelers from those three neighboring states would not be required to quarantine, though each state meets the qualifications for the restriction. The announcement came with no small amount of confusion: A senior adviser to the governor confirmed that Pennsylvania would be added to the quarantine list, and Mr. Cuomo later indicated in a news conference that New Jersey and Connecticut would not be required to quarantine, but he did not initially mention Pennsylvania. But the governor later clarified in a statement that enforcement from Pennsylvania would also be too difficult to maintain, considering the vast number of people who cross the state’s northern border into New York and its eastern border into New Jersey. That rationale was also articulated by Mr. Cuomo in reference to Connecticut and New Jersey, two neighbors to New York that have worked together for months to try to coordinate response to the coronavirus crisis. “There is no practical way to quarantine New York from New Jersey and Connecticut,” Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, said in a morning news conference. “There are just too many interchanges, there are too many interconnections, there are too many people that live in one place and work in the other.” Adding to the confusion, Beth Garvey, special counsel to Mr. Cuomo, said during the morning news conference that New Jersey and Connecticut were both “being added” to the list on Tuesday, despite Mr. Cuomo earlier suggesting they would not be. In a brief aside after Ms. Garvey’s remarks, the governor said “Pennsylvania, we have the same basic issue.” None of the states were on a quarantine list released on Tuesday afternoon by the governor’s office. Still, Mr. Cuomo said that all nonessential travel among New York and the three states should be avoided and promised he would issue more guidance on that point on Wednesday. New York did add two states to its list on Tuesday: Maryland and Arizona. All told, 40 states and territories are now on the travel advisory list, which Mr. Cuomo referred to as “really a bizarre outcome” considering that New York once faced one of the worst outbreaks in the country. On Tuesday, more than 64,200 new cases and at least 517 new deaths were reported in the United States. Over the last week, there have been an average of 59,269 cases per day, an increase of 34 percent from the average two weeks earlier, and fears are growing in New York about a potential second wave. Two weeks ago, Mr. Cuomo closed nonessential businesses in parts of Queens and Brooklyn where positivity rates had spiked. Since late June, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have worked in concert to create a list of states from which travelers to the region are subject to a two-week quarantine. Essential workers have been exempt from the quarantine since it began in June.Other workers who cross state lines have technically been subject to the advisory, but officials have also said that the quarantine is only required by those who spend at least 24 hours in a state on the list — which would exclude most commuters. The quarantine was intended to apply to any person arriving from an area with a positivity rate higher than 10 per 100,000 residents over a 7-day rolling average or an area with a 10 percent or higher positivity rate over a 7-day rolling average. New Jersey has a population of about 8.88 million people, and so anything over an average of about 888 new cases puts the state above that threshold. According to a New York Times database, New Jersey has seen an average of 1,016 cases per day in the last week, an increase of 54 percent from the average two weeks earlier. For Connecticut, the threshold is around 356, and its daily average in the last week was at 378 cases per day. Though New York has seen a significant increase in cases in parts of New York City and its suburbs, its overall positivity rate has remained lower than its neighbors. On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo said the daily rate was 1.32 percent statewide, and 2.91 percent in the so-called “red zones,” areas where he recently imposed severe restrictions as virus hot spots sprang up across the state. Hospitalizations in the state increased by eight, to 942. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that the citywide seven-day average positivity rate was at 1.58 percent. — Jesse McKinley and Michael Gold President Trump and other politicians have repeatedly warned that lockdowns and similar measures could cause at least as much distress as they prevent, in particular by increasing the risk of overdoses and suicides because of economic hardship. But the evidence for that claim is sparse; on Monday, a study posted on Medrxiv, a prepublication site, found that in Massachusetts, the suicide rate during the state’s lengthy stay-at-home advisory last spring remained steady, neither increasing nor decreasing. The analysis is being submitted to a journal; it has not yet undergone peer review. “This narrative that longer stay-at-home policies drive suicides doesn’t bear out,” said Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency medicine physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and the lead author of the study. “At least in a state that had a very long stay-at-home advisory, which, for all intents and purposes, was a shutdown. It was a ghost town here.” Dr. Faust led a team of researchers from Harvard and Yale who compared suicide rates from March to May, when the state was largely shut down, with the rates during the same months in 2019, which were in line with previous years. The team adjusted for background trends (U.S. rates have been increasing steadily for many groups since at least 2008) and for the numbers of deaths still under investigation as possible suicides. The rate this spring was unchanged from previous years — just under one suicide a month per 100,000 people.
