Convention Kicks Off<br></h1><p id="artcont">Andrew Pollack, a Parkland father, tries to portray Biden as a threat to the nation. We’re fact-checking the Republican National Convention. Vernon Jones, a Democratic state legislator, crosses party lines to back Trump. Herschel Walker says he takes claim that Trump is racist as a ‘personal insult.’ Jim Jordan tries to paint Trump as empathetic with a personal story. Ronna McDaniel, ‘a real housewife’ of Michigan, doubles down on a Trump tweet. Kimberly Klacik, whose campaign ad went viral, accuses Democrats of taking Black voters for granted. Arguing Biden would be beholden to the left, Matt Gaetz accuses him of supporting policies he doesn’t back. Charlie Kirk makes a nativist pitch for four more years of Trump. Democrats are ‘using Covid to steal the election,’ Trump says in an inflammatory R.N.C. speech. Mike Pompeo’s convention speech appears to violate rules he sent to State Department employees. Andrew Pollack, whose daughter, Meadow, was killed in the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Fla., praised President Trump’s response to the massacre and argued that Mr. Trump would do a better job than Joe Biden at protecting students from gun violence. Mr. Pollack was the only parent of a Parkland victim to attend the listening session President Trump held at the White House a week after the shooting, and he said in his speech on Monday that the event had shown him that Mr. Trump was “a great listener” who “cuts through the BS.” He praised Mr. Trump’s formation of the Federal Commission on School Safety, which issued recommendations including tighter building security and programs to arm school personnel. The commission endorsed so-called red-flag laws, which allow the temporary confiscation of guns from people deemed to pose an imminent threat to themselves or others, but otherwise did not focus on gun restrictions. “Gun control laws didn’t fail my daughter. People did,” Mr. Pollack said, arguing that Parkland officials’ failure to respond to warnings that the gunman was dangerous was a result of Obama-era policies on school discipline, which emphasized “restorative justice” and aimed to reduce the use of police to handle student discipline. “I was just fine with the old approach to discipline and safety — it was called discipline and safety,” Mr. Pollack said. “But the Obama-Biden administration took Parkland’s bad policies and forced them into schools across America.” Officials’ failure to respond to warnings about the gunman have been extensively documented, but there is no evidence that those failures happened as a direct result of restorative justice policies. After the shooting, Mr. Pollack helped pass a Florida law that, among other measures, allowed some school personnel to be armed. He has also pushed for tighter security, such as metal detectors, in schools. His views set him apart from many other Parkland survivors and victims’ families. Among those who have been politically active, most have aligned themselves with Democrats and groups supporting gun restrictions, which Mr. Pollack opposes. He tweeted on Sunday that Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s proposed policies would leave schools “defenseless.” Fred Guttenberg — whose daughter, Jaime, was also killed in the Parkland shooting — participated in the roll call vote at the Democratic National Convention last week, and many students who survived the shooting have been involved in the March for Our Lives movement for stricter gun laws. — Maggie Astor Our team of reporters who cover the Pentagon, Congress, health care and more are fact checking the speeches on the first night of the Republican National Convention.   See the claims and how they stack up against the truth here.     — The New York Times Vernon Jones, a Black Democratic state representative from Georgia, appeared at the Republican National Convention on Monday night and accused his party of taking Black voters for granted. “The Democratic Party does not want Black people to leave their mental plantation,” Mr. Jones said, according to prepared remarks. “We’ve been forced to be there for decades and generations.” Mr. Jones, who was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 2016, voted twice for George W. Bush and endorsed President Trump in April. He later announced he would not seek another term for his seat. “Now you know, when I made the public announcement of my support for President Trump, all hell broke loose,” Mr. Jones said Monday, according to his prepared remarks. “I was threatened, called an embarrassment, and asked to resign by my own party. Unfortunately, that’s consistent with the Democratic Party and how they view independent-thinking Black men and women.” For decades, polls have shown that an overwhelming majority of Black voters favor Democrats. Mr. Jones was one of several people of color the Trump campaign highlighted on Monday, as the Republican Party tried to portray itself as inclusive despite the president’s continued messaging disparaging African-Americans, Latinos and Muslims. Mr. Jones has been a key surrogate for the Trump campaign in Georgia, which traditionally votes Republican but has emerged as a key target for Democrats in this year’s presidential race. During the 2008 Senate primary, Mr. Jones sent out a campaign mailer picturing himself with Barack Obama, a senator at the time, standing under the presidential campaign slogan “Yes we can!” But Mr. Obama had not backed Mr. Jones, whose career was mired in controversy including an accusation of rape, and the images of the two had been taken from different photos, using digital manipulation to place them on a single background. (No charges were filed related to the rape accusation.) When the mailer caused a stir, Mr. Jones suggested that his Senate bid would give Mr. Obama a lift in Georgia. — Jennifer Medina President Trump has hired the fewest number of Black people to positions of authority in his White House and on his presidential campaign of any chief executive in decades. But convention planners, trying to counter the display of diversity showcased by Democrats last week, have offered airtime to several high-profile people of color this week in an attempt to soften the negative impression voters of all stripes have of his handling of race relations. One of the first such speakers was Herschel Walker, the Heisman Trophy-winning running back Mr. Trump signed to his short-lived United States Football League franchise, the New Jersey Generals, in the early 1980s. The president has remained close with Mr. Walker, a multisport standout who went on to play with the Dallas Cowboys and even dabbled in bobsledding, martial arts and ballet. “It hurts my soul to hear the terrible names that people call Donald — the worst is one ‘racist,’” said Mr. Walker, who grew up in rural Georgia. “I take it as a personal insult that people would think I would have a 37-year friendship with a racist,” he said. “People who think that don’t know what they are talking about. Growing up in the Deep South, I have seen racism up close. I know what it is. And it isn’t Donald Trump.” Last week, Democrats painted a picture of Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a compassionate man full of empathy for those who are hurting. The obvious and unspoken contrast was to President Trump, who only on rare occasions mentions the more than 175,000 people in the United States who have died from the coronavirus and who has a tendency to make statements about the dead largely about himself. On Monday night during the Republican National Convention, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio offered something of a rebuttal: Mr. Trump, he said, can also have empathy, albeit in private and for political allies. Mr. Jordan’s nephew, a college wrestler, was killed two years ago in a car accident, he said. “It was a Saturday morning, three days after the accident,” Mr. Jordan said. “I  walked to the car, to head up to Eli’s parents’ home, when the president called. We talked about a few issues. And then he asked how the family was doing. I said they’re doing ‘OK, but it’s tough.’ ” Mr. Trump, Mr. Jordan said, then spent five minutes speaking to Mr. Jordan’s nephew’s father. Mr. Jordan did not relay any particularly soothing words the president conveyed, but said it helped the family in its mourning. “That’s the president I've gotten to know the last four years,” said Mr. Jordan, who was the president’s chief defender during the impeachment inquiry. “That’s the individual who’s made America great again and who knows America’s best days are still in front of us.” — Reid J. Epstein Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, embraced President Trump’s (in)famous “suburban housewife” tweet at her party’s convention on Monday, describing herself as a proud “housewife” and “mom” who had risen to the top of the G.O.P. on her merits — rather than her gender. “I’m actually a real housewife and a mom from Michigan with two wonderful kids in public school who happens to be only the second woman in 164 years to run the Republican Party,” said Ms. McDaniel, a niece of Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee. She went on to take a swipe at Senator Kamala Harris, the first woman of color to appear on a major party’s ticket. “Unlike Joe Biden, President Trump didn’t choose me because I’m a woman — he chose me because I was the best person for the job,” said Ms. McDaniel, who has sought to marginalize Trump skeptics in the party during her three-plus years at the helm. In her introductory address Monday night, Ms. McDaniel, the former party chairwoman in Michigan and a formidable fund-raiser, blasted Democrats for “talking about how much they despise our president” while revealing “very little about their actual policies.” The Republican Party does not have a new platform this year, for the first time in recent memory. Instead, the convention over which Ms. McDaniel presides unanimously adopted a resolution that simply expressed “the party’s strong support for President Donald Trump” and his administration. Ms. McDaniel, echoing the combative culture-war theme struck by the president, took aim at the quartet of actresses and activists who hosted the Democrats’ slickly produced digital convention — and rejected the notion that her candidate was destined to lose the empathy war against Mr. Biden. “Their argument for Joe Biden boiled down to the fact that they think he’s a nice guy,” she said. “In the nearly four years I’ve worked on behalf of President Trump, I’ve seen up close a man who has a deep love for family,” she went on. “A man who has reverence for the office of the presidency. A man with an incredible respect for law enforcement and our military. I’ve seen private moments where he comforts Americans in times of pain and sadness.” — Glenn Thrush Kimberly Klacik, the Republican candidate in a solidly Democratic congressional district in Maryland, appeared on a national convention stage just a week after her first introduction to a national audience and accused Democrats of destroying cities and taking Black voters for granted. “Abandoned buildings, liquor stores on every corner, drug addicts and guns on the street — that is now the norm in many neighborhoods,” she said of Baltimore, part of which is in Maryland’s Seventh Congressional District, where she is running. “Sadly, this same cycle of decay exists in many of America’s Democrat-run cities. And yet, the Democrats still assume that Black people will vote for them, no matter how much they let us down and take us for granted.” Her description of parts of Baltimore was reminiscent of President Trump’s, who last year described the Seventh District as a “disgusting, rat- and rodent-infested mess” where “no human being would want to live.” That was part of a racist attack by Mr. Trump on the district’s representative at the time, Elijah Cummings, who died last year. In her speech on Monday, Ms. Klacik, who is Black, continued: “Joe Biden believes we can’t think for ourselves — that the color of someone’s skin dictates their political views. We’re not buying the lies anymore. You and your party have neglected us for far too long.” Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Black voters plan to vote for Mr. Biden, who won the Democratic primary on the strength of their support. The district where Ms. Klacik is running is 26 percentage points more Democratic than the nation as a whole, according to the Cook Partisan Voting Index, and it is not considered competitive. Mr. Cummings held the seat for more than 20 years. But Ms. Klacik was invited to speak at the convention after one of her campaign ads — in which she made largely the same arguments she made in her speech — went viral. — Maggie Astor In just two terms in Congress, Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida has become one of President Trump’s highest-profile surrogates, thanks to his relentless efforts defending Mr. Trump on cable television. Mr. Gaetz, as much as any member of Congress, has channeled the spirit of Trumpism, and on Monday night he delivered a series of searing yet baseless attacks on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Biden, Mr. Gaetz argued, would be a mere avatar of the Democratic Party’s left wing, beholden to supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders — whom Mr. Biden handily defeated in the Democratic presidential primary. “It’s a horror film, really,” he said. “They’ll disarm you, empty the prisons, lock you in your home, and invite MS-13 to live next door. And the defunded police aren’t on their way.” Mr. Biden, of course, does not support any of those things. While he has called for putting in place universal background checks on new gun purchases and banning assault-style weapons, Mr. Biden did not support the confiscation of existing weapons when it was proposed by former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas last year. And Mr. Biden supports spending more money on law enforcement, not less. For Mr. Gaetz, using the national convention stage to attack Mr. Biden is his latest effort to not just defend Mr. Trump but also attack the president’s enemies. Mr. Gaetz was an early and regular aggressor toward Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign’s ties to Russia; he threatened Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former fixer, a day before Mr. Cohen was to testify before the House Oversight Committee; and he mocked early coronavirus precautions by wearing a gas mask during a House debate on funding to address the pandemic. In June, Twitter affixed a warning label to a tweet of Mr. Gaetz’s for glorifying violence after he wrote: “Now that we clearly see Antifa as terrorists, can we hunt them down like we do those in the Middle East?” But Mr. Gaetz did little to talk up Mr. Trump during his convention speech, beyond calling him a “visionary.” His pitch for a second Trump term amounted to little more than tearing into Mr. Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, while acknowledging that Mr. Trump isn’t always what people expect to see in a president. “President Trump sometimes raises his voice — and a ruckus,” Mr. Gaetz said. “He knows that’s what it takes to raise an army of patriots who love America and will protect her.” — Reid J. Epstein Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative group Turning Point USA and a staunch defender of President Trump online, said at the Republican National Convention on Monday night that the coming election posed a threat to “Western civilization,” framing his support of Mr. Trump in the same nativist spirit that powered the president’s 2016 election. “I am here tonight to tell you — to warn you — that this election is a decision between preserving America as we know it, and eliminating everything that we love,” Mr. Kirk said. In a laudatory speech, Mr. Kirk praised Mr. Trump as the “the bodyguard of Western civilization,” repeatedly invoking his own Christian faith and claiming the country’s creation was “centered around central biblical ideals,” despite the fact that the First Amendment of the Constitution expressly prohibits a national religion. Few speakers embody the social-media-fueled, Trump-aligned conservative industrial complex more than Mr. Kirk. Now 26, he founded Turning Point USA in 2012, when he was just 18, and it became one of many groups courting young conservatives. But his rapid embrace of Mr. Trump during the 2016 election quickly turned Turning Point USA into a sprawling pro-Trump enterprise and made Mr. Kirk a favorite of the president’s. He consistently garnered retweets from Mr. Trump and built an audience of more than 1.8 million followers on Twitter. Mr. Kirk has leaned into the provocative, sometimes inflammatory nature of Mr. Trump’s brand of politics, with occasional falsehoods and misrepresentations. “All of this is under attack by a group of bitter, deceitful, vengeful, arrogant activists who wish to tear down this gift we have been given,” Mr. Kirk said on Monday. He spoke of “monuments,” though he didn’t directly refer to the conservative push to preserve Confederate statues. He also spoke of “kicking doctors off of social media,” though he didn’t mention that this had happened because they had spread dangerous disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. — Nick Corasaniti President Trump was nominated for a second term on Monday as the Republican National Convention got underway in Charlotte, N.C., and he used a surprise speech at the convention not to preview a second-term agenda, but to cast doubt in advance on the November election and attack mail-in voting, accusing Democrats of “using Covid to steal the election.” Mr. Trump — who took the stage as the crowd chanted “Four more years!” — began with a provocation. “If you want to really drive them crazy, you say 12 more years,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump, who is seeking re-election amid a pandemic that his administration has failed to contain, widespread economic pain and racial unrest, used his speech to rally the party by focusing on the strength of the stock market and attacking Democratic officials who imposed coronavirus restrictions. He repeated his unfounded allegations that President Barack Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., his opponent in the coming election, had spied on his campaign in 2016. “We caught them doing really bad things,” he said. “Let’s see what happens. They’re trying it again.” Mr. Trump criticized Roy Cooper, the Democratic governor of North Carolina, telling the crowd in Charlotte that Mr. Cooper and other Democratic governors had enacted virus restrictions simply to hurt his re-election chances and would lift them after Election Day. “You have a governor who is in a total shutdown mood,” he said. “I guarantee you on November 4, it will all open up.” Though shutdowns caused by the pandemic have left millions of Americans unemployed, and new rounds of relief have been held up in Washington, Mr. Trump focused on his economic successes. “We’re just about ready to break the all-time stock market record,” he said. Mr. Trump offered his remarks to a crowd that frequently broke into applause, a dramatic contrast with last week’s Democratic convention, which was held largely remotely out of concerns that indoor gatherings could spread the coronavirus. The Republicans have made their decision to hold an in-person convention a political statement in itself. With tens of millions of Americans expected to vote by mail in order to avoid contracting the virus at polling places, the president continued his monthslong assault on voting by mail and repeated unfounded accusations that it was part of a Democratic plot to hand the election to Mr. Biden. “They’re using Covid to steal the election,” he said. And he continued to try to paint Mr. Biden, an establishment figure in politics for decades who has been running a centrist campaign, as radical. He demanded that Mr. Biden put out a list of judges he would appoint, as Mr. Trump did in 2016. “He can’t do it,” he said. “The radical left will demand he appoints super-radical-left wild crazy justices going into the Supreme Court.” If that happens, Mr. Trump said, “Your American dream will be dead.” While the Democrats at their convention last week made the death toll from the pandemic — now past 175,000 — a centerpiece of their case, and tried to lay the blame for it at Mr. Trump’s feet, the president mentioned the virus’s victims almost as an afterthought at the end of his rambling, nearly hourlong speech. “We will never forget the 175,000 people — that will go up,” he said, adding the toll would have been millions more without travel bans he implemented. — Annie Karni and Michael Cooper Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Monday called for an immediate investigation into the shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, by the police in Kenosha, Wis., saying that “these shots pierce the soul of our nation.” “This morning, the nation wakes up yet again with grief and outrage that yet another Black American is a victim of excessive force,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. “This calls for an immediate, full and transparent investigation and the officers must be held accountable.” Mr. Biden added that the country “must dismantle systemic racism,” saying that “equal justice has not been real for Black Americans and so many others.” Policing has emerged as an issue in the presidential campaign, particularly after the killing of George Floyd in police custody in May incited protests around the nation. As Republicans gathered in Charlotte, N.C., for their convention on Monday, Vice President Mike Pence told the delegates that “four more years means more support for our troops and our cops.” And President Trump’s pledge to the delegates that “we are going to fully fund law enforcement and hire more police” was greeted with chants and cheers. — Thomas Kaplan and Michael Cooper Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is scheduled to speak at the Republican convention on Tuesday, instructed State Department employees last month not to participate in political activities, and his own plans appear to violate department regulations. Employees “may not engage in partisan political activity” even outside of work hours, Mr. Pompeo wrote in an internal cable on July 24. “Similarly,” he added, “presidential and political appointees” — of which he is one — “are subject to significant restrictions on their political activity; they may not engage in any partisan political activity in concert with a partisan campaign, political party, or partisan political group, even on personal time and outside of the federal workplace.” According to State Department guidance from December 2019, department employees are not allowed to “speak for or against a partisan candidate, political party, or partisan political group at a convention, rally, or similar gathering sponsored by such entities.” A State Department official said that Mr. Pompeo would “address the convention in his personal capacity” and added: “No State Department resources will be used. Staff are not involved in preparing the remarks or in the arrangements for Secretary Pompeo’s appearance. The State Department will not bear any costs in conjunction with this appearance.” But the official guidelines and Mr. Pompeo’s cable state clearly that such partisan activities are prohibited even on employees’ personal time. The guidance also says that “Senate-confirmed presidential appointees may not even attend a political party convention or convention-related event.” Mr. Pompeo is a Senate-confirmed presidential appointee. Mr. Pompeo will not be physically present at the convention, which is being held in Charlotte, N.C., but speaking for Mr. Trump would violate the December 2019 guidance. State Department representatives did not respond to multiple requests for comment about whether those rules were current. — Maggie Astor and Lara Jakes Vice President Mike Pence took the stage to accept his renomination Monday morning as the Republican National Convention kicked off, pitching the Trump-Pence ticket as leaders of a party that stood for “free market economics, secure borders” and the “right to life.” “We’re going to Make America Great Again, again,” Mr. Pence told the crowd of cheering — but socially distanced — delegates at the Charlotte Convention Center. He said the week would make it clear that the president will “always stand with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement.” “Four more years means more judges,” Mr. Pence said. “Four more years means more support for our troops and our cops. It’s going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp.” Rebutting the Democrats’ charge that the Nov. 3 election amounted to a referendum on democracy itself, Mr. Pence told the delegates, “the economy is on the ballot.” Mr. Pence’s speech came as delegates formally cast their votes for Mr. Trump at the opening-day roll call. Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, offered opening remarks in which she framed Mr. Trump as the empathetic candidate on the ballot, in contrast with his opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr. Ms. McDaniel said last week’s Democratic convention was “depressing, doom and gloom, night after night,” calling it “a masterpiece in fiction about President Trump’s record and what he has accomplished for the American people.” “Their argument for Joe Biden boiled down to the fact they think he’s a nice and empathetic guy,” she said. “Well, let me tell you, raising taxes on 82 percent of Americans is not empathetic.” She seemed to be referring to Mr. Biden’s vow to undo President Trump’s signature 2017 tax cut, which resulted in lower taxes for middle-income earners as well as the wealthy. Mr. Biden pledged on Sunday that if elected he would hold the line on taxes for Americans earning under $400,000. — Annie Karni Jerry Falwell Jr. played a major role at the Republican National Convention four years ago, serving as a critical bridge between conservative evangelical voters and a Republican nominee who was thrice divorced, enamored of expletive, iffy on biblical verse, and a one-time Democrat who had proudly declared himself  “pro-choice in every respect” before changing positions and parties. “My family has grown to love and respect the Trumps,” Mr. Falwell, then the president of Liberty University, said in a seven-minute speech before a packed convention hall in Cleveland. “We have never met such a genuine and loving family. I truly believe Mr. Trump is America’s blue-collar billionaire.” A return speaking role seemed inevitable after Mr. Falwell hosted the president for the university’s commencement in 2017, and the earliest discussions of the 2020 convention lineup did, indeed, include him, according to a Trump campaign official. But convention planners quietly ruled him out late last year, amid concerns about Mr. Falwell’s private life — long before Monday’s blockbuster report by Reuters alleging a long-term romantic entanglement between himself, his wife and pool attendant, according to three people familiar with the situation. As of late Monday, Mr. Falwell was on his way out as president of Liberty University, which he had taken a leave of absence from earlier after posting a suggestive picture of himself on social media. Like many other one-time fixtures in Mr. Trump’s political orbit, Mr. Falwell has been shunted to the margins when he became a liability, in part because the president does not need anyone’s help in securing support from white evangelicals, who are now among his most faithful voters. But Mr. Falwell and the president were once very close — close enough for Mr. Falwell to ask Mr. Trump’s now-estranged personal lawyer Michael Cohen to suppress “personal” photographs “between husband and wife,” according to a taped conversation between the two. Mr. Falwell’s 2016 speech, viewed in light of subsequent events, seems like a snapshot from a different era — and even his predictions about Mr. Trump’s presidency-to-be now seem dated. Mr. Trump would work his “magic” on “$19 trillion in debt,” he said. It now stands at roughly $26 trillion.  — Glenn Thrush Television’s ability to handle a Trump-centric convention faced an early test on Monday, when the president delivered a kickoff speech that was filled with false claims about the integrity of mail-in voting and the policy positions of his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr. Broadcasters were already bracing for a week of tough editorial decisions. Political conventions, at heart, are forms of propaganda, and TV networks typically give a long leash to candidates as they formally make their case to the nation. But President Trump’s well-documented penchant for falsehoods presents a unique challenge, according to network executives. Producers are trying to balance voters’ right to hear directly from their president while preventing misinformation from spreading unchecked on their channels to millions of viewers. The president’s allies say that Mr. Trump deserves the same deference as past presidents, and any intervention on the networks’ part is a sign of editorial bias. As the president spoke on Monday, a hodgepodge of journalistic strategies emerged. CNN cut away from Mr. Trump in the middle of his remarks. MSNBC carried the entirety of Mr. Trump’s speech live, opting for real-time analysis in on-screen graphics. Fox News carried the speech live, but did not offer a correction to Mr. Trump’s false claims. In general, TV producers say they are inclined to air Mr. Trump’s remarks live, with clarifications and corrections offered as necessary. “There are certain speeches in the political life of the country that the news networks treat as events the audience deserves to see: the State of the Union, an inaugural address, and convention speeches by the nominee and the running mate,” said Mark Lukasiewicz, who was an executive producer for coverage of six conventions at NBC News. “These are singular events,” Mr. Lukasiewicz added. “But the networks are going to struggle. How do you maintain an appearance of fairness and equity between the two parties’ political events, but deal with the fact that one candidate, you have every reason to believe, will not tell the truth?” — Michael M. Grynbaum The extent to which President Trump has bent the Republican Party to his will was underscored this week when the party announced that it would not adopt a new platform this year, but would “continue to enthusiastically support the president’s America-first agenda.” The decision not to adopt a new Republican Party platform, the party’s main statement of policy, was extraordinary. The resolution that the Republican National Committee passed over the weekend forgoing a new one anticipated criticism, claiming that the “media has outrageously misrepresented the implications” of not adopting a new platform and calling on the media to accurately report the party’s “strong support” for the president. Criticism came swiftly. William Kristol, a former chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle who went on to serve as the editor of The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, and who has emerged as one of Mr. Trump’s most prominent Republican critics, wrote on Twitter: “It’s no longer the Republican party. It’s a Trump cult.” The Republicans, in 2020, for the first time, have no platform. Instead: "RESOLVED, That the Republican Party has and will continue to enthusiastically support the President’s America-first agenda." It's no longer the Republican party. It's a Trump cult.https://t.co/BATeUiXRYu Party platforms are nonbinding documents that tend to lay out policy positions and principles. A new Republican Party platform would have been instructive at a moment when Mr. Trump has broken with party orthodoxy on a host of issues, including his opposition to free trade agreements; a foreign policy that has attempted to forge closer ties with Russia even as he has antagonized longstanding European allies; and a fiscal policy under which deficits were rising even before the pandemic forced more federal spending. The Republican National Committee said that it was forgoing a new platform because fewer people were attending the convention this year because of coronavirus restrictions, and it “did not want a small contingent of delegates formulating a new platform without the breadth of perspectives within the ever-growing Republican movement.” The Democrats, who held their convention remotely, nonetheless adopted a new platform last week. On Sunday, Mr. Trump released a list of broad statements about his agenda for a second term, under the heading “President Trump: Fighting for You!” They included promises of millions of new jobs, a vow to “hold China fully accountable for allowing the virus to spread around the world” and a “return to normal in 2021.” — Michael Cooper The Republican National Convention is underway, and President Trump plans to speak during each of its four nights this week.
