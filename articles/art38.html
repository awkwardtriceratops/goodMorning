U.S. voters are picking a president during one of the most alarming stretches of the pandemic. Trump will be in charge of the U.S. pandemic response until at least January. Experts are worried. Birx suggests the White House has spent too much time on preventing lockdowns and not enough on controlling the virus. The University of Wisconsin cancels another football game as 27 people test positive. How do you run a polling site during a pandemic? With lots of masks, for starters. This is what voting looks like in 2020: Flags, masks and face shields. The virus has turned a Navajo Nation family’s life ‘upside down.’ As Americans vote on Tuesday, they do so in the midst of a rapidly escalating coronavirus outbreak that is concentrated in some of the very states that are likely to decide the presidential race. One of the most alarming periods of the virus has arrived just as voters pick a president, and reflects one of the most significant challenges that whoever wins the election will face: More than 93,000 cases were announced across the country on Monday, a higher total than every day of the pandemic except Friday. More than 20 states have set weekly case records, and more than 40 states are seeing a pattern of growing known infections. On Tuesday, hospitalizations in the United States topped 50,000 for the first time since Aug. 7. As of Monday, the seven-day average of new cases across the United States reached its highest point yet, with more than 85,000 a day. More than 598,000 total cases were reported in the seven days ending Monday in a nation seeing nearly 8 percent unemployment and mourning the virus-related deaths of more than 231,000 people. Four out of five Americans say they feel nervous about the country’s future. The situation is especially dire in the political battleground of Wisconsin, where more than 100,000 cases have been identified in the last month and where spiraling cases show no signs of slowing. Areas around Wausau, in northern Wisconsin, and around Beaver Dam and Fond du Lac, in the eastern part of the state, have among the worst trendlines in the nation. Deaths and hospitalizations in Wisconsin have also spiked, and many fear there could be worse news ahead, even as some patients are already being taken to a field hospital at the state fairgrounds outside Milwaukee. Andrea Palm, the secretary-designee for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, said recently that the outbreak’s devastation was vast. “It is taxing public health,” Ms. Palm said. “It is taxing our health care systems.” Across the political battlegrounds of the Midwest and Great Lakes, the outlook on the virus is almost uniformly grim. Michigan, a key target for both presidential campaigns, has averaged more than 3,500 cases a day over the last week. On Tuesday, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Minnesota set their own new daily case records. Iowa and Nebraska have also been reporting cases near their highest levels yet. “We are at a record number of hospitalizations — 613 — and that means we need people to pay special attention to washing their hands often, wearing a mask, keeping that six foot of distance,” Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska said on Monday. Both presidential candidates see an opening to win a single electoral vote in the Omaha area. In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine wrote an open letter to residents this week, asking both for patience during the voting process and continued diligence in fighting the virus, which he described as “an enemy that is relentless and clearly on the march” and that “cares not whether we voted for Donald Trump or Joe Biden.” “As we confront this new enemy, time is not on our side,” Mr. DeWine said. “We must focus. We must rally together.” — Mitch Smith Regardless of the election’s outcome this week, President Trump will be the one steering the country through what is likely to be the darkest and potentially deadliest period of the coronavirus pandemic, and he has largely excluded the nation’s leading health experts from his inner circle. Mr. Trump will still have control of the nation’s health apparatus and the bully pulpit that comes with the Oval Office until Jan. 20, as infections are expected to crest over 100,000 a day and death rates begin to rise as hospitals are strained to their breaking points. But the president has largely shuttered the White House Coronavirus Task Force and increased his use of anti-science rhetoric, telling voters that the country is “rounding the corner” in the fight against the virus that has claimed nearly a quarter of a million lives. Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, was reduced to issuing an urgent plea on Monday for an “aggressive balanced approach that is not being implemented,” in a memo that was promptly leaked to The Washington Post. All of this has epidemiologists and infectious-disease experts extremely worried. “Even if Biden wins, we still have several months of the Trump administration in which the epidemic is at its worst,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert at Emory University, referring to the president’s Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr. “He’s given up, he has basically implied, ‘I don’t care about this,’ and he has turned it over to the governors.” — Michael D. Shear and Sheryl Gay Stolberg Dr. Deborah L. Birx, who has carefully straddled the line between science and politics as she helps lead the Trump administration’s coronavirus response, delivered a stark private warning on Monday, telling White House officials that the pandemic is entering a new and “deadly phase” that demands a more aggressive approach. The warning, contained in a private memo to White House officials as the nation’s daily coronavirus caseload has broken records and approached 100,000, amounted to a direct contradiction of President Trump’s repeated — and inaccurate — assertions that the pandemic is “rounding the corner.” In the memo, Dr. Birx suggested that Mr. Trump and his advisers were spending too much time focusing on preventing lockdowns and not enough time on controlling the virus. “We are entering the most concerning and most deadly phase of this pandemic,” Dr. Birx wrote, adding: “This is not about lockdowns — it hasn’t been about lockdowns since March or April. It’s about an aggressive balanced approach that is not being implemented.” The memo’s existence was reported earlier by The Washington Post. A top White House official who has seen it confirmed its contents. The blunt message was a striking one for Dr. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, who at least in public has taken care not to criticize the president or his administration. Her sharp critique reflects a growing concern among government scientists and public health experts that the worst of the pandemic is yet to come. Dr. Birx, a respected AIDS researcher, was named the coronavirus response coordinator in March. The job has required her to manage the work of the White House coronavirus task force, tracking and orchestrating the government’s effort to contain the outbreak. In the early days of the pandemic, she projected a calm, authoritative presence — and a steady counterpoint to the mixed messages from Mr. Trump. But her tendency to remain silent as the president spread misinformation has hurt her reputation, and some of her old allies in the AIDS advocacy world have turned against her, saying openly that she has lost credibility in their eyes. — Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Maggie Haberman  For the second consecutive week, the University of Wisconsin has canceled a football game because of a coronavirus outbreak within its tenth-ranked team. Wisconsin said Tuesday that it would not host Purdue University on Saturday, less than two weeks after the football program began to see a surge of cases. Wisconsin reported Tuesday that at least 27 players and staff members, including Coach Paul Chryst, had tested positive since Oct. 24. “I share in the disappointment of our student-athletes and staff,” Barry Alvarez, Wisconsin’s athletic director, said in a statement on Tuesday. “We have seen a level of improvement in our testing numbers, but not enough to give us confidence to resume normal activities and play our game on Saturday.” “We will continue to test regularly, take the proper health-related precautions and look forward to getting our team back on the field as soon as possible,” he added. The infections on and around the football team have played out as the state as a whole has confronted some of its most wrenching weeks of the pandemic. Statewide, about 245,000 people have tested positive for the virus, and more than 2,100 people have died, many of them in October, according to a New York Times database. Wisconsin, which had already canceled a game at the University of Nebraska, will play no more than six regular-season games before the Big Ten Conference’s championship matchup is set. Under the league’s rules, the run of cancellations leaves Wisconsin, the only ranked team in the Big Ten’s West Division, close to ineligibility for the conference’s title game. (The threshold, though, could change if more of the league’s games are canceled this season.) More than three dozen top-tier college football games have been postponed or canceled for virus-related reasons since late August. The Big Ten said in August that it would not play this fall, but it reversed its decision in September and began competition in October. — Alan Blinder  John Elway, the former Denver Broncos quarterback who is now the team’s general manager and president of football operations, has tested positive for the virus, along with the team’s president and chief executive, Joe Ellis, the team said in a statement on Tuesday. Mr. Elway had been at UCHealth Training Center, the Broncos practice facility, on Monday morning, but left “after experiencing minor symptoms that he quickly brought to the attention of our medical staff,” the statement said. Mr. Elway retired in 1999 after winning two straight Super Bowl victories with the Broncos. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2004. Mr. Ellis did not feel well on Sunday morning and watched Sunday’s game against the Los Angeles Chargers from home, the team said, and then worked from home on Monday. The team said that both men were experiencing only mild symptoms and would continue to work from home in isolation. “Based on a review of contact-tracing data with the league, we are confident these cases originated independently outside team facilities,” the team said, adding that the two men had “minimal close contacts,” none of whom were players or coaches. “It’s certainly a concerning situation for us,” Dr. Allen Sills, the N.F.L.’s chief medical officer, said on Tuesday. “We know that there are areas of the country where it is spiking and increases vulnerability.” He added that the league had not seen positive cases on teams rise as quickly as in the general populace. Colorado, which once looked like it had gotten a grip on the coronavirus, has slipped. Daily reports of new cases are soaring to record heights, and the number of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 has tripled since early September. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment is now warning that hospitalizations in the state are likely to blast through the peaks of last April and could overwhelm the state’s intensive care units by January. The department estimated that one in every 219 people in Colorado is infectious. “It’s really a very scary rise,” Dr. Jonathan Samet, the dean of the Colorado School of Public Health, said in an interview. “Clearly, Coloradans have lapsed.” — Kate Taylor, Ken Belson and Jack Healy Poll workers are scrubbing down voting machines before and after each ballot. Voters are being asked to bring their own pens. And, in some states, officials are sending polling places hundreds of thousands of gloves, masks and social-distancing markers. Those are among the precautions being taken as voters in the United States fan out to the polls on Tuesday in the midst of a surge of coronavirus infections that has swamped hospitals and set daily records for new cases in some states. The efforts are intended not only to keep voters and poll workers from becoming infected, but also to make it safe for people who are already sick or isolating to vote, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said over the weekend. The agency said that those people have a right to vote, too. It recommended that voters keep at least six feet from others and issued a six-step guide to help people prepare for voting. Among the suggestions: Bring your own supplies, including two masks, tissues, hand sanitizer with 60 percent alcohol, water and a black ink pen. “You should also let poll workers know that you are sick or in quarantine when you arrive at the polling station,” the center said. In sending voters to the polls in the middle of an uncontrolled outbreak, the United States is trying an experiment that few other countries have attempted. More than 60 countries have postponed votes since the outbreak first took hold, the Council on Foreign Relations has said, while those that did hold elections have struggled to make them safe. The C.D.C. guidelines align with measures that many polling stations around the country are taking to keep safe on Tuesday. Paul Pate, the secretary of state for Iowa, said that his office had distributed 145,000 gloves, 200,000 masks and 11,000 social-distancing markers to be used by voters and poll workers.In Virginia, one city official said that plexiglass was being erected and that personal protection equipment would be distributed to anyone entering the polling station. The state of Ohio has also purchased personal protection equipment, including clear shields, to protect voters and poll workers. Voting machines are to be cleaned before and after each vote, according to a Dayton news station. The Illinois Department of Public Health issued its own Election Day guidelines to polling locations. The agency recommended having separate entrances and exits if possible and replacing shared objects like pens with single-use items. Oakland, Calif., was able to augment its gloves-and-mask protections for poll workers and voters by providing plenty of ventilation: Blue skies and sunshine allowed the location at the Alameda County Courthouse to move voting outside. — Derrick Bryson Taylor and Benjamin Mueller UNIVERSITY PARK, Texas — Mask-wearing became a flash point at a polling site in the middle of Dallas, where the election official in charge of overseeing balloting, along with at least three poll workers, did not wear face coverings. The Democratic Party said it had received complaints from voters earlier on Tuesday and called it a willful effort to discourage people from voting at the location. But the polling official, Beth Biesel, said there had been no complaints from voters, only from “professional agitators.” Outside the polling place at University Park United Methodist Church in the afternoon, a trickle of voters arrived, nearly all of them wearing masks. But one of the election workers, Patrick Nugent, 51, stood at the door without a mask while handing out disposable styluses for voters to use to touch the voting screens. “I’m not 80 years old and in a nursing home,” he said. A Democratic poll watcher at the polling site, Ruth Torres, wore a face shield and two masks: one was a surgical-style mask, the other made of black cloth featuring a silver rhinestone cross and the word “Faith.” She said that the alternate Democratic poll watcher left the polling site when Ms. Biesel showed up without a mask. “We’ve had no voters complain, but we’ve had professional agitators causing a lot of hostility and trouble for us, the workers,” said Ms. Biesel, 62, and that people had been yelling at her to put on a mask. In response, she called the sheriff and reported that she felt “very unsafe here.” She said that she was simply following an order from Gov. Greg Abbott, which allowed for poll workers and voters alike to be at polling sites without masks. A federal appeals court last week effectively kept the order in place through Election Day. The county Republican Party chairman, Rodney Anderson, said in an interview that Ms. Biesel had been the only one of the roughly 300 Republican election judges in the county to refuse to wear a mask; he said he had urged her personally to do so. Throughout the day, however, she remained maskless. “It’s just so dehumanizing,” Ms. Biesel said. “I just like faces. I like people, OK?” she said. — J. David Goodman New York Times photographers are finding voters and poll workers across the country teeming with excitement and a sense of purpose. Daniel “Bud” Brooks, 90, working at polling site in Freedom, N.H., said he had been registering new voters for 56 years. And Daniel Billingslea, 27, encountered outside a polling place where he was canvassing with his mother in Detroit, said “I’m hoping that America will continue to progress while still keeping the things that make America great.” — Marisa Schwartz Taylor ATLANTA — Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia got to vote on Tuesday after all. Mr. Kemp, a Republican who entered quarantine on Friday after his office said he had been exposed to someone who tested positive for the coronavirus, slipped his ballot into a drop box east of Atlanta on Tuesday, ending speculation, much of it online, over whether he would receive his last-minute ballot in time to cast a vote. Mr. Kemp, who only applied for his absentee ballot on Friday, told WSB Radio that the envelope from elections officials had arrived on Monday. In a video on Twitter on Tuesday, a masked Mr. Kemp approached the drop box, turned in his ballot and flashed a thumbs-up sign. Go vote! #Election2020 pic.twitter.com/bVuTn8jimo The question over whether Mr. Kemp’s ballot would reach him before the polls closed on Tuesday was the only suspense related to his vote: He has been a vocal backer of President Trump for years, and Mr. Trump’s reciprocal support helped Mr. Kemp win the Republican primary for governor in 2018. On the day of the general election that year, Mr. Kemp, who then oversaw Georgia elections as secretary of state, voted in person in Winterville, Ga., where the poll-issued card he inserted into the machine was rejected as invalid. He successfully voted a few minutes later. — Alan Blinder GLOBAL ROUNDUP Britain will conduct its first coronavirus testing on a citywide scale in Liverpool, a city of half a million people in northern England that has been among the country’s worst-hit areas. Everyone working or living in the city will be offered tests, even if they are asymptomatic, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday, days after announcing a monthlong nationwide lockdown set to begin this week. The testing in Liverpool — in workplaces, schools and universities, and hospitals and nursing homes — will begin on Friday, a day after nonessential business and pubs and restaurants across the country will be forced to close. Liverpool has reported over 410 weekly cases per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the highest numbers in the country. “These tests will help identify the many thousands of people in the city who don’t have symptoms but can still infect others without knowing,” Mr. Johnson said in a statement. He added that millions of additional tests could be distributed elsewhere in Britain if the results are conclusive in Liverpool. Britain has struggled to contain the spread of a virus that has claimed the lives of over 55,000, the highest toll in Europe. For months, Mr. Johnson has vowed to increase testing capacities and reach the threshold of 10 million people tested every day, but what he once described as a “world beating” test-and-trace program has remained riddled with delays, technical glitches and poorly trained contact tracers. In other developments around the world: Spain’s northern region of Castile and León on Tuesday ordered all bars and restaurants to close, and joined the growing chorus of regions urging the central government in Madrid to tighten the country’s lockdown rules. On Monday, the leader of Asturias, another northern region, asked the central government to order a 15-day full lockdown, but the idea was rejected by Salvador Illa, Spain’s health minister, who said that the central government had no plan to force people to stay indoors again, as it did in the spring. Hong Kong will require all travelers arriving from anywhere outside mainland China to quarantine for 14 days at a hotel starting Nov. 13, and to present confirmation of a hotel room reservation in the city for the entire period, the government said Tuesday. “In view of the severe global pandemic situation, Hong Kong cannot afford to drop its guard on entry prevention and control measures,” a government spokesman said. The Chinese territory reported nine new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, including two linked to a cluster from a “staycation” on a picturesque island. Denmark’s parliament said on Tuesday that it had suspended voting after five lawmakers reported that they had positive for the virus, Reuters reported. At least four more lawmakers and six ministers had isolated themselves and were awaiting test results. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said that she had met with one of the ministers on Friday and, as a result, had postponed a question-and-answer session that she had been scheduled to hold in parliament on Tuesday. — Elian Peltier, Raphael Minder and Elaine Yu   What has the pandemic meant for the Begay family of Kayenta, Ariz.? Job loss, curfews, a break-in and dreams deferred. Acadianna Begay, 19, lives with her extended family in the Navajo Nation. Her father Ray, 58, a carpenter and tour guide in Monument Valley, saw his work dry up completely. Acadianna: My boyfriend and I were looking earlier this year at moving to Phoenix. I had heard that Amazon was hiring for packaging jobs there paying $18 an hour. Personally, I never lived off the reservation, so this was kind of a dream. … The whole plan was for him to go there, get the apartment, get everything settled, then maybe we start a family. Then the coronavirus hit. Life just seems upside down now. My boyfriend is 26 and served in the Marines. He had a casino job in Farmington that let him go, so he was on unemployment. Now he’s just jumping around, dealing with the Navajo Nation curfew against the coronavirus. When the pandemic hit, he would visit me every now and then. Unfortunately, he ended up being caught after leaving one night, and they locked him up in jail until 10 a.m. the next day. Now he jokes around, “If we ever have kids, I’m going to tell them I snuck out and broke curfew just to see you.” Ray: In a normal year, I’d be guiding all around Monument Valley from dawn to late at night. After my work disappeared, I’ve been focusing on the basics. Working on cornfields, hauling water every day. Keeping the jackrabbits away from the corn. I’ve been tending the sheep at my mom’s, so I head out there every day. My parents need all the help I can provide. When they both went to the grocery store in town, someone broke into their place. They stole baskets from them. That’s how crazy this time is, people stealing from other people who hardly have anything. — Simon Romero “Hello, this is just a test call,” a female robocall voice intones. “Time to stay home. Stay safe and stay home.” The calls began back in June, according to YouMail, a service that offers robocall blocking for smartphones. But they have increased greatly as the election has approached, grabbing the attention of some election officials in recent days. YouMail found evidence that the robocalls have reached 280 of the country’s 317 area codes since this summer, peaking at more than 600,000 calls in one day. Over all, the company has tracked 10 million similar calls in October. Though the calls do not mention the election explicitly, their timing and lack of information were suspicious, said Alex Quilci, YouMail’s chief executive. Robocalls in favor of a political candidate typically include some “get out the vote” information or a call for donations, he said. These did not. “It’s worthy of investigation to try to figure out what’s going on here,” Mr. Quilci said. “To do something at this scale is a bit of work.” Mr. Quilci added: “What scares me is that this shows that someone" — a foreign or domestic bad actor — “could cause havoc with robocalls.” The Washington Post earlier reported news of the robocall campaign. Election experts focused on disinformation tend to focus on the spread of false information on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. But misinformation can reach voters through a variety of mediums, including text messages and robocalling. Such methods can help misinformation stay under the radar, allowing it to spread widely before it is noticed. On Tuesday morning, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel warned constituents that “multiple robocalls” had gone out to Flint, Mich., residents directing them to vote on Wednesday. “Obviously this is FALSE and an effort to suppress the vote,” Ms. Nessel said in a tweet. “No long lines and today is the last day to vote.” Getting reports of multiple robocalls going to Flint residents that, due to long lines, they should vote tomorrow.
Obviously this is FALSE and an effort to suppress the vote. No long lines and today is the last day to vote. Don’t believe the lies! Have your voice heard! RT PLS. The New York state attorney general, Letitia James, announced on Tuesday that she was investigating the robocalls. “Attempts to hinder voters from exercising their right to cast their ballots are disheartening, disturbing, and wrong,” Ms. James said in a statement. “What’s more is that it is illegal, and it will not be tolerated.” — Davey Alba Peru’s government reopened Machu Picchu this week after seven months of closure because of the pandemic. The Incan citadel is the country’s biggest tourist attraction, nestled in the mountains near Cusco, and its shuttering has hampered the local economy. The Peruvian government said it would reopen the ruins at 30 percent capacity with biosecurity protocols, dropping admissions from thousands of people daily to 675. Pol Arahuallpa, 28, has been a guide at the UNESCO World Heritage Site for five years. He said lockdown sent him and colleagues reeling, and that minimal government aid left them without income. “In Cusco, a big part of the population lives directly or indirectly off of tourism,” he said. “So at the beginning of the pandemic, many of us had to go find different kinds of work.” “We had no other option than to invent another kind of income,” he added. “I have a lot of colleagues who have to work as security guards, sell things in the streets.” Peru has recorded more than 900,000 cases of the coronavirus and nearly 35,000 deaths, though daily reported cases have significantly dropped from spikes this summer. Peru’s culture minister, Alejandro Neyra, said in a statement that the reopening was a sign that “our culture is still alive among Peruvians.” In 2018, the ruins drew more than 1.5 million visitors from around the world. But Mr. Arahuallpa said that because of decreased international travel, he  does not think the reopening will make a significant economic dent for workers like himself. “The most convenient thing would be to have international visitors,” he said, “but with the pandemic, we’re still not prepared for that.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
