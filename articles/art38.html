A wild day of sparring, as the Trump and Biden campaigns battle over the next debates. Trump unleashes a barrage of attacks in interview, pulling focus from V.P. debate. The F.B.I. discloses a plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. Pelosi rules out aid covering only airlines as Trump claims stimulus talks are back on. The virus took center stage in the skirmish between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris. ‘We’re not a democracy,’ says Mike Lee, a Republican senator. That’s a good thing, he adds. ‘Big Oil knew’: Environmental group’s ad targets energy companies, and Trump. They’re voting as if it’s their last chance, which it might well be. Remote, or in-person? One more debate, or two? The Trump campaign, the Biden campaign and the Commission on Presidential Debates engaged in a head-snapping round of sparring on Thursday over when and how the next face-offs should be held, and how they could take place safely amid the health concerns raised since President Trump contracted the coronavirus. The morning began with the commission announcing that the next debate, scheduled for Oct. 15 in Miami, would be held remotely “in order to protect the health and safety of all involved.” The Biden camp was open to the idea, but President Trump rejected it as “ridiculous.” That prompted Joseph R. Biden Jr’s campaign to call for the debate to be pushed back a week, to Oct. 22, “so that the president is not able to evade accountability.” “Joe Biden was prepared to accept the C.P.D.’s proposal for a virtual Town Hall, but the president has refused, as Donald Trump clearly does not want to face questions from the voters about his failures on Covid and the economy,” Mr. Biden’s deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said in a statement. The Trump campaign seemed open to that. Bill Stepien, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, issued a statement agreeing to pushing the debate back a week — and suggesting without evidence that the commission was trying to help Mr. Biden. “We agree that this should happen on Oct. 22, and accordingly, the third debate should then be shifted back one week to Oct. 29,” Mr. Stepien said. Not so fast, the Biden campaign said. Ms. Bedingfield issued a new statement, suggesting that the Oct. 22 debate should be the last and final one of the campaign. “Donald Trump doesn’t make the debate schedule; the Debate Commission does,” Ms. Bedingfield said in a statement. “We accepted the three dates — Sept. 29, Oct. 15, and Oct. 22 — in June. Trump chose today to pull out of the Oct. 15th debate. Trump’s erratic behavior does not allow him to rewrite the calendar, and pick new dates of his choosing. “We look forward to participating in the final debate, scheduled for Oct. 22, which already is tied for the latest debate date in 40 years,” she said. “Donald Trump can show up, or he can decline again. That’s his choice.” It was another sign of how the coronavirus, which sent Mr. Trump to the hospital and has spread through the White House and official Washington, has upended the last month of the campaign. The debate commission has the power to set rules and safety protocols, and Mr. Trump’s diagnosis and the spreading outbreak complicated its task considerably. Mr. Trump had immediately objected to the concept of a virtual debate in an interview with Fox Business, saying: “I’m not going to waste my time on a virtual debate, that’s not what debating is all about. You sit behind a computer and do a debate — it’s ridiculous.” The campaign has sought to shift attention away from the administration’s response to the pandemic in the debates, and a virtual debate would by its very structure call attention to the degree to which the virus has upended the country. But Mr. Trump’s resistance put his campaign in a difficult position: Mr. Trump’s first debate outing, last week in Cleveland, got poor reviews, as he repeatedly interrupted and heckled Mr. Biden and the moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News. The campaign was anxious for a second chance. Mr. Biden, speaking briefly to reporters before boarding a plane to Arizona on Thursday, suggested that he would be open to following the commission’s recommendations for a virtual debate, and said that Mr. Trump had once again shown himself to be impulsive and unpredictable. “We don’t know what the president is going to do,” Mr. Biden said. “He changes his mind every second.” — Michael M. Grynbaum, Neil Vigdor and Michael Cooper President Trump attacked two cabinet members who are closest to him, insisted he wouldn’t take part in a virtual debate against his Democratic challenger and revisited the events of the 2016 campaign in a meandering, hourlong telephone interview on Fox Business Channel on Thursday. Mr. Trump called the Democratic vice-presidential nominee a “monster” and the F.B.I. director “disappointing,” posited that he might have contracted the coronavirus from a member of a military family, maintained that he is almost off medical treatments for the virus and complained about not being allowed to hold rallies while he remains in isolation. “I don’t think I’m contagious at all,” Mr. Trump said, although his positive diagnosis was revealed last Friday and people with the virus are typically contagious for at least a week and often longer. Of his treatments, he insisted, “I think I’m taking almost nothing.” His doctor has not said how long he will remain on steroids. Mr. Trump’s interview effectively wiped out attention being paid to the vice-presidential debate the night before, which Trump allies felt had gone well for Vice President Mike Pence. The president’s circuitous conversation with the host Maria Bartiromo came as he has been eager to dispel questions about his health after spending four days at Walter Reed, following a drop in his oxygen levels and a fever, chills and a cough related to the virus. But Mr. Trump’s standing in the race against Joseph R. Biden Jr., whom he trails in polls, was clearly frustrating to him. Mr. Trump criticized both Attorney General Bill Barr and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, two cabinet members often described as among his closest aides. Mr. Trump said of investigations into the origins of the probe of his 2016 campaign and whether it conspired with Russian officials, “Bill Barr is going to go down either as the greatest attorney general in the history of the country or he’s going to go down as a very sad, sad situation. I mean, I’ll be honest with you. He’s got all the information he needs.” At another point, Mr. Trump took aim at Mr. Pompeo for not releasing documents related to Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state under President Obama. “They’re in the State Department, but Mike Pompeo has been unable to get them out, which is very sad, actually. I’m not happy about him for that reason,” Mr. Trump said. The president has been tweeting this week about documents that purportedly show that Mrs. Clinton planned to gin up a scandal tying Mr. Trump to Russia. Democrats say the documents that the administration released are misleading. “These people should be indicted — this was the greatest political crime in the history of our country,” Mr. Trump said. “And that includes Obama, and it includes Biden.” Mr. Trump also criticized the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, for not backing up Mr. Trump’s view, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that voting by mail is rife with fraud, and he declined to commit to keeping Mr. Wray in a second term. And he referred to Senator Kamala Harris, Mr. Biden’s running mate, as a “monster” twice and a “communist” four times. He tried to downplay the seriousness of the medication he’d been taking, as well as the virus itself. After calling an experimental antibody cocktail that is still being studied a “cure,” Mr. Trump claimed he didn’t need to take medicine. “It’s not a heavy steroid,” Mr. Trump said of the heavy steroid he’s been taking, dexamethasone. And he theorized that he could have caught the virus from a relative of a fallen service member at a ceremony he hosted for Gold Star families. Mr. Trump said those relatives insisted on hugging him or thanking him. “I can’t back up, Maria, and say, ‘Give me room, I want room, give me 12 feet, stay 12 feet away.’ They come within an inch of my face sometimes,” he said. “They want to hug me and they want to kiss me. And they do. And frankly, I’m not telling them to back up.” — Maggie Haberman Six men were arrested and accused of plotting with a militia group to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, the authorities announced on Thursday. The men, who the F.B.I. said espoused anti-government views, had talked about taking Ms. Whitmer, a Democrat, hostage since at least the summer, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court and unsealed on Thursday. They had surveilled Ms. Whitmer’s vacation home in August and September and indicated that they wanted to take her hostage before the presidential election in November, Richard J. Trask II, an F.B.I. special agent, said in the criminal complaint. He said the F.B.I. believed the men were planning to buy explosives this week for their attempt. Several of the men had talked about creating a society in which they could be “self-sufficient” and one said he wanted 200 men to storm the Statehouse in Lansing, Mich, the complaint said. Over the summer, the men gathered for firearms training and combat drills and tried to make explosives; in July, one of the men said the group should take Ms. Whitmer hostage and move her to a “secure location” in Wisconsin for a “trial,” the agent said. The F.B.I. said it had learned so much about the group by intercepting encrypted messages and because it had undercover agents and confidential informants working with the group. The six men — five of whom live in Michigan and one of whom lives in Delaware — were charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping, which can carry a life sentence. More details were expected at a news conference later on Thursday with the state’s attorney general. Ms. Whitmer has been the subject of right-wing protests for measures she imposed to control the spread of the coronavirus. In April, President Trump had openly encouraged protests against social distancing restrictions in Michigan and several other states with stay-at-home orders, just a day after his administration announced a set of guidelines for how the nation’s governors should carry out an orderly reopening of their communities on their own timetables. In a series of all-caps tweets that started just after a Fox News report on the protests, the president declared, “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” and “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” He also lashed out at Virginia, where the state’s Democratic governor and legislature have pushed for strict gun control measures, saying: “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!”  — Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Shaila Dewan Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said on Thursday that he had been avoiding the White House since midsummer over concerns that officials there were not taking proper precautions against the coronavirus. “My impression was that their approach to how to handle this was different from mine and what I insisted that we do in the Senate, which is to wear a mask and practice social distancing,” Mr. McConnell told reporters in Hebron, Ky. He said he had not visited the White House since Aug. 6, when he met with President Trump to discuss negotiations over additional stimulus legislation. The decision appears to have been a prudent one now that the White House has become a virus hot spot, with Mr. Trump the most prominent to contract the disease. More than a dozen White House guests and employees, including two of Mr. McConnell’s fellow Senate Republicans, were infected after attending an event Mr. Trump held last month to announce his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Mr. McConnell, who is leading the drive to confirm Judge Barrett, had been noticeably absent from the largely maskless gathering. Mr. McConnell did not specifically comment on Judge Barrett’s nomination ceremony. Though he has closely aligned himself with Mr. Trump politically, Mr. McConnell, who is 78 and suffered from polio as a child, has consistently struck a different, more sobering tone when discussing the virus. He has publicly urged Americans to wear masks, repeatedly warned that the pandemic’s grip will be long and stated that he believes a vaccine will not be widely available until next year. “This is not over,” Mr. McConnell said. “We are going to have to work through it.” — Nicholas Fandos Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California on Thursday said she would not agree to stand-alone aid package for airlines unless the Trump administration committed to a broader pandemic relief plan to help struggling Americans, declaring that “there is no stand-alone bill without a bigger bill.” Her comments cast doubt on the prospects for a compromise just hours after President Trump had given an upbeat assessment, saying in an interview that he had reconsidered his decision to pull the plug on bipartisan negotiations on a stimulus plan until after the election. “I shut down talks two days ago because they weren’t working out,” Mr. Trump told Fox Business. “Now they’re starting to work out.” The prospect of a deal remained remote, given the steep political obstacles that have hampered agreement for months. Still, Ms. Pelosi and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, have continued to talk privately about a potential aid measure for airlines to prevent tens of thousands of workers from being furloughed or laid off, and were scheduled to do so again later Thursday. Mr. Trump said the discussions had also touched on the possibility of another round of $1,200 stimulus checks. “We’re talking about airlines and we’re talking about a bigger deal than airlines,” he said. Ms. Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill that she had made it clear to Mr. Mnuchin on Wednesday evening that her willingness to consider an airline rescue measure was contingent on the administration’s agreement to a broader stimulus plan. “We’re happy to review what that stand-alone bill would look like, as part of a bigger bill, if there’s a bigger bill,” she said. “We’re at the table — we want to continue the conversation.” Republicans blocked a Democratic proposal for airline aid on Friday, calling it partisan and too expensive. A similar Republican bill in the Senate would repurpose unspent funds from the $2.2 trillion stimulus law enacted last spring, a move that many Democrats have opposed. Still, Mr. Trump appeared to be hoping anew for some kind of deal before Election Day, after his move to publicly scuttle the stimulus discussions prompted alarm among Republicans that voters would blame them for the collapse of the effort. — Emily Cochrane As Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris clashed over the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic Wednesday night, Mr. Pence defended the White House’s record without addressing its fundamental failures, while Ms. Harris accused him and President Trump of presiding over a public-health catastrophe. Ms. Harris delivered a comprehensive denunciation of the Trump administration’s policies, ranging from the economy and climate change to health care regulation and taxes. As Ms. Harris attacked Mr. Trump, the vice president sought to recast Mr. Trump’s record on the pandemic and other issues in conventional and inoffensive terms, though often in plain defiance of the facts. The vice president made misleading or plainly false claims about White House policies on a range of subjects weighing down Mr. Trump in the presidential race. Mr. Pence claimed that the president had a plan to protect people with pre-existing medical conditions, even though he does not; hailed the “V-shaped recovery” of the economy despite  the latest government data; and repeatedly claimed that Mr. Trump would always “follow the science” on climate change even though he has spent his term denying the scientific consensus on global warming and dismantling environmental regulations. After Mr. Trump’s belligerent performance against Mr. Biden last week, the Harris-Pence forum in Salt Lake City mostly stood out for how different it was from that debate. It was for the most part a gloves-on affair, more akin to conventional political debates of yesteryear, albeit one playing out in a moment of national crisis. — Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, accused Democrats Wednesday of pursuing a vision of “rank democracy” at odds with safeguarding personal “liberty” — articulating a philosophy Democrats see as underpinning a conservative push to restrict voting rights and environmental regulations. Mr. Lee, the son of Ronald Reagan’s solicitor general Rex E. Lee and a former clerk to the conservative Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, began a long series of Twitter pronouncements a half-hour into Wednesday’s vice-presidential debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris in his home state’s capital, Salt Lake City. “We’re not a democracy,” wrote Mr. Lee, 49, who is in isolation after testing positive for the coronavirus last week. “The word ‘democracy’ appears nowhere in the Constitution, perhaps because our form of government is not a democracy. It’s a constitutional republic. To me it matters. It should matter to anyone who worries about the excessive accumulation of power in the hands of the few.” His last tweet, posted just after midnight local time, concluded, apparently without spell-checking: “Democracy isn’t the objective; liberty, peace, and prospefity are. We want the human condition to flourish. Rank democracy can thwart that.” Mr. Lee’s statements elicited criticism from progressives who saw them as an attempt to rationalize Republican attempts to suppress the vote. The New York University historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat called his comments an “escalation of GOP and WH rhetoric about protestors being a mob and Dems being ‘too dangerous to rule,’” adding, “Such talk often precedes ‘exceptional’ and authoritarian gov’t actions. Look for more of this in future.” It was not clear what prompted the declarations, although Mr. Lee has been a critic of executive-branch overreach, environmental regulations and Democratic efforts to expand mail-in balloting. In 2016, he questioned whether Mr. Trump, whom he now supports, had “authoritarian" tendencies. To some extent, Mr. Lee was saying out loud what many conservatives have been saying quietly for years: that redistribution of wealth through taxation or attempts to regulate business are a threat to liberty, even if they are widely popular. “Government is the official use of coercive force — nothing more and nothing less. The Constitution protects us by limiting the use of government force,” he wrote late Wednesday. Not all of his tweets were about democracy and freedom, however. “We consume more Jello on a per capita basis than any state in the Union,” he wrote of Utah as the debate got underway. — Glenn Thrush AD WATCH Amid the chaotic news cycle of the election, there has been some groundbreaking reporting from Bloomberg News about what Exxon and other oil companies knew about climate change, and how they spent billions to bury the information. Now the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group, is taking the issue to the presidential stage, to Big Oil, and to President Trump. It’s a familiar, and potent, attack often levied against corporations that profit while damaging public health: Wealthy executives are never made to feel the true repercussions of their actions. The ad features actors playing oil moguls lounging in mansions and acknowledging that they know that “the world is on fire” but that “this climate thing is your problem.” One faux executive explains how oil companies “invested in political campaigns” as the screen shows President Trump calling human-caused climate change “a hoax.” He lauds the president for “rolling back all those fossil fuel regulations.” The ad ends with a nod to future generations, as one executive turns to the camera says, “You got a lot of work to do, because your kids are going to need it,” then toasts Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump did indeed call global warming a hoax on the campaign trail in 2015. And his administration has rolled back more than five dozen environmental regulations, according to a tally kept by The Times. In 2015, Inside Climate News reported that Exxon’s own internal research and data showed that the company was aware of the impact of fossil fuels on global warming for decades, and that it played down studies on climate change by sowing uncertainty. This week, Bloomberg News reported that “Exxon Mobil Corp. had plans to increase annual carbon-dioxide emissions by as much as the output of the entire nation of Greece,” with an internal assessment of its investment strategy showing “yearly emissions rising 17 percent by 2025.” (The company said in a statement to Bloomberg that the assessment was preliminary and that its projections had since changed.) A $2 million campaign on national cable, as well as digitally in Arizona, a swing state that Mr. Trump won in 2016 but where Joseph R. Biden is now leading in polls. Climate change is among the most important issues to young voters, and the threat to the global climate, with the daily reminders of vast wildfires and powerful hurricanes, is a galvanizing force this election cycle. Directing that energy in the electorate at villainous wealthy executives and tying them to Mr. Trump directly injects the president into a situation most voters recoil at: the wealthy taking advantage of the rest. — Nick Corasaniti Maya D. Wiley, a former top lawyer for Mayor Bill de Blasio who has gained a national following as a political and legal analyst for MSNBC, announced Wednesday night that she was running for mayor of New York City and immediately sought to distance herself from her former boss. In a campaign launch video, Ms. Wiley pointedly did not mention Mr. de Blasio by name, but invoked his tenure as she pointed to a “crisis of confidence in our city’s leadership.” Mr. de Blasio must leave office next year because of term limits. “Some will say I don’t sound like past mayors or look like them or think like them, and I say yes, I don’t — that is the point,” said Ms. Wiley, who is Black. “I am not a conventional candidate. But changing it up isn’t the risk. Electing the same kinds of people, bringing the same old broken promises over and over again and expecting things will be different — that’s the risk we can’t afford right now.” Her announcement had been expected for months after Ms. Wiley left her role at MSNBC in July to explore a run. The mayor’s race next year has been reshaped by the pandemic and by massive Black Lives Matter protests in the city. By urging voters to support her “if you’re tired of the same old thing,” Ms. Wiley cast herself as an outsider, despite her affiliation with the de Blasio administration, a strategy that would distinguish her from two leading Democratic candidates — Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, and Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller — who are longtime public servants. Maya Wiley is also a former head of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent agency that investigates complaints from the public about police misconduct. She plans to formally begin her campaign today at an event outside the Brooklyn Museum with her family and supporters, including Michael Gianaris, a powerful Democratic state senator from Queens known most for his successful efforts to disrupt Amazon’s deal for a headquarters in his borough.  — Emma G.

Annamarie Eggert has voted in every presidential election since 1948, when she cast her ballot for Harry S. Truman. Now she is 94 and ailing, but determined to vote in this one, too. Mrs. Eggert, a Biden supporter from Maine, has expressive aphasia, a condition that has made it difficult for her to talk. “We — need — to get Trump out of there,” she said, each word painstakingly coaxed from her lips. “Come hell — or high water, I will — vote.” In this most contentious of elections, in which the very act of voting has come under fierce national debate, the determination of many very old, ill and infirm Americans to cast what could be their last vote is profound. Though aware that they might not live long enough to be affected by the results, they say they are voting for children, grandchildren and their future — a final act as Americans. “Most of my life at this point really is vicarious,” said Jill Haak Adels, 82, who has an aggressive form of cancer and a progressive lung condition that makes her increasingly short of breath. Yet she is making sure she will be able to vote, and intends to cast a straight Republican ballot. “The president we have now is just fine,” she said. “He’s done a lot of things that have been overdue for a long time.” Dr. Barry K. Baines, a physician who wrote a book on “ethical wills” — documents in which people pass along their values — noted that those in their late 80s and 90s belonged to the Greatest Generation, who grew up during World War II. “At its core, this was the most civic-minded generation,” he said. “If you’re an American, you vote because you have the freedom to vote. So that generation has a sense of how effective one person’s vote can be.” — Katie Hafner Vice President Mike Pence approached his task on Wednesday as he has approached his four years as the executive straight man to an unruly leader: not merely defending President Trump but effectively insisting, with poker-faced conviction, that those who doubt his boss should not believe their eyes and ears. The trouble this time was not Mr. Pence’s skill on this front, which remains peerless. It was the facts underpinning this debate, which remains inconvenient to an administration so overwhelmed by the virus that its own West Wing has become a hot spot. And so Mr. Pence — stripped of most politically palatable explanations for the White House pandemic response — set off on a curious charge when Senator Kamala Harris said that the Trump team’s leadership “clearly” had not worked: He chose to hear it as a direct affront to the American people. “When you say what the American people have done over these last eight months hasn’t worked,” Mr. Pence said gravely, as controlled as his president is rambunctious onstage, “that’s a great disservice to the sacrifices the American people have made.” At last, the strain seemed to be showing, at least a little. Perhaps that is what a full term of wear-and-tear can do to even the most accomplished rhetorical gymnast. Or perhaps the reality is simply too bleak for any administration to explain away entirely: The president has contracted the virus that has killed more than 210,000 people in the United States on his watch. His behavior, since leaving the hospital on Monday, appears to be a continuation of the kind of scientifically dubious happy talk that has left the Trump-Pence ticket at a significant polling disadvantage four weeks before Election Day. — Matt Flegenheimer and Annie Karni TRANSCRIPT “President Trump has several times refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If Vice President Biden is declared the winner and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what would be your role and responsibility as vice president? What would you personally do? You have two minutes.” “Well, Susan, first and foremost, I think we’re going to win this election, because while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany of the establishment in Washington, D.C., an establishment that Joe Biden’s been a part of for 47 years, President Donald Trump has launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. When you talk about accepting the outcome of the election. I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election. It’s amazing. We’ve all seen the avalanche — what what you put the country through for the better part of three years until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion, case closed. And then, Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the president of the United States over a phone call. And now Hillary Clinton has actually said to Joe Biden that under — in her words, under no circumstances should he concede the election. So let me just say, I think we’re going to win this election.” Vice President Mike Pence was asked during Wednesday night’s debate, in a question similar to one put before President Trump at last week’s presidential matchup, what he would do if Mr. Trump refused to accept the election results should he lose to Joseph R. Biden Jr. Just as Mr. Trump has done repeatedly, Mr. Pence declined to say what he would do — nor did he offer any commitment to accepting a negative result. “First and foremost, I think we’re going to win this election,” Mr. Pence said before turning his attention to his debate opponent, Senator Kamala Harris. “When you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election. It’s amazing.” Mr. Pence never got around to saying what he would do if Mr. Trump declined to accept a losing result. Senator Kamala Harris was asked a similar question about what she and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would do if Mr. Trump refused to step aside. She offered few specifics, but instead made a plea for supporters to vote as soon as possible. “I’d like to say to everybody, vote,” she said. “Please vote. Vote early, come up with a plan to vote.” She added: “We have it within our power in these next 27 days to make the decision about what will be the course of our country for the next four years. And it is within our power and if we use our vote and our voice, we will win.” — Reid J. Epstein It was the first time a woman of color had ever appeared on a presidential or vice-presidential general election debate stage, and the tightrope Senator Kamala Harris had to walk was never far from sight. Just consider the reaction in the Republican pollster Frank Luntz’s focus group of undecided voters: “She is applauded for her knowledge,” Mr. Luntz wrote on Twitter, “but they just don’t like her ‘condescending reactions.’” That some voters would view Ms. Harris’s reactions as condescending, and recoil at them — the laughs, head shakes and “are you kidding me” expressions she displayed at various points in response to Vice President Mike Pence — was not surprising. Nor was the lack of comparable backlash to Mr. Pence’s head shakes and unamused expressions. Research shows that voters see certain behavior as assertive or authoritative when it comes from men but aggressive or condescending when it comes from women. The double standard is more severe for women of color, and the specific criticism lodged against Ms. Harris has both racial and gendered components. “Her facial expressions and the eye rolls and neck movements were quintessential Black woman — she was signaling, ‘Don’t start,’” said Nadia E. Brown, an associate professor of political science and African-American studies at Purdue University. “However, what came out of her mouth was what people tuned in to the debate to hear,” Dr. Brown said. “She gave clear policy contrasts, and that’s really what the debate should be about.” Dr. Brown and other experts who study women of color in politics said that while double standards were very much present, Ms. Harris may also have helped herself and the Democratic ticket by calmly asserting herself when interrupted. “I’m speaking,” she said less than 15 minutes in, a line she would repeat more than once: “I’m speaking.” “Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking.” Women of all political persuasions can relate to being spoken over and dismissed, Dr. Brown said, and that does not necessarily help the Trump campaign win over, say, white suburban women — who helped lift Mr. Trump to victory in 2016, but among whom he is badly trailing in the polls. “With the tightrope she’s walking, she’s definitely not going to make everybody happy,” said Amanda Hunter, research and communications director at the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, which supports women in politics. But, she added, “it’s so important that a woman candidate stand up for herself in a debate, and that can display strength to voters.” The Biden campaign, for its part, sought to use the gendered dynamics to its advantage in the post-debate spin. “He didn’t just mansplain,” Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to the Biden campaign, said of Mr. Pence. “He man-dodged.” — Maggie Astor About an hour into Wednesday night’s presidential debate, a fly suddenly appeared on Vice President Mike Pence’s head, resting motionless yet extremely visible set against his silver hair. It sat there for two minutes and three seconds, enough time to spawn thousands of memes and somehow crash Twitter’s trending topics. I sent the fly.
