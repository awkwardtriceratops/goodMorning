Live Updates: Tammy Duckworth Calls Trump a ‘Coward in Chief’<br></h1><p id="artcont">Cory Booker says Biden will fight for unions and the middle class. Alex Padilla and Jocelyn Benson, Democratic secretaries of state, urge everyone to vote quickly. Deb Haaland, a Native-American congresswoman, says ‘voting is sacred and my people know that.’ The D.N.C. pays tribute to John Lewis, a civil rights icon. Keisha Lance Bottoms warns, ‘If we fail to exercise our right to vote, we can lose it.’ Chris Coons, a Delaware ally, recalls Biden’s ‘compassion’ during his father’s illness. Julia Louis-Dreyfus says Biden was a fan of her Amtrak magazine cover. Andrew Yang, now a bona fide political star, reminds Democrats that he was right. In searing terms, Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois vouched for Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s ability to be commander in chief, endorsing him in a way that she, a military veteran whose legs were amputated after her helicopter was shot down in Iraq, is uniquely positioned to do. Service members deserve a leader “who understands the risks they face and who would actually protect them by doing his job as commander in chief,” Ms. Duckworth said, in a speech that followed a video about Mr. Biden’s connections to the military. “Instead, they have a coward in chief who won’t stand up to Vladimir Putin, read his daily intelligence briefings or even publicly admonish adversaries for reportedly putting bounties on our troops’ heads.” She spoke in emotional detail not only about her own struggles after her injury, but the stress it placed on her husband. “When his son Beau deployed to Iraq, his burden was also shouldered by his family,” Ms. Duckworth said. “Joe knows the fear military families live with because he’s felt that dread of never knowing if your deployed loved one is safe. He understands their bravery because he has had to muster that same strength every hour of every day Beau was overseas.” Ms. Duckworth’s military background and compelling personal story led Mr. Biden to seriously consider her as his running mate, though he ultimately concluded that choosing her would invite legal battles because she was born abroad to a father who was an American citizen and a mother who was not. — Maggie Astor Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, had expected a big week as a host of Milwaukee’s convention that wasn’t. Ms. Baldwin, who in 2012 became the first openly gay woman to be elected to the Senate, focused on one of the most popular elements of Obamacare in her prime-time speech: the provision that allows those under 26 to remain on their parents’ health plans. “When I was 9 years old, I got sick, really sick. I was hospitalized. But since my grandparents were the ones raising me, and our family’s health plan didn’t cover grandkids, they were forced to pay out of pocket for my three-month hospital stay,” Ms. Baldwin recalled. “I was marked ‘child with a pre-existing condition,’” she added. “You see, there’s another part of my story: the part where I ran for office, the part where I served in Congress, the part where I worked with Joe Biden and Barack Obama to make sure kids and grandkids, if they’re dependents, can stay on their parents’ health insurance until they’re 26.” — Glenn Thrush Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey focused his convention remarks on the middle class, describing Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a champion of unions and working Americans. Mr. Booker, whose own presidential campaign emphasized a message of unity and who was a leader on gun policy in particular, sharply criticized President Trump for describing the economy as “good” when “40 million Americans are at risk of losing their homes, 30 million aren’t getting enough food to eat, and 5.4 million people have lost their health care because of this crisis.” If Mr. Biden is elected, “together, we’ll fight for those who keep us healthy, who keep us safe, who teach our children,” he said. “We’ll stand for those who cook and serve and clean, who plant and harvest, who pack and always deliver — whose hands are thick with calluses like my grandad’s were.” Mr. Booker described his grandfather as an example of the American dream: Raised in the South under Jim Crow, he moved to Detroit and got a union job on an assembly line, which enabled him to climb into the middle class. “That’s the American dream: Together we work, together we rise,” Mr. Booker said. “Like his generation, up out of the Depression, let’s now work together and stand together — and America, together we will rise.” — Maggie Astor By now it’s no secret: Democrats want their supporters to vote as soon as possible. Alex Padilla and Jocelyn Benson, the secretaries of state of California and Michigan, repeated a pitch that Democratic convention viewers have seen from Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and others this week: Please request your absentee ballot now and send it back right away. President Trump, Mr. Padilla said, “has admitted he is trying to sabotage the post office to undermine voting by mail. It’s a direct attack on our elections.” Ms. Benson made sure voters understood their responsibility. “Our job is to make sure that everybody can vote safely, whether in person or by mail,” she said. “Your job is to make sure you vote.” Both Ms. Benson and Mr. Padilla, Democratic officials who oversee elections in their states, have expanded mail voting efforts during the coronavirus pandemic, as Mr. Trump has sowed doubts about the legitimacy of mail voting even as he has voted by mail himself in Florida’s primary contests. Mr. Padilla, who is among the ambitious Californians in the mix to replace Senator Kamala Harris if she becomes vice president, is sending ballots to every registered voter in the state. Ms. Benson sent absentee ballot applications to everyone on the Michigan voter rolls. After a pitch to text the Biden campaign for help registering to vote and requesting an absentee ballot, Ms. Benson again stressed the urgency of voting quickly. “If you are voting from home, request and return your ballot as soon as possible,” she said. Mr. Padilla added: “Request your ballot now and send it in right away.” — Reid J. Epstein Two states elected the first Native American members of Congress in 2018, an important moment for a diverse array of individual communities facing a common set of dire economic, educational and health care challenges. Sharice Davids, a former mixed martial arts fighter and a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, was elected in Kansas, and Deb Haaland, a community organizer and a member of the Laguna Pueblo, was elected in New Mexico. Ms. Haaland addressed the convention Thursday. “I’m a symbol of our resilience,” she said. “As the embodiment of America’s progress as a nation, I know we can’t take our democracy for granted, especially now as people are dying, as our land is abused, as our Constitution is under attack.” Ms. Haaland, the former chairwoman of New Mexico’s Democratic Party, represents a relatively liberal district that includes most of Albuquerque. She has been a vocal critic of the president’s crackdown on immigration and promoted native sovereignty as a professed “35th-generation New Mexican.” — Glenn Thrush When John Lewis died, the country lost one of its last links to the civil rights movement. Mr. Lewis, who for the last 33 years represented Atlanta in Congress, fought until his final days for legislation to protect the right to vote. During the final night of the Democratic National Convention, the party played a nearly five-minute tribute to Mr. Lewis, drawing on his legacy with tributes from figures including Elijah Cummings, himself a civil rights leader and congressman from Baltimore who died last year. “From Day 1, John Lewis was a role model for members of Congress,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. “Because he brought with him a heft, a weightiness of purpose.” The video was followed by a performance of “Glory,” the Academy Award-winning song by John Legend and Common from the film “Selma.” The film focused on the voting rights marches from Selma, Ala., to Montgomery in 1965, including the Bloody Sunday march, during which Mr. Lewis was badly beaten by state troopers on the Edmund Pettus bridge. — Reid J. Epstein Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta invoked John Lewis, an icon of her city and the civil rights movement, at the Democratic convention, urging Americans to “pass on the gift John Lewis sacrificed to give us”: the right to vote. “People often think that they can’t make a difference like our civil rights icons, but every person in the movement mattered,” Ms. Bottoms said. “Those who made the sandwiches, swept the church floors, stuffed the envelopes — they, too, changed America, and so can we.” Echoing a message former President Barack Obama delivered at Mr. Lewis’s funeral, and one that has become an implicit theme of this week’s convention, Ms. Bottoms warned, “If we fail to exercise our right to vote, we can lose it.” Ms. Bottoms, who was a contender to be Mr. Biden’s running mate, gained national prominence for her response to the protests in Atlanta after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, striking a delicate balance between expressing solidarity with the protesters and warning against violence and property destruction. She also made headlines in July, as coronavirus cases were spiking in Georgia, by imposing a local mask mandate and other restrictions over the objections of Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican. Mr. Kemp sued her for, he argued, violating his legal authority to set consistent statewide rules; he dropped the lawsuit this month and said he would issue an executive order instead. Ms. Bottoms herself was one of the most prominent politicians to contract Covid-19. In her speech on Thursday, she condemned officials who she said were using the pandemic “to spread misinformation and interfere with voting, forcing many in 2020 to still risk their lives to exercise their sacred right to vote — a right that has already been paid for with the blood, sweat, tears and lives of so many.” — Maggie Astor WILMINGTON, Del. — Like all other nights of the Democratic National Convention, Thursday, too, was virtual. But in Joe Biden’s hometown, some of the former vice president’s fans were celebrating together anyway — at a safe distance. An outdoor viewing area, drive-in-movie-style, was set up near the venue where Mr. Biden was slated to speak, replete with oversized American flags, a stage and a large screen. Half an hour before the convention kicked off, attendees milled in the parking lot under a sliver of a moon as upbeat music — some of it familiar from Mr. Biden’s campaign events — played. As the convention got under way, and speakers hit their applause lines, attendees blared their horns in approval. — Katie Glueck Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s verbosity, which has gotten him into trouble over the years, is offset by a willingness to listen quietly as people tell him their problems, an empathetic gift the writer Michael Kruse memorably labeled “Joe Biden’s superpower.” Conveying that warmth has been a challenge during a digital, socially distanced convention, but organizers sought to underscore his compassion — in part, to contrast him with President Trump — in the lead-in to Mr. Biden’s big speech on Thursday. Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware who was sworn into office a decade ago by Mr. Biden, offered a testimonial to the nominee’s “respect for the dignity of all people.” “Joe knows the power of prayer, and I’ve seen him in moments of joy and triumph, of loss and despair, turn to God for strength,” Mr. Coons said. “Joe’s comforted me in my toughest moments, as he has so many others,” he added. “I’ll never forget how Joe took the time to offer me words of comfort as my father lay in hospice.” “That compassion, that empathy,” Mr. Coons said, “is part of his character.” — Glenn Thrush Over the first three nights of the Democratic National Convention, three actresses — Eva Longoria, Kerry Washington and Tracee Ellis Ross — guided viewers through a most unusual convention program. On the fourth night, Julia Louis-Dreyfus brought in some levity as well as some pointed jabs at President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. She first met Mr. Biden while she was starring on the show “Veep.” Shortly after that meeting, she recalled, she was asked to be on the cover of a magazine — specifically, the onboard magazine of Amtrak, which Mr. Biden famously rode every day between the Senate and his children in Wilmington, Del. “The day it came out, my phone rang, and it was the vice president telling me he loved the cover and the whole article,” Ms. Louis-Dreyfus said. “Joe Biden not only knows how to read, but also he reads everything.” Later, she took a sharper tone. “Just remember,” she said, “Joe Biden goes to church so regularly that he doesn’t even need tear gas and a bunch of federalized troops to help him get there.” To get information about voting, she said, voters should text 30330, which “would be the president’s golf score if he didn’t cheat.” “OK, look, I’ll admit that was a little nasty, but we all know he’s a cheater, and I’m proud to be a nasty, nasty woman,” she went on. “You know, when Donald Trump spoke at his inauguration about American carnage, I assumed that was something he was against, not a campaign promise.” In an exchange with the former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, Ms. Louis-Dreyfus also mispronounced Vice President Mike Pence’s name, mocking some conservative commentators’ mispronunciations of Kamala Harris’s name: LOUIS-DREYFUS: I cannot wait to see her debate our current vice president, Micah Paints. YANG: It is pronounced Ponce, I believe. LOUIS-DREYFUS: Oh, some kind of weird foreign name. YANG: Not very American sounding. LOUIS-DREYFUS: Yeah. That’s what people are saying. Of the four actresses serving as hosts, Ms. Louis-Dreyfus has the closest relationship with Mr. Biden. The two filmed a spoof video for the White House Correspondents’ Dinner in 2014. When Ms. Louis-Dreyfus disclosed that she had breast cancer, in 2017, Mr. Biden tweeted his support. “We Veeps stick together. Jill and I, and all of the Bidens, are with you, Julia,” he wrote. — Maggie Astor When Andrew Yang began his 2020 presidential campaign back in November 2017, he was less than an afterthought. When major newspapers wrote stories about potential 2020 candidates and left him out, Mr. Yang himself often emailed reporters with a polite reminder that he was, in fact, a Democratic candidate for president of the United States. Nearly three years later Mr. Yang is a household name, a breakout star of the presidential election cycle who built himself an enduring following from supporters who embraced his call for a universal basic income and his dire warnings about the coming loss of blue-collar jobs. His presidential campaign lasted longer and was more successful than those of a handful of the party’s anointed stars — including Senator Kamala Harris, who wound up the Democratic nominee for vice president. So when Mr. Yang was initially left off the initial list of speakers at this week’s convention, he was hurt. Though supportive of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., he encouraged social media efforts to win him a slot. The campaign worked, and there was Mr. Yang as the opening speaker for the final night of Mr. Biden’s virtual convention. “Hello America!” Mr. Yang said in remarks he delivered Thursday from CNN’s New York studio, where he is a paid contributor to the network. “It’s great to have this time with you on the final night of the Democratic National Convention.” Mr. Yang noted that a lot of the dire predictions he had made during his campaign had already come true, citing his slogan: “Make America Think Harder,” which was abbreviated MATH and sold on copious amounts of campaign merchandise. “You might know me as the guy who ran for president talking about MATH and the future,” Mr. Yang said. “Unfortunately for all of us, that future is now. The pandemic has accelerated everything. If you’re like me and my wife, Evelyn, you don’t know if your child’s school is reopening this fall. Seventy-two percent of Americans believe that this is the worst time we have ever experienced. And 42 percent of the jobs that are now lost — millions of jobs — will never return.” Then Mr. Yang did something he often did on the campaign trail but has not been done much by major speakers during the Democrats’ four-day convention: Make a direct appeal to Trump voters to get behind Mr. Biden. “Back in 2016, if you voted for Trump, or didn’t vote at all, I understand. Many of us have gotten tired of our leaders seeming far removed from our everyday lives,” he said. “But we must give this country a chance to recover — and recovery is only possible with a change of leadership and new ideas.” Then Mr. Yang finished with the sort of self-aware joke that won him raves throughout the campaign. “Now I’ll turn it over to a great Democrat with us throughout the evening,” he said. “We have 11 Emmys between the two of us. How is that for math? One of my favorite actresses, Julia Louis-Dreyfus.” — Reid J. Epstein Gov. Gavin Newsom of California initially had a plum speaking slot at the Democratic convention, but then he had to cancel to deal with wildfires ravaging his state. But Mr. Newsom found time to film — on his own iPhone, framed vertically with a tree behind him — a short testimonial to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, an old political ally of Mr. Newsom’s. “I confess this is not where I expected to be speaking here tonight,” he said. “I’m about a mile or so away from one of over 370 wildfires that we’re battling here in the state of California.” Mr. Newsom offered a plea to viewers to address climate change before catastrophes strike elsewhere. “Climate change is real,” he said. “If you are in denial about climate change, come to California.” — Reid J. Epstein As the newly minted leader of the Democratic Party, Joseph R. Biden Jr. plans to ride out of its national convention with a message for the fall campaign centered on compassion, linking his heart-rending biography of setback and recovery to the lives of Americans hoping for their own rebound in a season of hardships. But looming over Mr. Biden’s long-sought presidential nomination on Thursday  is the ever-present shadow of another man who’s poised to dominate the final 10 weeks of the campaign and use his considerable megaphone to drown out Mr. Biden’s pitch: Donald J. Trump. The president, who spent the day attacking Mr. Biden in the swing state of Pennsylvania, has been the greatest unifying force at the Democratic convention, given that loathing him is the one thing that everyone in the fractious party can agree on. Mr. Biden and the Democrats spent the week prosecuting arguments against him on Covid-19, unemployment, health care, child care, climate change, foreign policy and his fundamental fitness for the presidency — attacks that only presaged a fall campaign that, even when it features Mr. Biden, will be aimed entirely at drawing contrasts with the current occupant of the Oval Office, Democrats say. In a sign of both confidence and prudence, Mr. Biden and his new running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, will not leave Delaware to embark on the traditional boat, bus or train tour of swing states as presidential tickets usually do, in part because they want to model safer behavior than Mr. Trump has in response to the coronavirus. — Jonathan Martin and Shane Goldmacher Even with the awkward limitations of a virtual convention, the programming of the last three nights has built steadily and more or less smoothly toward the unveiling of Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a president-in-waiting. It now falls to him to fill the political silhouette his party has gradually sketched. TRANSCRIPT “Hey, everybody, it’s me, Kamala.” “Tonight we are going to hear from so many phenomenal women who are working to help us build that more perfect union.” “Tonight I’m thinking of the girls and boys who see themselves in America’s future because of Kamala Harris — a black woman, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, and our nominee for vice president. This is our country’s story: breaking down barriers and expanding the circle of possibility.” ♫ “I’m in love with my future, and you don’t know ...” ♫ “Donald Trump’s ignorance and incompetence have always been a danger to our country. Covid-19 was Trump’s biggest test. He failed miserably. Today America has the most Covid deaths in the world and an economic collapse.” “My mom worked hard and paid taxes, and the Obama administration told her she could stay. My dad thought you would protect military families. So he voted for you in 2016, Mr. President. He says he won’t vote for you again after what you did to our family.” “The wife of a U.S. Marine veteran was deported to Mexico.” “Instead of protecting us, you tore our world apart.” “My mom is a good person, and she’s not a criminal.” “Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job, because he can’t. And the consequences of that failure are severe: 170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone, while those at the top take in more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before. But more than anything, what I know about Joe, what I know about Kamala, is that they actually care about every American, and that they care deeply about this democracy. They believe that in a democracy, the right to vote is sacred, and we should be making it easier for people to cast their ballots, not harder. They understand that in this democracy, the commander in chief does not use the men and women of our military, who are willing to risk everything to protect our nation, as political props to deploy against peaceful protesters on our own soil. This president and those in power, those who benefit from keeping things the way they are, they are counting on your cynicism. They know they can’t win you over with their policies. So they’re hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote does not matter.” “With only one nomination received and pursuant to our rules, I hereby declare that Kamala Harris is elected as the Democratic candidate for vice president.” “She is the first black woman, first South Asian woman to be named on the Democratic ticket.” “This is a historic pick.” “Someone who looks like us on a presidential ticket, that’s crazy.” “That I am here tonight is a testament to the dedication of generations before me: women and men who believed so fiercely in the promise of equality, liberty and justice for all. This week marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment. And we celebrate the women who fought for that right. Yet so many of the Black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting long after its ratification. But they were undeterred. Without fanfare or recognition, they organized and testified and rallied and marched and fought, not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table. My mother taught me that service to others gives life purpose and meaning. And oh, how I wish she were here tonight, but I know she’s looking down on me from above. I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman, all of five feet tall, who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, Calif. On that day she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now and speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America. Make no mistake: The road ahead is not easy. We may stumble. We may fall short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly and deal with our challenges honestly. We will speak truths, and we will act with the same faith in you that we ask you to place in us. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.” [music and applause] In the 2020 campaign, Mr. Biden has seldom been the most eloquent advocate for his own cause. In the most important moments of his campaign, he has leaned heavily on other, more magnetic and fluid speakers: James E. Clyburn in the days before the South Carolina primary, and Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg before the Super Tuesday contests in March. He will have help again tonight, from allies who will address the audience before him, including Mr. Buttigieg, Andrew Yang and Senator Tammy Duckworth. But if ever there were a moment for Mr. Biden to stand on his own, this is it. President Trump seems to have done his best this week to tee up a major political opportunity for his challenger, making admiring comments about believers in the conspiracy theory QAnon and calling for Americans to shun Goodyear, the Ohio tire company, because of its restrictions on political attire in the workplace. Mr. Biden’s critique of the president appears as salient as ever — he just has to deliver it. Over his near half-century in public life, Mr. Biden has made good speeches, bad speeches, campaign kickoff speeches and concession speeches, speeches without proper attribution to original sources, speeches so impossibly Biden that no one could ever accuse him of lifting anything. “No one ever doubts that I mean what I say,” Mr. Biden, 77, is fond of telling audiences. “The problem is, I sometimes say all that I mean.” For tonight’s speech, he conferred with family, friends, trusted strategists and others he admires, including Jon Meacham, the presidential historian, whose recent book “The Soul of America” has been echoed by Mr. Biden throughout his presidential bid. — Alexander Burns, Katie Glueck and Matt Flegenheimer Stephen Curry, one of the most popular players in the N.B.A., and his wife, the author and chef Ayesha Curry, will endorse Joseph R. Biden Jr. at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night. The celebrity couple will appear in a pretaped video with their daughters, Riley, 8, and Ryan, 5, one of the highest-profile athlete appearances at a political convention for either party. The endorsement was first reported by People Magazine. “We want to ensure that our kids live in a nation that is safe, happy, healthy and fair, and so this election —— ” Mrs. Curry says in a clip. Mr. Curry cuts in to say, “We’re voting for Joe Biden.” Mr. Curry, a two-time Most Valuable Player Award winner, has kept in close touch with former President Barack Obama, under whom Mr. Biden served, since Mr. Obama left the White House in 2017. Mr. Obama and Mr. Curry appeared together last year at an event in Oakland, Calif., celebrating My Brother’s Keeper, the former president’s initiative aimed at closing the education gap for young Black men. The endorsement is not necessarily a surprise, given that Mr. Curry has been a frequent critic of President Trump since he took office. Early on in Mr. Trump’s presidency, Mr. Curry publicly rebuked the chief executive of Under Armour, Kevin Plank, after Mr. Plank said the president was a “a real asset” to the country. Mr. Curry, who has an endorsement deal with Under Armour, said in an interview with The San Jose Mercury News, “I agree with that description, if you remove the ‘et.’” In fact, one of Mr. Trump’s early feuds in his presidency was with Mr. Curry, who had expressed reluctance about visiting the White House after the Golden State Warriors won the N.B.A. championship in 2017. In response, Mr. Trump rescinded the invitation. “Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team,” Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that September. “Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!” LeBron James, another N.B.A. star who has endorsed Mr. Biden, chimed in on Twitter: “U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain’t going! So therefore ain’t no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!” — Sopan Deb Updated Aug. 20, 2020 </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
