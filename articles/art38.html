A new Monmouth poll shows a tightening race in Pennsylvania. The owner of a damaged Kenosha business rejected Trump’s photo op. So the White House used the ex-owner. Biden and Trump trade blows in an ad war on law and order. Biden will give a speech today faulting Trump over reopening schools. As virus cases spike in Iowa, Joni Ernst spreads a debunked theory of inflated death figures. Ed Markey held off Joseph Kennedy in a Democratic Senate clash in Massachusetts. Russians are again targeting Americans with disinformation, Facebook and Twitter warn. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s lead over President Trump among registered voters in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania has shrunk from 13 percentage points to just four points, according to polling released Wednesday by Monmouth University. The narrowing is largely because Mr. Trump has begun consolidating support from Republicans and conservative voters who have disapproved of his stewardship, but it is also is due to declining support for Mr. Biden among men over all and among voters under age 50. Mr. Biden has led 36 of the last 37 public polls of Pennsylvania, a state Mr. Trump carried by 44,000 votes out of 6 million cast in 2016. Mr. Trump’s victory there, powered by a combination of stronger than expected support for him in the state’s rural areas and weak turnout in major cities, prompted a multi-year Democratic reckoning that the Scranton-born Mr. Biden and his allies are still struggling to process. The Monmouth poll also shows that a high turnout model narrowly benefits Mr. Biden. The Democratic nominee leads the race by three points when the poll assumes a high turnout, but by just one point if there is low turnout. Still, the poll found Mr. Biden retains healthy leads among the people most likely to vote. He is leading by 11 points among voters 65 and older, a demographic Mr. Trump carried by 10 points in 2016, according to exit polls. The poll also found Pennsylvania’s self-described independent voters are split evenly between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, with each taking 45 percent. — Reid J. Epstein Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill Biden, will visit Kenosha, Wis., on Thursday, his campaign announced, a place that is reeling from the police shooting of a Black man and subsequent protests that at times turned destructive. President Trump visited Kenosha on Tuesday. The Biden campaign said Mr. Biden would “hold a community meeting in Kenosha to bring together Americans to heal and address the challenges we face.” After that, he and Dr. Biden will make another stop in Kenosha. The campaign did not provide further details about their plans. The trip comes as Mr. Biden is ramping up his travel schedule in the final two months of the campaign, following a long stretch during the pandemic when he made only occasional in-person appearances and rarely strayed beyond Delaware and eastern Pennsylvania. — Katie Glueck and Thomas Kaplan President Trump’s advance team wanted to show him commiserating with the owners of a burned-out camera shop during his Tuesday visit to Kenosha, Wis. The only problem: the owners wanted nothing to do with Mr. Trump. So the White House did the next best thing — it found the store’s former owner, who still owns the building that housed it before it was destroyed, and passed him off as a business owner aggrieved by the city’s unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake. “I just feel that this is another photo op for him and I just didn’t want to be part of it,” said Tom Gram, a co-owner of Rode’s Camera Shop in Kenosha. “Just to have words put in my mouth or whatever, I just didn’t want that to happen.” Mr. Gram said in a Wednesday interview that he did not return a phone call from the White House advance team seeking to arrange for him to appear with Mr. Trump. But John Rode III, whose family started the business in 1911 and sold it to Mr. Gram and a partner in 2012, did show the building on Roosevelt Road, in Kenosha’s Uptown section, to the president and appeared at a round table discussion at a local high school. “John Rode III, owner of Rode’s Camera Shop,” Mr. Trump said while introducing Mr. Rode. “John, stand up, please.” Mr. Rode proceeded to thank Mr. Trump and local law enforcement for doing “an awesome job.” In an interview Wednesday, Mr. Rode said he did not hear Mr. Trump’s introduction at the time but watched a recording afterward. “He introduced me as the business owner and I didn’t correct him,” Mr. Rode said. “People say you shouldn’t correct him anyway.” Mr. Gram, 63, has known Mr. Rode for decades. He began working at the camera shop in 1979, on the day he graduated from Milwaukee Area Technical College, before buying the business in 2012. He said he has been inundated with press requests and hate mail since the discrepancy was first reported Tuesday night by WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee. “I’m a quiet person. I don’t like to get involved in politics,” he said. “I got my first hate email last night. It’s very difficult for me. I’ve had difficulty sleeping ever since the store was burned.” Mr. Rode, 68, said he remained undecided about whether to vote for Mr. Trump this November but the opportunity to interact with him was something he could not pass up. “I was not in any way trying to make it look like I owned the business,” Mr. Rode said. “I’ve only done what I thought was best for them. I feel like Tom has kind of stabbed me in the back a little bit.” Mr. Gram said he was no fan of Mr. Trump’s style and rhetoric, which he said dismissed the concerns of Kenoshans to make a broader political point in defense of police officers. “I’ve always felt safe in Kenosha,” he said. “He needs to look at the other side of the story too. We’re a community here and we need to heal and we need to grow. I feel that he is too divisive and just needs to work with us.” — Reid J. Epstein In a week that has already seen President Trump visit the site of the country’s latest protests against police violence and a major speech from former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.  confronting the president and condemning the sporadic violence that has erupted in some cities, the two campaigns are now engaged in an advertising war over law and order. The Trump campaign on Wednesday morning released two ads it said would air in Minnesota and Wisconsin that aim to tie Mr. Biden to protests over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. “Lawless criminals terrorize Kenosha,” the Wisconsin ad states. “Joe Biden takes a knee.” The new Trump spots come a day after the Biden campaign unveiled a 60-second ad that repackaged elements of the speech he gave Monday in Pittsburgh condemning the violence that sprang from some protests against systemic racism in policing. The ad — part of a $45 million one-week television and digital purchase that is by far the campaign’s largest to date — is the first time that Mr. Biden has put this pushback on issues of crime and public safety into a major paid advertising program. “I want to make it absolutely clear,” Mr. Biden says as images flash of burned-out cars and buildings and a confrontation with the police. “Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. And those who do it should be prosecuted.” The composition of the ads make clear what each campaign views as their most valuable assets. The Biden spot is narrated entirely by the former vice president as footage of him speaking is spliced together with footage of Trump supporters attacking protesters and marching in Charlottesville, Va. He casts himself as a unifying figure who would seek to “lower the temperature” of the national debate and bring the country together. The Trump ads show Mr. Biden along with Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, progressive women of color Mr. Trump and his allies regularly employ as political boogeymen, as well as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another frequent target. Mr. Trump’s 30-second spot goes on to suggest Mr. Biden agrees with calls to defund the police, which he does not. Mr. Biden has called for increasing funding for law enforcement. The Biden campaign said the ad would air nationally on cable television and in local markets in nine battleground states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Trump campaign did not disclose how much money it is spending on the spots or in which markets they will appear. — Reid J. Epstein and Shane Goldmacher Joseph R. Biden Jr., pressing his argument that President Trump is failing the country with his handling of the coronavirus, plans on Wednesday to make the case that Mr. Trump is hurting the nation’s parents, teachers and schoolchildren with his push for schools to reopen. Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, a community college professor, are scheduled to receive a briefing in Wilmington, Del., from a group of experts, including Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who served as secretary of health and human services for President Barack Obama and is now the president of American University, and Linda Darling-Hammond, the president of the California State Board of Education. Mr. Biden will then give a speech on what his campaign described as Mr. Trump’s failures on the pandemic as well as Mr. Biden’s plan to reopen schools safely. Symone Sanders, a senior adviser for the Biden campaign, said Mr. Trump was “barreling forward trying to reopen schools because he thinks it will help his own re-election.” “We believe this is a key contrast for voters,” Ms. Sanders said. “President Trump, who continues to ignore the science and has no plan to get the virus under control, and Joe Biden, who is working with the experts and putting together an effective plan to beat the virus and reopen schools safely.” Mr. Trump has demanded that schools reopen this fall and threatened to cut federal funding for school districts that defied his wishes. But his effort to pressure schools did not have the effect he desired, and many districts decided to begin the school year with remote instruction. — Thomas Kaplan As Iowa sees a spike in coronavirus cases, Joni Ernst, the state’s junior senator and a Republican in a tight race for re-election, echoed a debunked conspiracy theory that deaths were being greatly inflated and suggested that health care providers had a financial motive to falsify cases. Ms. Ernst said she was “so skeptical” of the government’s national statistics about virus fatalities, according to an account in The Courier newspaper of a campaign stop she made in Waterloo, a city of about 70,000. “They’re thinking there may be 10,000 or less deaths that were actually singularly Covid-19,” Ms. Ernst said. “I’m just really curious. It would be interesting to know that.” According to a tracking project by The New York Times, Iowa has had the most new virus cases per capita of any state over the last seven days. Ames and Iowa City, home to Iowa State University and the University of Iowa, rank second and fourth nationally among metro areas with the most cases per capita over the past two weeks. Ms. Ernst’s comments seemed to track a false claim spread by President Trump over the weekend, and removed by Twitter for violating disinformation rules, because it is linked to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. The claim, retweeted by Mr. Trump, inaccurately said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “quietly updated the Covid number to admit that only 6%” of deaths — or about 9,000 people — “actually died from Covid.” The claim was apparently based on a CDC data table updated last week showing 161,332 death certificates that listed Covid-19 as a cause of death. In 6 percent of cases, Covid-19 was the only cause of death. The other 94 percent included underlying conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes. On Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, made clear that just because a person had other health problems, or comorbidities, along with the coronavirus it does not mean that they did not die of Covid-19. “It’s not 9,000 deaths from Covid-19, it’s 180-plus-thousand deaths,” he said, adding that there should “not be any confusion about that.’’ On Monday, Ms. Ernst, who is fending off a stiff challenge from her Democratic opponent, Theresa Greenfield, also suggested doctors and hospitals had a financial incentive to inflate coronavirus statistics. “These health-care providers and others are reimbursed at a higher rate if Covid is tied to it, so what do you think they’re doing?” she told voters. — Trip Gabriel Senator Edward J. Markey turned back a primary challenge Tuesday from Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, handing the Kennedy family its first-ever electoral loss in Massachusetts and demonstrating the growing strength of the progressive left. Forging a coalition of younger and more liberal Democrats, the sort of voters who once formed the core of the Kennedy base, Mr. Markey was winning about 54 percent of the vote when Mr. Kennedy called him to concede. Soon afterward, The Associated Press declared him the winner. Mr. Markey had 55.5 percent of the vote as of Wednesday morning. By winning renomination in a generational clash — and the marquee Democratic Senate primary of the year — Mr. Markey, 74, proved that the ascendant left is not eager to simply throw out long-serving incumbents in favor of younger rivals, such as the 39-year-old Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Markey, who was first elected to Congress in 1976, was able to outflank Mr. Kennedy with progressives, leaving the heir of Massachusetts’s most storied political dynasty little opening. The mail and TV blitz that Mr. Kennedy deployed in recent weeks that depicted his grandfather, Robert F. Kennedy, and great-uncles did little to affect the outcome. He was uneasy from the start of the campaign about trading on his legacy, a reluctance that mystified some of his allies, who thought he was not wielding his most enviable asset. Mr. Kennedy’s more fundamental problem, however, may have been that he simply never gave voters a coherent reason for why he should replace Mr. Markey, who was generally well-liked and underestimated by many Massachusetts Democrats. Satisfied with their incumbent, happy to see him embrace a progressive agenda and wary of Mr. Kennedy’s ambitions, the state’s many liberal voters made the difference. Mr. Markey won with overwhelming margins in the tony suburbs outside Boston, including Mr. Kennedy’s Newton, and in the college towns of Western Massachusetts. In the other most closely watched race of the night, though, the left fell short. Representative Richard E. Neal, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and dean of Massachusetts’s House delegation, fended off Alex Morse, a liberal who is the mayor of Holyoke. Mr. Neal, who enjoyed a sizable financial advantage, held up his clout in Washington and benefited from the relative scarcity of upscale liberals in his Western Massachusetts district. Every progressive primary challenger who has unseated a House Democrat in the last two elections has done so in and around big cities. And in the tight seven-way race for the seat Mr. Kennedy is vacating, in the Fourth District, the progressive front-runner, Jesse Mermell, was trailing Jake Auchincloss, a Marine veteran endorsed by The Boston Globe, by about 1150 votes as of Wednesday morning. Ms. Mermell was endorsed by Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, while Mr. Auchincloss is a former Republican who ran closer to the center. — Jonathan Martin and Andy Newman The Russian group that interfered in the 2016 presidential election is at it again, using a network of fake accounts and a website set up to look like a left-wing news site, Facebook and Twitter said on Tuesday. The disinformation campaign by the Kremlin-backed group, known as the Internet Research Agency, is the first public evidence that the agency is trying to repeat its efforts from four years ago and push voters away from the Democratic presidential candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., to help President Trump. Intelligence agencies have warned for months that Russia and other countries were actively trying to disrupt the November election, and that Russian intelligence agencies were feeding conspiracy theories designed to alienate Americans by laundering them through fringe sites and social media. Now Facebook and Twitter are offering evidence of this meddling, even as the White House in recent weeks has sought to more tightly control the flow of information about foreign threats to November’s election and downplay Russian interference. The Trump administration’s top intelligence official as recently as Sunday has tried to suggest that China is a graver risk than Moscow. Facebook and Twitter, which were slow to react to wide-ranging disinformation campaigns on their services in 2016 and continue to face criticism — even from their own employees — that they are not doing enough to confront the issue, said they were warned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the Russian effort. — Sheera Frenkel and Julian E. Barnes President Trump has never let go of a baseless accusation that Democrats use mail voting to “steal” elections, a piece of disinformation he has promoted all year, including at the Republican National Convention. Now, with the coronavirus pandemic driving an explosion in absentee voting, and polls suggesting that far more Democrats than Republicans plan to vote by mail, a nightmare scenario haunts Democratic strategists and elected officials. What if early results in swing states on election night show the president in the lead because most Republicans voted in person, yet in the days afterward, as mail ballots that tilt heavily Democratic are tallied, states flip to Joseph R. Biden Jr.? Would Mr. Trump claim premature victory — as he did on behalf of the two Florida Republicans and dangled as a possibility in a tweet in July: “Must know Election results on the night of the Election, not days, months, or even years later!” Would the president, joined by allies in the G.O.P. and the news media, sow distrust in the election by arguing that mail ballots that shift states away from him are “rigged”? Mr. Trump has been pushing denunciations of mailed-in votes for months, and his penchant for conspiracy theories is only intensifying, such as saying this week that people in “dark shadows” are behind Mr. Biden’s campaign. The nightmare scenario in November is worth preparing for, many Democrats say. “We’ve certainly seen candidates trying to get out in front of a narrative and declare victory when all the votes have not been counted,” said Jocelyn Benson, Michigan’s secretary of state, a Democrat whom Mr. Trump has attacked for promoting mail voting. Ms. Benson and other Democrats in Michigan and Pennsylvania, both key battlegrounds, are trying to change election laws that prohibit absentee ballots from being processed or counted before Election Day. As of now, mail-in votes from large Democratic cities like Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Detroit are not reported until after in-person votes, sometimes days later. Party lawyers are girding for a worst-case scenario in which Mr. Trump fights in courts and state legislatures after declaring a premature victory. — Trip Gabriel President Trump’s relationship with voting by mail is full of contradictions. The president himself votes by mail, as do at least 16 members of his inner circle. But he has repeatedly pushed false arguments about the practice, which he has claimed will lead to “the greatest rigged election in history.” That could explain why his campaign has spent $200,000 on Facebook ads since May disparaging voting by mail, with baseless accusations of Democrats “stuffing the ballot boxes with fake and fraudulent votes” — and has also pumped $650,000 into Facebook ads over the past week encouraging his supporters to request absentee ballots. “President Trump needs you to request your ballot,” say dozens of new ads that began running last week. “This is the Election of our LIFETIME.” The seemingly divergent messaging in Mr. Trump’s digital apparatus underscores the threat he may be posing to his own campaign: As he attacks mail-in voting, he could also be hampering his own supporters’ enthusiasm for embracing the method, which will be critical for voters who want to avoid going to the polls on Election Day because of the coronavirus pandemic. A gap in mail-in ballot requests between Republicans and Democrats could be important in November. And so, while the president has continued to rail against the practice, the Trump campaign has concurrently maintained an ad presence boosting mail-in voting for months. The campaign has run roughly 3,800 ads on Facebook since 2018 telling its supporters to “request your ballot,” according to Facebook’s ad database. By running ads on Facebook, the Trump campaign can target its message in favor of absentee voting more directly to its own supporters, without drawing as much public attention as a campaign speech or television ad might. Critics say Mr. Trump is trying to undermine voting by mail in part because he wants to sow doubt about the election and lay the groundwork for questioning the outcome should he lose. The Trump campaign said Tuesday that the president opposed “universal mail-in voting systems,” in which states automatically mail ballots to all voters, but supported “traditional absentee vote-by-mail systems,” in which voters must proactively request ballots themselves. But while broader mail-in voting has led to delayed results in some states this year, and some voters have had their ballots rejected, often because they were not postmarked in time, there has been no evidence of widespread fraud or criminal malfeasance. Cases of fraud have been exceptionally rare in states that have conducted elections primarily by mail for years. — Nick Corasaniti At the Democratic National Convention, viewers heard from an Arizona man whose young son was born with a congenital heart defect, a Wisconsin woman with an autoimmune disease and cancer survivors from several states. Their stories highlighted the importance of health care — and the protections provided by the Affordable Care Act. When Republicans held their convention last week, they had little to say about their own vision for America’s health care system. Obamacare, for years a punching bag for the party, went almost entirely unmentioned. When the phrase “health care” was spoken, it was often in the service of attacking Democrats over health care for undocumented immigrants. Those dueling approaches to discussing health policy offered a preview of what to expect as the two parties, and their presidential nominees, make their closing arguments on one of the most critical issues to many voters — one whose importance has been underscored by the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed at least 184,000 people in the United States. Democrats are once again trying to capitalize on an issue that was key to their success in the 2018 midterm elections. And Republicans are once again vulnerable: Three years after failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the party still has not coalesced around a plan for the future of America’s health care system. “No one could quite figure out what ‘replace’ was,” said Adam Brandon, the president of FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group, as he recalled the party’s struggle to repeal the law known as Obamacare after President Trump’s election. “That’s where the problem was, and we never recovered from it. And we still haven’t recovered from it today.” Mr. Brandon cited the successful health care message employed by Democrats in 2018, with its emphasis on protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and likened it to a football team that calls a running play that proves successful — and then keeps calling the same play. “If I’m the Democrats,” he said, “I just keep handing the ball off on pre-existing conditions until Republicans prove they can stop that.” — Thomas Kaplan The Trump administration announced an order on Tuesday to bar evictions for most renters for the rest of the year. The order, put forward by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the action was needed to stop the spread of the coronavirus and to avoid having renters wind up in shelters or other crowded living conditions. The moratorium would go further than the eviction ban under the CARES Act, the pandemic response legislation that covered as many as 12.3 million renters in apartment complexes or single-family homes financed with federally backed mortgages. That provision expired in July, and negotiations on Capitol Hill to renew aspects of the CARES Act have been fruitless. Testifying in front of the House’s special select committee investigating the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the order a “very, very significant action” and differentiated it from a rental assistance program, which would be more costly and require legislation. “Since we don’t have that, the president’s using executive authority, which will allow for a moratorium so that people who are impacted by this don’t get thrown out of their rental homes,” Mr. Mnuchin said. House Democrats have proposed providing up to $100 billion in assistance to enable renters to pay landlords. To apply for the new moratorium, tenants will have to attest to a substantial loss of household income, the inability to pay full rent and best efforts to pay partial rent. Tenants must also stipulate that eviction would be likely to leave them homeless or force them to live with others at close quarters. The order provides for criminal penalties for violations, but it does not relieve tenants of their ultimate obligation to pay rent. The National Low Income Housing Coalition, a policy group focused on affordable housing, welcomed the order but said further action was needed to provide financial relief to struggling renters. The National Multifamily Housing Council, which represents landlords, denounced the moratorium and said it addressed the financial needs of neither renters nor landlords. — Matthew Goldstein and Jacey Fortin President Trump struggled to stay on message as he visited Kenosha.
