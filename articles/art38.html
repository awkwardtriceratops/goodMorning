Biden and Trump Converge on Tampa<br></h1><p id="artcont">A man in the plot to kidnap Michigan’s governor wrote that he wanted to hang Trump and Clinton, F.B.I. said.  As the candidates cross paths in Tampa, starkly different approaches to the virus take center stage. Trailing in Pennsylvania, the Trump camp tries to make it harder to cast a vote. Poll roundup: Biden’s numbers stay strong, as an NBC/Marist survey finds him ahead in Florida. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, blurs the line between government and politics. Has Texas finally become a true presidential battleground state? The Supreme Court allows longer absentee ballot deadlines in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Jon Ossoff calls Perdue ‘a crook’ over stock purchases during a bitter Senate debate in Georgia. What Trump’s disrespectful treatment of Martha McSally says about his own struggles. President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. have waged two very different campaigns during the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Trump has plowed ahead with his aggressive schedule of signature rallies packed with thousands of supporters, while Mr. Biden has proceeded with his socially distanced drive-in gatherings, public health briefings and speeches on unifying the nation. The two have rarely crossed paths, besides the two debate stages. But Mr. Trump has added a Thursday trip to his itinerary in Tampa, Fla. — where Mr. Biden will also appear later in the day — to hold a rally outside a football stadium. For a president lagging in the polls, any chance to sharpen a contrast with his rival with only a few days left in the campaign is a welcome opportunity. And Mr. Trump relishes and values the largely maskless crowds he draws by the thousands. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump posted a video contrasting Mr. Biden’s arrival to a speech in Georgia, where the Democratic nominee appeared before a small group of attendees distanced and demarcated by white circles, with his own arrival in a military helicopter above a large, cheering crowd. In his speeches, the president uses the size of his crowds as evidence that he can’t possibly be losing. The irony is that the same contrast — Mr. Biden’s adhering to public health guidelines while Mr. Trump flouts them — is exactly the message that the former vice president and his Delaware-centered campaign want to send to voters. Poll after poll shows Mr. Biden more trusted than Mr. Trump to handle the pandemic, just as cases are on the rise and the stock market suffered its worst day in months. Guy Cecil, the chairman of the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, said that Mr. Trump’s insistence on holding mass gatherings was “actually hurting himself.” “He is making a difference,” Mr. Cecil said. “He is making people less favorable and less open to voting for him.” For Mr. Trump, holding a rally in Tampa amounts to coming full circle. An event there in March, just as the virus was shutting down large parts of the country, was one of the first that he was reluctantly forced to cancel. “We have over 100,000 requests for tickets, but I think we’ll probably not do it because people would say it’s better to not do,” Mr. Trump said at the time during a bilateral meeting with the prime minister of Ireland. “You know, we need a little separation until such time as this goes away. It’s going to go away. It’s going to go away.” The president turned to someone for consultation. “What is the number as of this morning?” he asked. “Is it 32? You could tell me. Is it 32 deaths?” It was. On Wednesday, The New York Times’s coronavirus tracker showed that the country had reported 227,667 deaths. — Shane Goldmacher President Trump’s campaign is pursuing a three-pronged strategy in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania that would effectively suppress mail-in votes there, moving to stop the processing of absentee votes before Election Day, pushing to limit how late mail-in ballots can be accepted and intimidating Pennsylvanians trying to vote early. The state is one of a handful that by law prevent mail-in votes from being counted until Election Day. In Pennsylvania and other swing states, these ballots are expected to skew heavily toward Democrats. In an effort to accommodate a pandemic-driven avalanche of absentee ballots, Pennsylvania, like many other states, has tried to relax some rules, like the one that requires all votes to be counted within six days after Election Day, by extending the period to nine days. But the Trump campaign has leaned on Republican allies in the legislature to prevent any changes. Among many other lawsuits, the campaign has mounted litigation in state, local and federal courts to curtail how late mail-in votes can be accepted and to challenge other rules and procedures. On Wednesday evening, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a fast-tracked plea from Pennsylvania Republicans to block the three-day extension of the deadline for receiving absentee ballots in the state. The Trump campaign has also dispatched its officials to early voting sites, videotaped voters and even pressed election administrators in the Philadelphia area to stop people from delivering more than one ballot to a drop box. The intensity of the Trump campaign’s efforts in Philadelphia stems in part from the man running its Election Day operations nationwide: Michael Roman, a native Philadelphian who cut his teeth in city politics before running a domestic intelligence-gathering operation for the conservative Koch brothers. Like his boss, Mr. Roman has persistently made public statements undermining confidence in the electoral process. Neither Mr. Roman nor the campaign would comment for this article. Some residents have been left bewildered by the Trump campaign’s attention this year. During the primary election over the summer, Adam S. Goodman, an insurance lawyer, posted a photo on Instagram in which he proudly held up two mail-in ballots outside a drop box. He learned the Trump campaign had used the photo in litigation against the city to illustrate an accusation that some voters were dropping off more than one ballot. But Mr. Goodman said his husband was simply standing out of the frame when the picture was taken. The president, who was in the state Monday, had ominous words for voters there. “A lot of strange things happening in Philadelphia,” he said during a stop in Allentown. “We’re watching you, Philadelphia. We’re watching at the highest level.” Law enforcement officials, at least in Philadelphia, were unbowed by the president’s threats. “Keep your Proud Boys, goon squads and uncertified ‘poll watchers’ out of our city, Mr. President,” Lawrence S. Krasner, the city’s district attorney, said. “Break the law here, and I’ve got something for you.” — Nick Corasaniti and Danny Hakim A trove of polls conducted mostly or entirely after the final presidential debate — which the Trump campaign had hoped would turn around the president’s sagging numbers — landed on Wednesday, and they offered little in the way of encouragement for President Trump. The closest thing to a state poll that qualified as good news was an Ipsos poll showing him down only a point in Arizona. Otherwise, there was little evidence the race was tightening, with five days left before the election — and, crucially, with nearly 80 million Americans already having cast their votes.  An NBC/Marist poll of Florida released this morning did not show Mr. Trump’s prospects brightening in the Sunshine State either. It found Joseph R. Biden Jr. holding a four-point edge over the president among likely voters, with only two percent of respondents saying they were undecided. Mr. Biden’s lead is within the poll’s margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. But it is also in line with polls that have consistently found Mr. Biden slightly ahead of the president in a win-or-die state Mr. Trump carried in 2016. And it represents a gain for Mr. Biden over an NBC/Marist Florida poll conducted in September after the party conventions that had found the candidates tied. Mr. Biden, NBC/Marist found, has opened up a lead over Mr. Trump in Florida among the state’s vast population of older voters — in September, the candidates were essentially tied. Now Mr. Biden is ahead among older voters by seven points. Mr. Biden’s advantage over the president among independent voters there has also edged up, to 14 points from 11, while Mr. Trump continues hold advantages among Florida’s Latino voters (by six percentage points), white voters (seven points), men (10 points) and whites without college degrees (26 points). The poll was conducted from Oct. 25 to Oct. 27, after the Oct. 22 debate. If anything had poll junkies talking yesterday, it was the conflicting results in Wisconsin. ABC News/Washington Post, a high-quality pollster, found Mr. Biden leading by an eyebrow-raising 17 points. Marquette University Law School, perhaps the most trusted pollster in the state, found him leading by five points. It is hard to explain the discrepancy. Wisconsin is a difficult state to poll. It has no party registration and no large racial divide, so it’s not the kind of place where making sure you have the right number of white and Black voters is tantamount to having the right number of Ds and Rs. But these two pollsters, and their polls, are actually quite similar and used the same basic methods.  This suggests that the difference could be just statistical noise: the kind of weird, outlying results you inevitably get with random sampling National polls released by major pollsters yesterday also had positive news for Mr. Biden. YouGov/Economist had him up by 11 points, ticking up from its pre-debate poll. CNN/SSRS had him up by 12, a fine result for him even if it’s a pollster that has put up some particularly strong results for him before. — Nate Cohn and Andy Newman A $265 million Trump administration campaign to “defeat despair” about the coronavirus was planned partly around the politically tinged theme that “helping the president will help the country,” according to documents released on Thursday by House investigators. Administration officials envisioned a star-studded campaign to lift American spirits, but the lawmakers said they sought to exclude celebrities who had supported gay rights or same-sex marriage or who had not favored President Trump. Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee and the select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis released the records, declaring that “these documents include extremely troubling revelations.” They accused Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, of “a cover-up to conceal the Trump administration’s misuse of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars for partisan political purposes ahead of the upcoming election.” The public relations effort — led in part by Michael R. Caputo, the former Health and Human Services official who went on medical leave after posting a rant on Facebook claiming that career government scientists were committing “sedition” to undermine the president — is now in shambles. Celebrities picked to promote the campaign, including the actor Dennis Quaid, have pulled out. Mr. Azar ordered a review of whether the initiative served “important public health purposes.” The new documents deal with a $15 million contract awarded to Atlas Research and indicate that government officials successfully urged the company to hire three little-known subcontractors with no obvious expertise to join the bigger campaign. When Mark H. Chichester, the president of Atlas, tried to research those subcontractors, he discovered “small shops with little on them in the public domain,” according to documents the committee released. One was a one-person operation run by a state-level Republican pollster, Mr. Chichester wrote. Another appeared to be “a small — perhaps one-man” operation. A third was a  owned by a Russian-born business associate of Caputo’s, Mr. Chichester said. In a September meeting with one subcontractor, Mr. Caputo suggested “taglines” for the effort, some of which had a distinctly partisan tone, according to notes released by the lawmakers. Mr. Caputo, a staunch Trump ally, said that theme “would appeal to his base in terms of wearing a mask, vaccine,” the notes state. — Noah Weiland and Sharon LaFraniere Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, has suddenly started appearing on Fox News from a set-up at President Trump’s re-election headquarters, further blurring the lines between government and political activity. In one appearance earlier this week, in which she was announced as both a campaign senior adviser and the White House press secretary, Ms. McEnany talked up the president’s political rallies. “At each of our rallies yesterday, I was with the president, we made three stops on Lancaster and all across the state,” she said in the interview. “And in each of those stops we played a video for the public. Joe Biden said roll the tape, President Trump. When did I say ban fracking? Well, we rolled it.” In the interview, Ms. McEnany did not say she was speaking in a position as a campaign adviser. Nor did the campaign or the White House ever announce that she was serving in both roles. When she left the campaign to become the White House press secretary, it was not made clear that she would continue on helping the campaign. Throughout the campaign the Trump administration has been criticized for blurring lines between government and politics and violating longstanding norms, and, in many cases, the Hatch Act. At the Republican National Convention Mr. Trump delivered his acceptance speech from the South Lawn of the White House, turning the mansion into the backdrop for a political speech. The Office of the U.S. Special Counsel is investigating whether Secretary of State Mike Pompeo violated the Hatch Act, a law that bans political activity in the federal workplace, by helping the Trump campaign in the course of his official duties, including by speaking to the Republican National Convention while on a diplomatic trip to Jerusalem. Other administrations have found ways to deal with dividing the political and the governmental, such as when President Obama was running for re-election and Jay Carney, the White House press secretary at the time, would brief reporters traveling with Mr. Obama, while a campaign official, Jennifer Psaki, would brief the reporters on behalf of the campaign, a former Obama-era aide recalled. Ms. McEnany’s recent appearances have become an encapsulation of the administration’s willingness to blur lines. Sarah Matthews, a White House spokeswoman, said that Ms. McEnany “appeared on Fox News and Fox Business in her personal capacity as a private citizen. She advises the campaign on a voluntary basis.” A campaign official said that shows that air interviews with her have been instructed not to use her White House title. Mr. Trump has expressed frustration that he has few people on television defending him beyond the White House chief-of-staff, Mark Meadows, comparing it to 2016, when he had his former White House adviser, Kellyanne Conway, on television constantly in the final stretch. He has also complained to aides that Ms. McEnany only goes on Fox News. — Maggie Haberman TRANSCRIPT I feel very confident that Joe Biden will be elected president on Tuesday, whatever the end count is. But on the election that occurs on Tuesday, he will be elected. On Jan. 20, he will be inaugurated president of the United States. So while we don’t want to be overconfident or assume anything, we have to be ready for how we are going to go down a different path. We’ve come to a fork in the road when it comes to the coronavirus. The president has taken us on a deadly path. The Heroes Act takes us on a scientific path to help save the lives, the livelihood and the lives of the American people. This weekend should be very interesting to see how many more people will vote in advance. I hope that people will not depend on the mail because they have done all they can to dismantle the postal system. But I salute our postal workers, our letter carriers and those who are making the best of the situation. But even the Postal Service is saying it’s too late now to mail. Well I want, I want a bill for two reasons. First and foremost, the American people need help, they need real help. And second of all, we have plenty work to do in the Joe Biden administration. We’re going to build the infrastructure of America in a green way. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi predicted on Thursday that Democrats would win back the White House and said she was already making preparations for a Joseph R. Biden Jr. presidency. “I feel very confident that Joe Biden will be elected president on Tuesday,” Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, told reporters at her last news conference before Election Day. She spent much of it savaging President Trump for leading the country down a “deadly path” by failing to take the coronavirus threat seriously. “So while we don’t want to be overconfident or assume anything,” she added, “we have to be ready for how we’re going to go down a different path.” Ms. Pelosi said that meant pushing to complete a sweeping coronavirus relief bill in Congress’s lame duck session after the election, rather than waiting for Mr. Biden to take office should he win. “I want a bill for two reasons,” the speaker said. “First and foremost, the American people need help, they need real help. Second of all, we have plenty to do in a Joe Biden administration.” Democrats’ agenda would depend heavily on whether they also win control of the Senate, but Ms. Pelosi laid out several early priorities. They included an infrastructure bill focused on creating green jobs, legislation building up the Affordable Care Act, and an omnibus anti-corruption bill House Democrats assembled last year. “We want to have as clean a slate as possible going into January,” she said. Democrats, Senate Republicans and the White House have struggled to reach a deal for months, as Democrats have tried to pull the administration toward their own $3.4 trillion plan. Earlier Thursday, the speaker had written to Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, requesting a response to key outstanding differences in the talks around such a bill. But it is far from clear that impasse can be broken in the weeks after the election, particularly if Mr. Trump loses or contests the outcome. Ms. Pelosi, accusing Republicans of trying to depress the vote, also urged Americans using absentee ballots to drop them off in person rather than relying on the Postal Service. “I hope that people will not depend on the mail because they have done all they can to dismantle the postal system,” she said of the Republicans who control the agency. “Even the Postal Service is saying it’s too late now to mail.” — Nicholas Fandos When Senator Ted Cruz of Texas spoke with President Trump on the phone last week, he congratulated him on his debate performance, nudged him to keep driving policy-oriented attacks against his opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., and relayed one more message. “We have a fight” in Texas, Mr. Cruz said he told Mr. Trump, warning him that the country’s second-largest electoral prize was in play and that he should take it seriously. In an interview, Mr. Cruz said he expected the president to win here — but that he also saw the same surging liberal energy in his state that had propelled Beto O’Rourke to a closer-than-expected defeat against him two years ago. “There’s no doubt that it’s a real race,” said the senator, echoing a similar case Mr. O’Rourke made to Mr. Biden earlier this month in their own phone conversation. But it’s not clear if Mr. Trump or Mr. Biden fully believe it. They may be on opposite sides of the partisan divide, but Texas Republicans and Democrats alike believe the long-awaited moment has arrived: The state is a true presidential battleground, and either candidate could prevail next week. Although a Democrat has not carried Texas since 1976, recent public and private polls suggest a highly competitive race, with some surveys showing Mr. Biden up narrowly and others showing Mr. Trump enjoying a small lead. Yet even as leading figures in both parties urge their respective presidential nominees to take Texas seriously, the campaigns are still reluctant to spend precious remaining time and money there. Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Biden is expected to appear in the state before the election. Though the state isn’t essential to a Biden victory, Democrats have been more aggressive in the state. Mr. Biden is dispatching his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, to Texas on Friday, and Democrats have also planned a multicity bus tour across the state. A Biden win would doom Mr. Trump’s chances for re-election. More significantly, it would herald the arrival of a formidable multiracial Democratic coalition in the country’s largest red state. That would hand the Democrats an electoral upper hand nationwide and all but block Republicans from the White House until they improve their fortunes with college-educated white voters, younger people and minorities. — Jonathan Martin In a pair of decisions welcomed by Democrats, the Supreme Court on Wednesday at least temporarily let election officials in two key battleground states, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, accept absentee ballots for several days after Election Day. In the Pennsylvania case, the court refused a plea from Pennsylvania Republicans that it decide before Election Day whether the state can continue counting absentee ballots for three days after Nov. 3. In the North Carolina case, the court let stand a lower court ruling that allowed the state’s board of elections to extend the deadline to nine days after Election Day, up from the three days called for by state legislators. The court’s brief orders in the two cases were unsigned and gave no reasons. The two cases involved broadly similar issues. In Pennsylvania, the question was whether the state’s Supreme Court could override voting rules set by the state legislature. In North Carolina, the question was whether state election officials had the power to alter such voting rules. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the court on Tuesday, did not take part in either case. A court spokeswoman said Justice Barrett said she had not participated “because of the need for a prompt resolution of it and because she has not had time to fully review the parties’ filings.” — Adam Liptak One of the men accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan’s governor also wrote on Facebook that he wanted to hang President Trump, Hillary Clinton,  and other politicians from both parties, an F.B.I. agent said. The threats were reported in a new court filing in U.S. District Court in Delaware. The agent wrote that Barry Croft, a Delaware truck driver who was one of 13 men charged earlier this month with plotting to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, had indicated that he wanted to hang or hold a “people’s trial” against a wide range of politicians. “I say we hang everything currently governing us, they’re all guilty,” Mr. Croft wrote in May, according to the F.B.I. That month, Mr. Croft also posted a photo of Mr. Trump, according to the agent, with the message,  “True colors shining through,” he wrote, and using an abbreviated obscenity for Mr. Trump, added, “wanna hang” him, too. The agent said that a month later, Mr. Croft wrote, “I’m for hanging Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians. I believe the rest would enjoy the Constitutional Republic!!!” Also in June, Mr. Croft indicated that the four most recent presidents — Mr. Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton — should be hung, the agent said. The revelations were shared in an affidavit from Kristopher M. Long, an F.B.I. agent who last week persuaded a judge to give the agency access to a Facebook account they believed Mr. Croft ran. In the affidavit, Mr. Long said Facebook had removed Mr. Croft’s previous accounts at least twice, but that he created new ones and continued to message others about carrying out attacks and to post publicly about his desire that politicians die. No lawyer is listed for Mr. Croft in court documents, and a lawyer who previously represented him would not comment. Mr. Croft also apparently threatened other governors, Mr. Long wrote. In one post in May, Mr. Croft shared a picture of Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina and asked his followers, “This our guy?” According to the F.B.I., Mr. Croft also sent a Facebook message indicating that Mr. McMaster, a Republican, “may be first” and saying that he was going to Columbia, S.C., that Friday with a sword. Mr. Long noted in the affidavit that a protest against coronavirus restrictions was scheduled around that time in South Carolina. Ms. Whitmer, the Michigan governor, had also faced large protests against her coronavirus measures. Another F.B.I. agent said in court this month that the men who planned to attack Ms. Whitmer also discussed targeting Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, a Democrat, over his pandemic restrictions. Michigan, with a fervent gun culture and a big divide between rural and urban areas, is viewed by some experts as fertile ground for anti-government groups, many of which style themselves as militias. On Thursday, Dana Nessel, the Michigan attorney general, announced that she had charged two men who she said were members of a white supremacist organization with “unlawful posting of a message” and “gang membership” stemming from an incident in December. Ms. Nessel said the men had posted pictures of a house that they mistakenly thought was the home of a podcast host in an effort to intimidate him. — Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Neil MacFarquhar The Republican National Committee is going on the air in two battleground states in the final days before the election with an ad campaign that acknowledges two issues President Trump has often ignored or insisted are irrelevant: the coronavirus pandemic and high unemployment. The ad, which will run in Michigan and North Carolina, is much softer in tone than many of Mr. Trump’s commercials. It avoids altogether the divisive racial and cultural themes that have dominated his campaign and run through his messaging, instead focusing on traditional bread-and-butter Republican issues like taxes and job creation. On the screen, a woman wearing a mask stands at a voting machine mulling how she will cast her ballot. “What about the Democrats?” she asks. “Higher taxes on employers? But my husband is looking for work.” Then she lists a number of proposals that have backing from liberal Democrats but that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. does not support, which she describes in the language that Republicans often use: “government-run health care” and “ending private insurance.” The woman then looks at the Republican side of her ballot. “Protect Medicare. Keep taxes low. More job creation,” she says, declaring, “This choice is clear.” The ad does not mention Mr. Trump or Mr. Biden by name because the R.N.C. has exhausted the spending limit under federal law that regulates coordinated spending between the party and the nominee. Its departure from the president’s message couldn’t be clearer. Many of his ads have focused on scenes of violent protests and depicted a potential Biden presidency as one that would hobble the police and embolden lawlessness. The R.N.C. is putting $3.2 million behind the ad. — Jeremy W. Peters U.S. economic output grew at the fastest pace on record last quarter as businesses began to reopen and customers returned to stores. But the economy has climbed only partway out of its pandemic-induced hole, and progress is slowing. Gross domestic product — the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the United States — grew 7.4 percent in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday — the biggest single-quarter gain since reliable statistics began after World War II. The Trump campaign touted the gain as an “absolute validation of President Trump’s policies, which create jobs and opportunities for Americans in every corner of the country,” and the president shouted on Twitter that as long as he is re-elected, next year will be “FANTASTIC!!!” GDP number just announced. Biggest and Best in the History of our Country, and not even close. Next year will be FANTASTIC!!! However, Sleepy Joe Biden and his proposed record setting tax increase, would kill it all. So glad this great GDP number came out before November 3rd. For most of the campaign, one of the few bright spots in polling for Mr. Trump was that Americans thought he would do a better job than Joseph R. Biden Jr. steering the economy for the next four years, though that advantage has largely evaporated. The stock market has fallen this week as the pandemic explodes anew, so the president is keen to have something to boast about. But economists said the third-quarter figures revealed less about the strength of the recovery than about the severity of the collapse that preceded it. G.D.P. fell 10 percent over the first two quarters as the pandemic hit. A big rebound was inevitable once the economy began to reopen. The challenge is what comes next. “The reason we had such a big bounce is that the economy went from closed to partially open,” said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America. “The easy growth was exhausted, and now the hard work has to be done in terms of fully healing.” Moreover, monthly data indicates that progress slowed over the course of the third quarter, a slowdown most economists expect to worsen in the final three months of the year as virus cases rise and federal aid to households and businesses fades. “It looks like economic momentum is fading in the fourth quarter,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist for TD Securities. The weekly report on new unemployment claims was also released this morning. It showed a slight decrease from last week, another sign that the economic recovery remains fragile. The Biden campaign was just as lukewarm on the economic numbers as the Trump campaign was red hot. “The recovery is stalling out, thanks to Trump’s refusal to have a serious plan to deal with Covid or to pass a new economic relief plan for workers, small businesses and communities,” the Biden campaign said in a release ahead of Thursday’s report, calling the rebound “a partial return from a catastrophic hit.” — Ben Casselman Jon Ossoff, the Democratic nominee in one of Georgia’s two Senate races, slammed Senator David Perdue, his Republican opponent, as “a crook” on Wednesday night and accused him of trying to profit from the coronavirus pandemic The remark came during a bruising debate that underscored the bitter partisan divide in what was once a safely Republican state. Mr. Perdue, 70, said he had done nothing wrong, and accused Mr. Ossoff, 33, of pursuing a “radical socialist agenda” that would result in higher taxes. Mr. Perdue, a wealthy former corporate executive, bought stock in DuPont de Nemours, which sells personal protective equipment, on Jan. 24, the same day he received a classified briefing on the threat posed by the coronavirus, according to a report in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “It’s not just that you’re a crook, Senator,” Mr. Ossoff said, turning to face his socially-distanced opponent as Mr. Perdue’s eyes remained fixed on the camera. “It’s that you’re attacking the health of the people that you represent. You did say Covid-19 was no deadlier than the flu. You did say there would be no significant uptick in cases. All the while you were looking after your own assets and your own portfolio.” Mr. Perdue has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and said any transactions he made were executed by a financial adviser without his knowledge. “The thing I’m most upset about,” Mr. Perdue said of Mr. Ossoff, “is that he’ll say and do anything to my friends in Georgia to mislead them about how radical and socialist” his agenda is. Recent polls have found Mr. Perdue in a dead heat with Mr. Ossoff. If neither candidate hits 50 percent of the vote, they will face a runoff election in January. — Glenn Thrush TRANSCRIPT “A woman who is running for the Senate currently, a senator respected by everybody. Her opponent wants to terminate your Second Amendment. Martha McSally, Martha — [cheering] Right, right, Martha — Martha, come up just fast. Quick, quick! [cheering] Fast! Fast! Come on! Quick! You got one minute — one minute! Martha say, they don’t want to hear this, Martha. Come on! Let’s go! Quick quick, quick, quick! Come on. Let’s go.” “Great, I’m coming. Thank you, President Trump. Arizona, we are ground zero. to save the country. We have six days, and just a few hours.” President Trump’s dismissive and disrespectful treatment of his nominal political ally Senator Martha McSally in Arizona on Wednesday was cast by local media as a humiliating coda to her difficult campaign. But it said just as much about Mr. Trump’s own stumble down the stretch, exacerbated by an unwillingness to take even the most basic steps to improve his shaky standing among women voters. All Mr. Trump had to do in Goodyear, Ariz., was introduce Ms. McSally, a fellow Republican, and smile when she offered a unity pitch. No go. After starting by saying she was “respected by everybody,” he instantly proved that she was not. “Martha, come up just fast! Fast! Fast! Come on. Quick! You got one minute!” he shouted, as some, but not all, in the crowd laughed. “One minute, Martha! They don’t want to hear this, Martha. Come on. Let’s go. Quick, quick, quick, quick. Come on. Let’s go.” Ms. McSally ran on the stage, elbow-bumped the president, and professed herself “proud” of him, after declining to do so at a debate earlier this month. This might have been the reason he was so eager to see her come and go. (Ms. McSally wrote in an op-ed this week that she was supporting Mr. Trump’s re-election.) Ms. McSally, a former fighter pilot appointed to her current seat, trails her Democratic opponent, Mark Kelly, in polls, and she is underperforming Mr. Trump in Arizona. But Mr. Trump is also underperforming his 2016 self in a state he won by 3.5 points four years ago. A big part of the reason, in the Sun Belt and elsewhere, is the defection of white suburban women, who have been driven away by a number of factors, particularly his failure to manage the coronavirus pandemic and the way that he speaks about women. He did little to address either vulnerability on Wednesday. “Biden and the Democrat socialists will delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, shutter your schools and shut down our country,” Trump told the audience, tightly packed and intermittently masked. “And your state is open right? Your state is nice and open.” Then came the McSally moment. The clip, which dominated local news coverage and social media, provided a brutal visual representation of Mr. Trump’s core political problem. Here he was physically rushing a suburban woman off the stage, and placing a strict time limit on her opportunity to speak — a limit he has never imposed on himself. What happened next underscored the slight even more vividly. After Ms. McSally spoke, Mr. Trump invited three male out-of-state supporters — Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky,  Representative Kevin McCarthy of California and Senator Mike Lee of Utah — onstage for unrushed appearances that focused on their adulation of him. — Glenn Thrush Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, clashed on Wednesday with Sara Gideon, her Democratic opponent and the speaker of the state house, in the final debate of the race. The two women battled over the handling of the pandemic and how to provide health care to thousands of voters, and they traded accusations over negative ads and attached each other’s records. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report has rated the Maine Senate race a tossup, but several polls — including a New York Times/Siena College poll released in September — have found Ms. Collins, who is seeking a fifth term, trailing Ms. Gideon. Ms. Collins is facing the toughest re-election contest of her career, in part because her decisive vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in 2018 infuriated moderate voters who had previously supported her. On Wednesday, she defended both her vote to confirm Justice Kavanaugh and her decision to vote against the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett earlier this week, voicing skepticism that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case establishing a woman’s right to obtain an abortion. “I do not think that the Supreme Court is going to strike down Roe v. Wade,” Ms. Collins said, arguing that it has been established as a precedent that people have long relied on. Pressed on whether her vote to confirm Justice Kavanaugh reflected the will of Maine voters, Ms. Collins said “I didn’t take a poll.” Ms. Collins highlighted her work in approving nearly $3 trillion in legislation earlier this year and accused Ms. Gideon, as she has in the past, of failing to provide for Maine during the pandemic. (The Maine State House adjourned in March and has not yet returned.) “I’ll hold our record in the State Legislature up to the record of Senator Collins and the G.O.P. Senate any day,” Ms. Gideon shot back, pointing out that Congress has failed to reach an agreement on another relief package. Ms. Gideon, for her part, sought to frame the race as a referendum on the national leadership in Washington, repeatedly tying Ms. Collins to both Mr. Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, characterizations Ms. Collins dismissed. And like other Democratic candidates, Ms. Gideon argued that she would do a better job of protecting health care for voters, particularly given that the Supreme Court is set to hear a case in the coming days that could overturn the Affordable Care Act. “I will not stop fighting until we have health care that is affordable and accessible to everyone,” Ms. Gideon said. “This is why I am running for the Senate today, and this is what we have to see through.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
