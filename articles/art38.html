The Bidens paid $288,000 in federal income taxes for 2019. Team Biden: Forget about the gaffes and focus on falsehoods. What the polls say about issues likely to be raised in tonight’s debate. Amy Coney Barrett meets with Senator Mitch McConnell, who hopes to speed her confirmation to the Supreme Court. A big clue to how Biden and Trump will do tonight: their performances in past debates. 84 million is the number to beat for tonight’s debate to set a ratings record. What time is the debate? Tune in, or log on, at 9 p.m. Eastern time. Joseph R. Biden Jr. released his 2019 tax returns on Tuesday, which show that he and his wife, Jill, had an adjusted gross income of $985,000 last year and paid federal income taxes of $288,000. Mr. Biden released his latest tax returns hours before the first general election debate, and two days after The New York Times reported that President Trump paid only $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and in 2017. That was a tiny fraction of what the Bidens paid those years, according to tax returns they had previously made public. They paid $91,000 in federal income taxes in 2016, when they had an adjusted gross income of $396,000, and they paid $3.7 million in 2017, when their adjusted gross income was $11 million. The following year, in 2018, they paid $1.5 million in federal income taxes and had an adjusted gross income of $4.6 million. Mr. Biden’s release of his most recent tax return seemed timed to place even more focus on Mr. Trump’s taxes and keep him on the defensive about them going into the debate. In addition to $288,000 in federal income taxes, the Bidens paid nearly $12,000 in other federal taxes, for a total of just under $300,000. Mr. Biden has now released returns covering the past 22 years. His running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, also released her 2019 tax returns on Tuesday, which come in addition to 15 years of returns she released last year. “This is a historic level of transparency meant to give the American people faith, once again, that their leaders will look out for them and not their own bottom line,” Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, said on a call with reporters. Mr. Trump did not release his tax returns when he ran for president as the Republican nominee in 2016, breaking with modern tradition, and has refused to do so since then. Mr. Biden had previously criticized Mr. Trump for not releasing his tax returns. And this week, the Biden campaign quickly sought to capitalize on the revelations about Mr. Trump’s taxes, releasing a video showing the federal income taxes paid by workers like teachers and firefighters and launching a “Trump tax calculator” where people can determine how much more they paid in federal income taxes than the president. — Thomas Kaplan The disclosure that President Trump paid little or no federal income tax for years, including while in the White House, convulsed the presidential campaign with only five weeks to go and immediately scrambled the equation and stakes of the first debate to be held on Tuesday night. While Mr. Trump tried to deflect the news about his taxes, and his Republican allies generally kept their silence, Democrats pounced and Joseph R. Biden Jr., the party’s presidential candidate, posted a video noting that the president had paid less in income taxes than everyday Americans like teachers, firefighters and nurses. How the revelations, published on Sunday and Monday by The New York Times, may change the presidential campaign was an open question. The race has remained remarkably steady and without major shifts through all sorts of seismic developments. But with five weeks until the election on Nov. 3, every day that the president does not transform the dynamics of a campaign that polls show he is currently trailing in is a missed opportunity. “We know the vast majority of Americans long ago made up their minds about President Trump, either for or against him, so the tax revelations are not likely to shift the election in any fundamental way,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. “That said, they could play a role in giving Joe Biden some ammunition for the debate and at the margins for some people who feel that $750 is not enough to pay in taxes regardless of the circumstances.” But there was quiet concern within the campaign, where aides took note of daily tracking numbers from Rasmussen Reports, a typically rosy assessment of how the president is faring, that showed support falling after the tax report. Among Mr. Trump’s circle, there was finger-pointing about how the issue was handled and a hesitancy to discuss with him an issue they know he is sensitive about. Many of the president’s advisers argued that such stories have never harmed his standing with core supporters in the past and that this would be no exception. They recognized, however, that Mr. Trump would have to have an effective response prepared for the debate, the first encounter between the two candidates, scheduled for 9 p.m. Eastern at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. Some aides suggested he try to finesse an answer similar to what he has said previously, that taking advantage of the tax code is simply “smart” for a business person, while also painting himself as a jobs creator. — Peter Baker and Michael D. Shear The first presidential debate was still hours away, but the quadrennial debate about debate rules was already raging in full force, or perhaps full farce. President Trump’s re-election campaign sought to cast doubt on the integrity of the debate even before it began, putting out a statement on Tuesday claiming that the Biden campaign had reversed its decision to allow a “pre-debate inspection for electronic earpieces” and that his campaign had asked for “multiple breaks during the debate.” The Biden campaign denied the accusations. Mr. Trump’s staff “seems concerned that he will not do well tonight, and they’re already laying the groundwork for how they’re going to lie about why,” Kate Bedingfield, a Biden deputy campaign manager, said during a pre-debate call with reporters. “It is completely absurd. Of course he is not wearing an earpiece, and we never asked for breaks.” Pressed on whether the campaign had ever agreed to a pre-debate inspection, Symone Sanders, a senior adviser, said the question was “absolutely ridiculous” and characterized the assertions by the Trump campaign as “false, crazy, random, ridiculous” but did not answer the question. Ms. Bedingfield, seemingly attempting to make a point about spreading disinformation, declared, “If we’re playing that game, then you know, the Trump team asked that Chris Wallace never mention the number of Covid deaths once during the debate.” She added, “You can consider that confirmed from the Biden campaign. See how easy that was to try to throw up a distraction? It is pathetic, it’s weak.” The Biden campaign declined to say if she was serious; the Trump campaign said the claim was untrue. Allies of Joseph R. Biden Jr. are bracing for ugly personal attacks from Mr. Trump on the debate stage — and they know that Mr. Biden has a temper and is deeply protective of his family. Their hope: that Mr. Biden can channel any fury at Mr. Trump’s provocations into righteous anger on behalf of American voters. Mr. Biden — who once called a voter who questioned his son Hunter’s overseas business dealings a “damn liar” — has been known to lash out when under attack. Whether he can do so productively will be among his most important tests on Tuesday. Ms. Sanders said that Mr. Biden would “be focused on speaking directly to the American people,” including about his plan to handle the coronavirus pandemic. And she said Mr. Biden would not be fact-checking Mr. Trump during the debate. “It is not Joe Biden’s job in this debate to fact-check Donald Trump. That’s the moderator’s job. That’s the independent press’s job,” she said. The Biden campaign also announced that his guests at the debate would include Kristin Urquiza, whose Trump-supporting father died of the coronavirus; Gurneé Green, a small-business owner from Ohio; and James Evanoff Jr., a member of the United Steel Workers union. — Sydney Ember, Katie Glueck and Shane Goldmacher Dr. Jill Biden was having none of it. CNN’s Jake Tapper was trying to ask about her husband’s “occasional gaffe” in a pre-debate interview when she cut him off. “Oh, you can’t even go there,” she said. “After Donald Trump, you cannot even say the word gaffe.” “I can’t even say the word gaffe?” Mr. Tapper replied. “Nope. Done. It’s gone,” Dr. Biden pushed back. Mr. Tapper moved on. But for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., his penchant to misspeak, or utter an inopportune or politically incorrect phrase will be under particular scrutiny at Tuesday night’s debate, and he faces a Republican opponent in President Trump who has primed an entire conservative media ecosystem to amplify any missteps. Mr. Trump, of course, has tested even the low standards of American politics with his penchant for repeatedly making false, distorted, misleading or unsubstantiated claims, which the Biden campaign hopes to call attention to. Nor is Mr. Trump immune from misspeaking: as when he recently appeared to pronounce Yosemite as “Yo Semites” at a bill signing. CNN’s @jaketapper to Jill Biden: “Your husband has been known to make the occasional gaffe…”
Biden: “You can’t even go there. After Donald Trump you cannot even say the word gaffe.” #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/bBInkVhm6L But the Trump campaign is gearing up to amplify any Biden gaffes. He has made a few during the election cycle, like when Mr. Biden said an undecided voter this year “ain’t black.” That got a lot of attention in the mainstream media, too. But on Fox News and other conservative outlets, what would otherwise be fleeting moments like Mr. Biden not delivering the Pledge of Allegiance in full have been promoted as signs of cognitive decline. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump’s personal attorney and a former New York mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, accused Mr. Biden of having “dementia” on Fox News, even as he himself mangled what he was accusing Mr. Biden of misspeaking about: “He can’t do the prologue to the, to the, to, ya, to the Constitution of the United States, or the Declaration of Independence. Any of them.” Multiple conspiracy theories have been promoted ahead of the debate to offset a potentially strong showing by Mr. Biden. Mr. Trump has demanded that Mr. Biden undergo testing for performance-enhancing drugs, and Fox News anchors on Tuesday floated, without evidence, the notion of hidden listening devices for Mr. Biden. “We’re going to have to follow that through the day,” Fox’s Brett Baier said. Chris Wallace of Fox News is serving as the debate moderator. It is true that Mr. Biden misspeaks and meanders, perhaps never as memorably as he did when a question about the legacy of slavery during a Democratic debate last year wound back around to record players. Mr. Biden even once called himself a “gaffe machine.” But he said that was better than the incumbent alternative. “My God what a wonderful thing compared to a guy who can’t tell the truth.” — Shane Goldmacher Chris Wallace, the Fox News anchor moderating tonight’s debate, will center the debate around six topics: the Supreme Court, the coronavirus outbreak, the integrity of the election, the economy, “race and violence in our cities” and the two candidates’ political records. Here’s a look at what polling tells us about where the public stands on some of those issues — and how President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. might be able to score points with undecided voters. The Supreme Court vacancy and Roe v. Wade Just before Mr. Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court on Saturday, polls showed that most voters preferred that the winner of the November election choose the next justice. But now that she has been chosen, the public’s attention turns to the high-stakes confirmation fight. If Judge Barrett were to help overturn Roe v. Wade, as Mr. Trump said on Sunday she “certainly” could, that would go against the will of most Americans, who support keeping abortion legal. In a recent Times/Siena poll, voters said by more than two to one that they would be less likely to back Trump if he appointed a justice who would overturn Roe. The coronavirus pandemic Since May, the pandemic has been a political weak point for Mr. Trump — in part because most Americans have consistently disagreed with his focus on a speedy reopening. By a 15-point margin, respondents to the Times/Siena poll said they disapproved of how he had handled the virus. At the debates, look for Mr. Biden to return to the virus often, hammering the president on what he sees as his greatest vulnerability. The economy If there is one area in which Mr. Trump retains some advantage, it is the economy. By a 12-point margin, respondents to the Times/Siena poll gave him positive marks on that front. But where the economy intersects with the virus, things grow dicier for the president. Fifty-five percent of likely voters said he was at least partly responsible for the economic downturn, according to the Times/Siena poll  — Giovanni Russonello TRANSCRIPT In Judge Amy Coney Barrett we have someone of great character, a great intellect, who has a judicial philosophy that will uphold the Constitution of the United States. President Trump discharged his duty under Article 2 to nominate Judge Barrett to the vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States, and now we look forward, our entire team later, working with you, Republicans in the Senate, and we hope Democrats in the Senate as well, as you discharge your duty to advise and consent. We truly do believe that Judge Barrett represents the best of America personally in terms of her great intellect, her great background. And we have every confidence that as the American people learn more about Judge Amy Coney Barrett, they will be as inspired as President Trump was when he made her nomination. But we believe the Senate has an opportunity, Leader, for a fair and respectful consideration and hearing. We urge our Democratic colleagues in the Senate to take the opportunity to meet with Judge Barrett. And as the hearing goes forward, to provide the kind of respectful hearing that the American people expect. We look forward to a vote in the Senate in the near future and to fill the seat on the Supreme Court of the United States because the American people deserve a justice like Judge Amy Coney Barrett. The American people deserve nine justices on the Supreme Court of the United States. Judge Amy Coney Barrett began meeting Tuesday privately with top Republican senators as Republicans embark on an extraordinarily swift process to try to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before the Nov. 3 election. Three days after President Trump announced Judge Barrett as his choice to sit on the nation’s highest court, she arrived on Capitol Hill with Vice President Mike Pence to begin privately meeting with Republican senators ahead of public hearings next month. The White House then formally nominated her to fill the vacancy left by Justice Ginsburg. Judge Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor and an appeals court judge in Chicago, is expected to remain in the stately Mansfield room for most of Tuesday as senators, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, shuffle in to quiz her privately. “We truly do believe that Judge Barrett represents the best of America personally, in terms of her great intellect, her great background, and we have every confidence that as the American people learn more about Judge Amy Coney Barrett, they will be as inspired as President Trump was when he made her nomination,” Mr. Pence said, ahead of a meeting with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader and a champion of Judge Barrett. Judge Barrett, in a dark blue dress and a single strand of pearls, stood solemnly next to Mr. McConnell, who did not answer a question about whether the judge, if confirmed to the nation’s highest court, should recuse herself from any cases related to the election. Mr. Pence urged Democratic senators to meet with Judge Barrett, though some have already declined the opportunity. Judge Barrett’s confirmation would give conservatives a 6-3 majority on the court, and Democrats have criticized Republicans for moving at an unprecedented clip in an effort to confirm Judge Barrett before the election — especially after Republicans blocked President Barack Obama’s efforts to fill an election-year vacancy on the court four years ago. Multiple polls show that a majority of voters believe whoever wins the general election should have the ability to fill the vacancy left by Justice Ginsburg, who died on Sept. 18. “What I’m looking for and I think what she stands for is the rule of law,” Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who chaired the Judiciary Committee when Judge Barrett was confirmed to the circuit court in 2017.  Mr. Grassley, who reversed himself after previously stating that if her were still chairman he would not hold hearings on a court vacancy just before an election “because that’s what I promised the people in 2016,” said before meeting with Judge Barrett that “I don’t think there’s any doubt about her stellar qualifications.” The White House is expected to formally nominate Judge Barrett on Tuesday, and aides and lawmakers in both parties have already begun combing through Judge Barrett’s background, legal decisions and scholarly work. “It’s the start of a very long process, but went well,”  Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, told reporters. Mr. Meadows, along with Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, were also on Capitol Hill for Judge Barrett’s initial meeting with Mr. McConnell and Mr. Pence. Opposition to her confirmation is also mounting. More than 1,500 alumni at Judge Barrett’s alma mater, Rhodes College, have signed an open letter opposing her nomination. “Many of us also were contemporaries of, friends of, and even sorority sisters of Amy Coney Barrett,” the letter reads. “However, despite the respect that many of us hold for her intellect, and even the friendship that many of us held or continue to hold with her, we are firmly and passionately opposed to her nomination.”  — Emily Cochrane, Luke Broadwater and Hailey Fuchs What’s the best way to get a hint of how President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. might approach their debate tonight? Review their past debates. We reviewed Mr. Trump’s three debates with Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Mr. Biden’s vice-presidential debates, in 2008 and 2012, and a sampling of his Democratic primary debates in 2019 and 2020. Here are some things we found: President Trump is a tough and effective debater. He is unconventional and norm-breaking in many ways (starting with saying things that are false) but quite conventional in others. He had a series of clear messages in 2016: Mrs. Clinton had been in Washington for too long. Democrats supported job-killing trade deals. Obamacare was “a disaster.” He will offer similar assessments about Mr. Biden for viewers tonight. One big difference: Mr. Trump is an incumbent. It’s going to be harder for him to run as the outsider. He presumably will have to defend his record on issues like the pandemic. As Mrs. Clinton learned, with Mr. Trump the hits keep coming; they are often exaggerated or false, and he moves so fast it’s often difficult to keep up with them, much less correct them. Mr. Biden had his ups and downs as a debater. His best performance was his last one, in March. At that point, there were just two people left in the race for the Democratic nomination — Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mr. Biden was aggressive and focused with Mr. Sanders, unlike in some of his earlier performances, pressing him, for example, on his support for Medicare for all.  He deftly turned back attacks with a smile and a laugh.   In the more crowded Democratic debates early on in the campaign, it was easy to tell why so many Democrats — and Mr. Trump — said that Mr. Biden had lost a step. That was not the case with only two people onstage. But there were issues Mr. Biden struggled with, and they are likely to come up tonight, too: His support for NAFTA and for the war in Iraq. — Adam Nagourney It edged out the last episode of “Seinfeld,” but fell short of recent Super Bowls and the “M.A.S.H.” finale. Still, the opening bout in September 2016 between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton notched the biggest audience for a presidential debate since televised debates began in 1960. Roughly 84 million viewers tuned in live, and that was not counting online, mobile and C-SPAN viewers. Network executives are expecting a giant audience for tonight’s meeting between Mr. Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr., in part because it’s the first time the two candidates will meet face-to-face. But a record may not be in the cards. Nielsen ratings, which measure live TV viewers, are likely to dip from four years ago because so many Americans now watch events on the internet or via streaming services. Before 2016, the previous record-holder for a presidential debate was the sole 1980 matchup of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, which drew 80.6 million viewers. Mr. Trump is a proven TV draw: his three meetings with Mrs. Clinton in 2016 had a higher average viewership (74 million) than the debates in 2012 (64 million) and 2008 (57.4 million). In an age where the highest-rated shows on TV barely break the 10-million-viewer mark, presidential debates remain one of the last genuine mass-media events. — Michael M. Grynbaum As voters try to make up their minds on which presidential candidate would be the better steward for the ailing economy, Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s economic proposals show how President Trump has shifted the playing field toward protectionism. In July, Mr. Biden presented an economic strategy to “rebuild domestic manufacturing capacity,” restoring local supply chains from semiconductors to pharmaceuticals. In September he added a tax penalty to the plan, aimed at companies that move jobs to other countries, alongside a tax credit for businesses that bring them home. “There is a common concern, which the Trump candidacy forced a lot of people to think harder about,” said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Mr. Biden who is informally advising his presidential campaign: “the extent to which globalization has left significant swaths of people in many different communities behind.” Mr. Trump has put tariffs on imports from rivals and allies, started a trade war with China and blocked the access of Chinese companies to American technology. But there has been no improvement in Mr. Trump’s preferred indicator of economic dominance, the nation’s trade balance. The balance between America’s exports and imports of goods and services sank in July to its deepest deficit since the administration of George W. Bush. A Biden administration is unlikely to continue to impose tariffs on friends and foes alike, deploying protectionist tools in a more strategic and disciplined way. “Biden is not blindly pro-trade, but he doesn’t want to shrink from the world like President Trump has,” said Ben Harris, a senior economic adviser to Mr. Biden and his campaign. “What the vice president proposes is a new approach to globalization, one in which we don’t get behind every trade deal on the grounds that more trade is always better.” — Eduardo Porter The first debate between President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. takes place Tuesday from 9 to 10:30 p.m. Eastern time. Here are some of the many ways you can watch it: The Times will livestream the debate, and our reporters will provide commentary and analysis. The debate will be televised on channels including PBS, CNN, Fox News, CBS, ABC, C-SPAN, NBC and MSNBC. Many of the same outlets, including ABC, CBS and C-SPAN, will stream the debate on YouTube. Chris Wallace, the anchor of “Fox News Sunday,” will moderate the debate. He played that role in one of the 2016 debates between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton. The moderator chooses the debate topics. For Tuesday night, Mr. Wallace chose Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Biden’s records, the Supreme Court, the coronavirus pandemic, the economy, race and violence in cities and the integrity of the election. There will be 15 minutes to discuss each topic.  Five weeks ahead of Election Day, New York City has been inundated with widespread reports of invalid absentee ballots being sent to voters, with incorrect names and addresses placed across an untold number of mail-back envelopes. So far, the ballot errors appear to be concentrated in Brooklyn, a borough of 2.6 million people whose elections board has a history of mismanaging elections. Michael Ryan, the executive director of the New York City Board of Elections, blamed the problem on the board’s vendor, Phoenix Graphics, a commercial printing company based in Rochester, N.Y., which was hired to mail out ballots in Brooklyn and Queens. “We are determining how many voters have been affected but we can assure that the vendor will address this problem in future mailings, and make sure people who received erroneous envelopes receive new ones,” Mr. Ryan said in a statement on Tuesday. The mislabeled ballots may further undermine confidence in the New York City Board of Elections, which mishandled the state’s primary election in June, and could buttress President Trump’s assertions that absentee voting is plagued with troubles. On Monday, the president retweeted several articles about the problems in the city, including a New York Post report that some voters had received mail-in ballots marked for military use despite never having served in the armed forces. City Board of Elections officials are encouraging voters to call a hotline to receive a new ballot. But phone lines already appear to be jammed: Two voters who called on Monday reported being 65th, and “80-something” in line. Sal DeBiase, the president and chief executive at Phoenix Graphics, did not reply to multiple requests for comment. The company, which was also hired to print and send ballots in June’s primary elections, has worked with the city’s Board of Elections for years. Election officials in New York City have already processed nearly 500,000 absentee ballot applications and began mailing ballots to voters last week. While it remains unclear how many voters have been affected, the printing errors appear to be widespread. — Dana Rubinstein and Luis Ferré-Sadurní John Lewis’s tenure representing Georgia’s Fifth Congressional District spanned 33 years. His successor, at the most, can lay claim to the office for 97 days. Still, seven candidates are running in a special election on Tuesday to serve out the remainder of Mr. Lewis’s term representing a district that covers parts of Atlanta and spreads into the suburbs. Mr. Lewis, a pioneering figure in the civil rights movement who was regarded by colleagues as the “conscience of Congress,” died on July 17 of pancreatic cancer after holding his House seat for 17 terms. The contenders in Tuesday’s election, with a mixed-party ballot, include five Democrats, one independent and a Libertarian. None of the candidates are on the November ballot that will decide who will be sworn into office in January for a full two-year term. The process to replace Mr. Lewis was set in motion within hours of his death, as Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, a Republican, called for a special election and as Democratic Party officials had to rush to find a replacement for the general election in November. The state party quickly opened up applications for possible candidates, drawing 131 submissions over a weekend. Nikema Williams, a state senator, was selected to take Mr. Lewis’s place in a Congressional race that has been one of the most reliable for Democrats. (Mr. Lewis won at least 70 percent of the vote in all but one of his re-election bids.) Ms. Williams, who opted against running in the special election, will face the Republican nominee, Angela Stanton-King, an author and reality-television personality. Ms. Stanton-King had been pardoned by President Trump this year of her conviction for her role in a stolen-car ring. Among those running on Tuesday are Barrington Martin II, a special-education teacher who mounted a failed primary challenge to Mr. Lewis in June, and Robert M. Franklin Jr., a scholar of theology and the former president of Morehouse College in Atlanta who was among the finalists considered for the November ballot. The other candidates are Kwanza Hall, a Democrat and former Atlanta city councilman; Steven Muhammad, a minister and activist running as an independent; Chase Oliver, a Libertarian; Mable Thomas, a Democratic state legislator known as “Able Mable”; and Keisha Sean Waites, a former Democratic state representative. If no single candidate claims a majority of the votes on Tuesday, the top two contenders will advance to a runoff on Dec. 1 to finish out a term that ends on Jan. 3. — Rick Rojas In a stark new warning to voters of color, former President Barack Obama said that President Trump and his supporters were trying to suppress them from participating in the election and urged them to cast their ballots early. Mr. Obama spoke of voter disenfranchisement in a video released by the Biden campaign to PBS, which posted it on its website on Tuesday ahead of the first presidential debate. The minute-long video was targeted at followers of “The Shade Room,” a popular Black news site and social media platform. “Right now, from the White House on down, folks are working to keep people from voting, especially communities of color,” Mr. Obama said. “That’s because there’s a lot at stake in this election, not just our pandemic response or racial justice, but our democracy itself.” Mr. Obama’s comments came a day after Britain’s Channel 4 News reported that the Trump campaign had identified 3.5 million Black voters that it wanted to discourage from voting in 2016 and had used Facebook to target them as part of a “deterrence” scheme. The report cited a cache of information from Cambridge Analytica, the now-defunct political data firm that drew scrutiny for its work for the Trump campaign. A Trump campaign spokesman dismissed the report as “fake news” in a statement to several media outlets on Monday and said that Mr. Trump had forged “a relationship of trust with African-American voters.” Mr. Obama said that Black voters can’t afford to be complacent. “We can’t leave anything to chance,” he said. “Make your plan to vote early. Now is the time to fight for what we believe in.” — Neil Vigdor Interviews with Republican voters in five battleground states in recent days showed that Mr. Trump’s unrelenting campaign to portray the nation’s voting systems as compromised and untrustworthy has intensified the deep misgivings his supporters have about the integrity of the process. While some said they were troubled by the idea that Mr. Trump could refuse to leave if he suffered a decisive defeat, many simply do not believe that he can, or will, lose. And in the event the president does come up short in November, these voters generally agreed that he would be justified in raising questions about whether Democrats had manipulated the outcome rather than accepting disputed results or trusting the state-by-state race calls of news organizations. Alan Knight, a 68-year-old Republican from Sahuarita, Ariz., said Mr. Trump was “going to wait and see whether it was an honest election before handing over power.” Sylvia Rhodes Blakey, 73, of Green Valley, Ariz., was categorical: The only way Mr. Trump will lose is if the Democrats rig the election in favor of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, she said. “There’s going to be massive attempts at fraud,” Ms. Blakey said. “There are so many illegals that have the names of dead people, and they’re voting on those ballots.” Even though there is no evidence of such widespread fraud, the allegation came up repeatedly among Republicans as a reason for Mr. Trump not to commit to handing over power. — Jeremy W. Peters and Hank Stephenson Fox News, which counts President Trump as one of its most voracious viewers, brushed aside the revelations in a report by The New York Times that the billionaire real estate mogul paid little or no federal income taxes for most of the past 20 years. The network’s big three prime-time commentators — Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham — sought to deflect attention on Monday night from Mr. Trump’s tax avoidance to Hunter Biden, the son of Mr. Trump’s opponent. They accused The Times of ignoring the role of Hunter Biden as a paid board member of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of a fired prosecutor general, an arrangement that they called a quid pro quo. Some echoed Mr. Trump’s remarks from the previous day, when the president attacked The Times’s reporting as “fake news” and said the newspaper should have to return the Pulitzer Prizes it had received for its reporting on the Trump family’s finances. “Now the media mob, they’ve been salivating over and tirelessly covering The New York toilet-paper Times and President Trump’s taxes, but they don’t seem to care about the Hunter Biden report on deep state corruption,” Mr. Hannity said on his show, which Mr. Trump has made frequent appearances on as president. The Times, in fact, reported last week that an election-year investigation by Senate Republicans into corruption allegations against Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son found no evidence of improper influence or wrongdoing by the former vice president. Mr. Trump’s allies on Fox News asserted that The Times’s reporting had vindicated the president of having any entanglements with the Russian government that were the focus of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller II. While The Times’s report did not reveal any previously unreported connections to Russia, it was not able to ascertain who Mr. Trump’s lenders were, foreign or domestic. The network’s leading conservative voices also sought to rationalize the millions in tax write-offs by Mr. Trump, saying that he was abiding by a deeply flawed federal tax code that had been amended during Mr. Biden’s two terms as vice president to make it easier for the rich to reduce their tax bills. “What the president did was legal,” Mr. Carlson said. “In fact, it’s all but universal among the affluent who earn their money from investments rather than from salaries. Should the president have used these conventional tax loopholes to his own benefit? We’ll leave that question to professional hyperventilators on the other channels.” Ms. Ingraham called The Times’s piece a “smear job.” “Biden’s resuscitation squad, they think you’re stupid and they had the headline they needed,” she said. — Neil Vigdor and Kathleen Gray President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. will walk onto the presidential debate stage tonight with a very different set of political incentives. Here’s what to watch for.
