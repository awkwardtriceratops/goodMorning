More than 9 million people have voted early in Texas, surpassing the state’s total 2016 turnout. President Trump remakes his election night plans. Biden and Trump will criss-cross the Midwest as the campaign enters its last weekend. Daily schedules: Trump and Biden in Minnesota and Wisconsin, Harris in Texas, Pence in Arizona. As virus cases surge to new records, outbreaks in swing states could shape the election. Donald Trump Jr. said virus deaths had fallen to ‘almost nothing’ as over 1,000 died in the U.S. An appeals court says Minnesota must set aside ballots received after 8 p.m. on Election Day. Brexit Britain looks ready to turn the page on Trump. Texas, a 2020 jump-ball state once considered a layup for Republicans, is shattering turnout records, with the number of early in-person and mail-in ballots now exceeding the total number of votes cast statewide in the 2016 election. Early-voting turnout has been enormous across the country, spurred by the coronavirus pandemic and one of the most bitterly contested presidential races in history, accelerating a years-in-the-making shift away from Election Day-only voting. As of Friday morning, more than 83 million votes had been cast, representing more than 60 percent of the total ballots cast four years ago, according to the nonpartisan U.S. Elections Project. In 11 states, voters have already submitted 80 percent of the ballots cast in those states in 2016, and five of them — Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada, along with Texas — are battlegrounds. Texas, the nation’s second most-populous state, was the second to pass its 2016 threshold. (The first was Hawaii.) The Texas secretary of state’s office reported Friday morning — the last day for early voting in the state — that 9,009,850 people had already voted by mail, dropped ballots in boxes or showed up at polling sites. Four years ago, a record-breaking 8,969,226 Texans voted in the election. The Texas increase has been fueled by huge turnout in urban, Democratic areas, like Harris County, home to Houston, but rural counties that have traditionally voted Republican have also seen significant jumps in voting. Polls show a near dead-heat in the state, with a slight edge for President Trump. Though Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, is making a late swing through the state today, with visits to Houston, McAllen and Fort Worth, the Biden campaign has not put significant time or money into the state, arguing that it is a bad investment: Texas has multiple expensive media markets and is not an essential stop on Mr. Biden’s path to 270 electoral votes. Early-voting patterns, especially in big cities like San Antonio and Austin, suggest that the underlying dynamics of the race are less like 2016, when Mr. Trump won by 9 percentage points, than the 2018 midterms, when Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, narrowly beat Representative Beto O’Rourke, a Democrat. “There’s no doubt that it’s a real race,” Mr. Cruz said recently. The surge in turnout comes despite the fact that Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, a Trump ally, has limited the number of drop boxes to one per county, an order that greatly advantages low-population counties where Republicans predominate. The drop-box limit has been offset by big new investments in election infrastructure in Harris County and elsewhere. Harris County officials opened 10 drive-through voting sites across the county, fighting off an effort by the state Republican Party to shut them down. A separate action by the governor, extending the statewide early voting period by six days, has also contributed to the increases. — Glenn Thrush President Trump has called off plans to appear at the Trump International Hotel on election night and is likely to be at the White House instead, according to a person familiar with the plans. Advisers had said privately that Mr. Trump was going to appear at his namesake hotel in Washington for an election night party for which his campaign had sent out multiple fund-raising solicitations to his supporters. “November 3rd will go down in history as the night we won FOUR MORE YEARS. It will be absolutely EPIC, and the only thing that could make it better is having YOU there,” read one solicitation from the president that included an image of Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, under the words “Join us on election night.” It was unclear why the plans had changed. But the prospect of the president appearing on the night of the election at the hotel was certain to reinforce concerns about Mr. Trump mingling the office with his business. It would also reinforce questions about whether the hotel would be in violation of Washington coronavirus restrictions limiting gatherings to 50 people. And a party would have to be paid for by the campaign, which is facing a cash crunch in the final weeks of the race. A spokesman for Mr. Trump declined to comment. Eric Trump, the president’s son, confirmed Friday morning that the campaign was considering moving the party from the hotel in an interview on “Fox & Friends.” “No, we’re thinking about moving it, actually, over to the White House for — we’re looking at that right now, and it’s going to be a great night,” he said in the interview. “It’s going to be a really, really beautiful night, and I’m really excited.” The last-minute change comes at a time when the president’s opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., has maintained a substantial lead in national polls and a smaller one in several key states. For the last several days, Mr. Trump, who is deeply superstitious, has tried to recreate as many of the 2016 election conditions around himself as possible. Aside from his blunt efforts to raise questions about business dealings by Mr. Biden’s younger son, Hunter, that parallel how he attacked Hillary Clinton in 2016, Mr. Trump has surrounded himself with the people he was with in the final days of that race, such as David Bossie, who then served as the deputy campaign manager, as well as his adviser Hope Hicks and another campaign hand, Jason Miller. Mr. Trump’s approach to politics has always been to treat it as something of a mystical proposition, governed by otherworldly forces in a world in which things generally work out in his favor. The voting results after a campaign in which Mr. Trump has been judged harshly by voters for his performance during the coronavirus pandemic could tell him a very different story. — Maggie Haberman With Election Day less than 100 hours away, the Trump and Biden campaigns are fanning out across the crucial swing states that are likely to decide the race. The president will campaign in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin today, while Joseph R. Biden Jr. travels to Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa. Mr. Biden has already made the remarkably bold pronouncement that he would win Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota, three battleground states that could be his keys to victory. And his decision to add Iowa to his final campaign itinerary — along with Georgia, another state that Mr. Trump won handily in 2016 — is a further sign of confidence. “I am not overconfident about anything,” Mr. Biden said earlier this week. “I just want to make sure we can earn every vote possible.” The Friday events follow a day of dueling campaign appearances in Florida on Thursday, the most elusive prize in Tuesday’s election — and a state that recent polls suggest is effectively tied. The rare convergence of the two men in the same city, Tampa, on the same day was one of the clearest signs yet that both candidates were far from confident of victory in Florida. Though Mr. Biden has gained ground with the older voters who were once solidly part of Mr. Trump’s base, the president is immensely popular with conservative Republicans in Florida and has recently made inroads with Latino voters. On Thursday, he sought to win over independents and moderates with allegations of corruption among Democrats, a line of attack that he has had difficulty making stick against Mr. Biden. The release of data on Thursday showing record-breaking economic growth during the third quarter offered Mr. Trump an opening to tout a rare piece of good news in the campaign’s final stretch. But in Tampa, he spent only about 10 minutes on the economy, and he mocked Republicans who had repeatedly advised him to focus on his economic record instead of lashing out at enemies. “They say, ‘Talk about your economic success. Talk about 33.1 percent, the greatest in history,’ Mr. Trump said in a speech, referring to the G.D.P., hours before Mr. Biden was set to appear at a rally across town. “Now, look, if I do, I mean, how many times can I say it?” Mr. Biden was more disciplined as he continued to hammer the president’s handling of the coronavirus, in a state whose death toll from Covid-19 stands at more than 16,000. He also made a blunt appeal to Latinos, a demographic he has so far struggled to broadly galvanize, by discussing human rights abuses in Cuba and Venezuela. “President Trump can’t advance democracy and human rights for the Cuban people or the Venezuelan people, for that matter, when he has praised so many autocrats around the world,” Mr. Biden said during a speech in Broward County, a Democratic stronghold. The former vice president acknowledged the unique role the state would play in determining the winner. “If we win Florida, it’s game time, it’s over, it’s over,” he said while visiting an outdoor campaign office in Fort Lauderdale. But, as with Mr. Trump, it was unclear whether his message would resonate with enough voters to help ensure a winning coalition. — Katie Glueck, Patricia Mazzei, Mike Ives, Glenn Thrush and Sydney Ember There are four days until Election Day. Here are the schedules of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates for Friday, Oct. 30. All times are Eastern time. President Trump 1 p.m.: Holds a rally in Waterford Township, Mich. 4 p.m.: Holds a rally in Green Bay, Wis. 6:45 p.m.: Holds a rally in Rochester, Minn. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. 1 p.m.: Holds a drive-in rally at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines. 4:45 p.m.: Holds a drive-in rally at the Minnesota State Fairgrounds in St. Paul. 7:30 p.m.: Speaks at Mitchell Airport in Milwaukee.

Evening: Speaks at a rally in Houston. — Glenn Thrush Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former President Barack Obama will make their first public joint appearances of 2020 at rallies in Detroit and Flint, Mich., as the Biden campaign makes a final push for a Blue Wall state that crumbled on Democrats four years ago. Mr. Biden’s campaign announced on Friday that the two men — whose chilly early alliance blossomed into a genuine friendship over eight years in the White House — “will travel to Michigan to discuss bringing Americans together to address the crises facing the country and winning the battle for the soul of the nation.” The campaign, in keeping with its tight-lipped approach to major events, did not release specific times or locations for the appearances. Both will be “drive-in” rallies in which supporters gather in parking lots at pandemic-appropriate social distances, with an afternoon rally in Flint followed by an evening event in Detroit. Their objective in a state President Trump carried by just 10,704 votes in 2016 was far less of a mystery: Hillary Clinton’s loss was the result, in part, of lackluster turnout among Black voters in Detroit and Flint. Mr. Trump has also spent much of his recent time in the state. He is scheduled to hold a rally this afternoon in Oakland County, a moderate suburban bellwether that has been slipping away from Republicans. Mr. Biden has held a steady lead in the state for months, but his campaign has warned against the kind of overconfidence that prompted Mrs. Clinton to scale back campaigning in the Upper Midwest four years ago. — Glenn Thrush Voters in several swing states are casting their ballots even as the coronavirus reaches new peaks in their communities, creating more uncertainty about how they will vote — and for whom. The pandemic has killed nearly 230,000 people in the United States and upended the nation’s economy. In recent days, 24 states have broken one-week records for virus cases. On Thursday, the country recorded at least 90,000 new cases for the first time and crossed the threshold of nine million cases — the highest national total in the world, although some countries have had more cases in proportion to their populations. Now the virus could help decide the presidential election. Some electoral battlegrounds, like Michigan and North Carolina, are seeing record numbers of cases and deaths. Hospitals in Wisconsin and other hard-hit areas are reaching capacity, pushing health care providers to the brink and leaving their workers reeling. “Things are really running rampant, so there is a lot of discontent,” said Barry Burden, the director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Wisconsin, which announced 255 coronavirus deaths over the past week and where nearly 1 in 25 people has tested positive for the virus, narrowly voted for President Trump in 2016. But the virus may change the outlook for him there. “I do think it provides more of a challenge for Trump to try and win the state, because any news about the pandemic — it’s not good for him,” Dr. Burden said. The pandemic has also already complicated the voting process itself. Because of concerns that the virus will hamper people’s ability to vote, several states have encouraged mail-in voting. About 1.64 million people had returned absentee ballots in Wisconsin as of Thursday, more than half of the total ballots cast in 2016. In other battleground states like North Carolina, Florida and — this year — Texas, the president could see fading support from Republicans frustrated by what they see as a lackluster federal response to the coronavirus. Those states may also see higher turnout among Democrats who voted by mail for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “Enthusiasm for turning out for Trump among Trump supporters will wane somewhat, and so it will affect turnout somewhat,” said John Aldrich, a professor of political science at Duke University. In dueling campaign appearances in Tampa, Fla., on Thursday, the candidates launched scathing attacks at each other over the virus. Mr. Trump continued to play down the pandemic, telling a mostly maskless crowd that Mr. Biden would bring the economy to a grinding halt, while Mr. Biden called the Trump rally a “super-spreader event.” On Friday, the Trump campaign will have to limit the size of a rally in Minnesota to 250 people because of statewide rules designed to limit the spread of infection. The campaign bristled at the restrictions, calling them “free speech-stifling dictates.” — Will Wright and Mitch Smith Donald Trump Jr., echoing his father’s inaccurate claim that the country is turning the corner in fighting the pandemic, said on Thursday night that deaths had dropped to “almost nothing,” as the nation reported 1,004 deaths from the coronavirus in one day during a record-breaking surge in cases. “I went through the C.D.C. data, because I kept hearing about new infections, but I was like, ‘Well, why aren’t they talking about this?’ ” Mr. Trump said in an interview with the Fox News host Laura Ingraham, a longtime Trump ally. “Oh, because the number is almost nothing. Because we’ve gotten control of this thing, we understand how it works. They have the therapeutics to be able to deal with this.” As Ms. Ingraham shook her head in agreement, he repeated: “It’s gone to almost nothing.” While some treatments, including the kinds of therapeutics and steroids used on his father, have improved the likelihood of survival for those who are able to obtain them, Mr. Trump’s claims were deeply misleading and perpetuate a dismissive view of the virus widely condemned in the public health community. Mr. Trump called critics of his father’s coronavirus response “truly morons.” The elder Trump echoed his son on Twitter Friday morning, writing that deaths from the virus are “WAY DOWN.” They aren’t. Over the past two weeks, daily fatalities have increased 16 percent nationwide. They just broke 1,000 two days in a row, for the first time in nearly two months. Deaths reached their peak in early April, when more than 2,000 people in the United States were dying of the virus each day, but after falling to about 500 per day in July, deaths climbed back up as states lifted restrictions. In the past two weeks, more than 12,000 people have died of the virus in the United States, sending the official death count, which many health experts say is well below the true toll, past 228,000. At a rally in Tampa, Fla., President Trump said once again that the country was “turning the corner” on the virus and repeated his misleading claim that a vaccine would be widely distributed in a matter of weeks. In fact, nine states set new one-day case records on Thursday, as did the nation, recording more than 90,000 cases for the first time.   — Glenn Thrush The Republican Georgia Senator David Perdue withdrew on Thursday from the final debate in his tight re-election race a day after his Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff, called him a “crook” and accused him of trying to profit from the coronavirus. The rivals had been scheduled to face off on Sunday, the third debate in one of two pivotal Senate races in Georgia that could determine which party controls the chamber. The candidates had committed to the debate in September, according to Mr. Ossoff’s campaign. Mr. Ossoff broke the news that Mr. Perdue had canceled on him on Twitter: “At last night’s debate, millions saw that Perdue had no answers when I called him out on his record of blatant corruption, widespread disease, and economic devastation,” he wrote. “Shame on you, Senator.” A spokesman for Mr. Perdue confirmed that he would not be at the debate and said in a statement that the senator had better uses of his time. “As lovely as another debate listening to Jon Ossoff lie to the people of Georgia sounds, Senator Perdue will not be participating in the WSB-TV debate but will instead join the 45th president, Donald J. Trump, for a huge get-out-the-vote rally in Northwest Georgia,” the spokesman, John Burke, said. Mr. Ossoff’s stinging comments about Mr. Perdue’s conduct came during a bruising debate that underscored the bitter partisan divide in what was once a safely Republican state. Mr. Perdue, a wealthy former corporate executive, bought stock in DuPont de Nemours, which sells personal protective equipment, on Jan. 24, the same day he received a classified briefing on the threat posed by the coronavirus, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. “It’s not just that you’re a crook, Senator,” Mr. Ossoff said, turning to face his socially-distanced opponent as Mr. Perdue’s eyes remained fixed on the camera. “It’s that you’re attacking the health of the people that you represent. You did say Covid-19 was no deadlier than the flu. You did say there would be no significant uptick in cases. All the while you were looking after your own assets and your own portfolio.” Mr. Perdue, 70, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and said any transactions he made were executed by a financial adviser without his knowledge. “The thing I’m most upset about,” Mr. Perdue said of Mr. Ossoff, “is that he’ll say and do anything to my friends in Georgia to mislead them about how radical and socialist” his agenda is. Recent polls have found Mr. Perdue and Mr. Ossoff, 33, in a dead heat. If neither candidate hits 50 percent of the vote, they will compete in a runoff election in January. Georgia’s other Senate race is also close, though the Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat and pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, has led in recent polls. He faces Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican who was appointed to her seat; Representative Doug Collins, another Republican; and several other candidates. That race will almost certainly result in a runoff. — Glenn Thrush and Neil Vigdor A federal appeals court ruled on Thursday that Minnesota election officials must set aside any ballots that arrive after 8 p.m. on election night, throwing into uncertainty the seven-day grace period that had been in place for ballots postmarked by Election Day. The fate of the segregated ballots remains up in the air. Another court ruling could come down instructing officials whether or not to accept them. The divided state legislature, where Republicans control the Senate and Democrats control the House, could rush through a law regarding the ballots, though that is unlikely. The ruling, issued just five days before the election, comes as an estimated 578,000 absentee ballots that had been requested in the state have not been returned,  according to the U.S. Elections Project. Many of those ballots could already be in the mail, or voters can still return ballots in person. It also comes as President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. plan to hold rallies in the state today. Mr. Biden has held a steady polling lead in Minnesota for most of the campaign. In its 2-to-1 ruling, the court said that the Minnesota secretary of state had “extended the deadline for receipt of ballots without legislative authorization.” “The consequences of this order are not lost on us,” the court majority wrote. “We acknowledge and understand the concerns over voter confusion, election administration issues, and public confidence in the election.” But, the court said, “we conclude the challenges that will stem from this ruling are preferable to a postelection scenario where mail-in votes, received after the statutory deadline, are either intermingled with ballots received on time or invalidated without prior warning. Better to put those voters on notice now while they still have at least some time to adjust their plans and cast their votes in an unquestionably lawful way.” Judge Jane L. Kelly, in a dissenting opinion, said that the decision “will cause voter confusion and undermine Minnesotans’ confidence in the election process.” She said it also risked disenfranchising voters in Minnesota. Elections officials in the state have been instructing voters who had not mailed their ballots by Tuesday to return them by drop box or to vote in person. But the decision still puts the fate of an unknown number of ballots at risk. The court instructed elections officials to segregate and maintain all ballots that arrive after the 8 p.m. deadline. Democrats in Minnesota denounced the decision. “In the middle of a pandemic, the Republican Party is doing everything to make it hard for you to vote,” Senator Amy Klobuchar, the senior senator from Minnesota and a Democrat, said on Twitter. “Stand up for YOUR rights: Vote in-person or take mail-in ballot directly to ballot box.” About 50 million Americans have already voted by mail. Here’s what processing those ballots looks like in a crucial swing state. — Nick Corasaniti When President Trump called the pro-Brexit politician Nigel Farage to the stage during his rally in Goodyear, Ariz., on Wednesday, it was a reminder that Britain’s bombshell vote to leave the European Union in June 2016 was seen as a harbinger of Mr. Trump’s victory in the United States that fall. And yet, four years later, Britain has moved on from Brexit, and Mr. Farage is widely viewed there as yesterday’s man, forced to travel abroad to seek a spotlight that has swung away from him at home. Despite Mr. Trump’s staunch support of Brexit and his effusive displays of affection for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Britain seems equally ready to turn the page on the president. “There are millions and millions of Brits who voted for Brexit and think Donald Trump is ghastly and something quite different,” said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European studies at Oxford University. Inside Mr. Johnson’s government, where the prospect of a Trump defeat has been a source of anxiety for months, officials now talk about how they could adjust to a President Joe Biden. In foreign policy, diplomats spin visions of Britain standing alongside the United States in a coalition of democracies against the commercial and geopolitical pressure of autocrats in China and Russia. That is a role Mr. Johnson could never comfortably play with a president who relishes the company of strongmen. And on one of Mr. Johnson’s top priorities, an Anglo-American trade deal, officials say they could “Bidenize” whatever they have negotiated with Mr. Trump to make it palatable to a Democratic administration, though American analysts are skeptical. “It’s a little tone-deaf to say, ‘We have this deal with Trump. What icing do you want on the cake to make it a Biden deal?’” said Thomas Wright, the director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution in Washington. — Mark Landler With recent electoral history and current polls suggesting that Democrats are likely to make gains in vote-rich suburbs across the country, President Trump’s path to re-election has always required him to expand his support in rural and exurban counties in Pennsylvania, as well as in Midwestern states where he squeezed out slight victories in 2016. He seems to be doing that so far during early voting in Pennsylvania: Around 24 percent of the 392,000 registered Republicans who have cast early mail-in votes in the state did not vote four years ago, according to TargetSmart, a Democratic elections data firm. But before the Trump campaign takes a victory lap, the same data analysis shows that in Pennsylvania — where at least 1.8 million voters had returned ballots as of Wednesday — Democrats are keeping pace. About one in four of the 1.2 million registered Democrats who have voted did not vote in 2016. Both parties are succeeding in one of their chief goals this year: to motivate large numbers of infrequent voters or nonvoters to come off the sidelines for what supporters of both nominees call the most crucial election of a lifetime. It was a goal that eluded Senator Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary, but with Democrats united, Joseph R. Biden Jr. is pulling it off. And Mr. Trump is answering critics who said his appeal was limited to those in his base who voted for him four years ago. The trends playing out in Pennsylvania are seen across 14 battleground states, where more than 9.3 million people who didn’t vote in 2016 have already cast ballots this year, making up 25 percent of the early vote in those states. “The fact that one in four didn’t vote in 2016 suggests there’s a whole lot of these turnout targets who didn’t come out before, who have been motivated to come out,” said Tom Bonier, the chief executive of TargetSmart. So far, the data shows that more Democratic-leaning voters who didn’t cast ballots in 2016 are turning out than Republican-leaning voters. “Nationally, Democrats have a modeled advantage of 14.5 percent with those non-2016 voters,” Mr. Bonier said. But that is partly because Mr. Trump has made mail-in ballots toxic to many of his supporters through his frequent (and unfounded) claims that mail voting is rife with fraud. Trump supporters are expected to dominate in-person voting on Election Day in some battleground states. — Trip Gabriel The acting chairman of the county board that inspects and tabulates mail-in ballots in Jacksonville, Fla., resigned on Thursday amid criticism that he had made political donations to President Trump and displayed his campaign signs at his home. The resignation of Brent D. Shore, a Duval County judge who is a Republican, was confirmed by the county’s supervisor of elections, Mike Hogan. Judge Shore was one of the alternates on the three-person canvassing board and had been filling in as its chairman. The panel has come under intense scrutiny in this year of record numbers of mail-in ballots, and Judge Shore has faced criticism for restricting photography and video recordings of the board’s counting and checking signatures on mail-in ballots. It was not the first time that the panel, or Judge Shore, was in the glare of publicity. The judge was the board’s chairman during the 2000 race between George W. Bush and Al Gore, when many Black voters in the county complained that their ballots had not been counted. Duval County, home to nearly a million people and Florida’s largest city, could play a significant role in deciding who wins the state, and ultimately the presidential election. Mr. Trump won the county by under 6,000 votes in 2016. Judge Shore had made at least six small contributions to Mr. Trump’s campaign this year totaling less than $200, federal campaign finance records show. This year, he has also contributed nine times to WinRed, a fund-raising platform created by the Republican National Committee, for a total of less than $200. His resignation was first reported by The Florida Times-Union, which published photos of Trump campaign signs and stickers in the judge’s yard. Under Florida’s Code of Judicial Conduct, judges are barred from contributing to candidates or political organizations. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
