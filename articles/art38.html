A South Korean pastor whose church is at the center of a new outbreak has tested positive. RIGHT NOW The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill announced it would shift to remote learning for all undergraduate classes starting Wednesday, a move that came after the university said it had seen a number of cases emerge.  As teachers and students look ahead to the start of the school year, officials around the world continued this week to roll out and refine strategies to address the challenges and fears brought on by the pandemic. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill announced it would shift to remote learning for all undergraduate classes starting Wednesday. The university, with 30,000 students, was one of the largest in the country to open its campus during the pandemic. Officials said 177 students had been isolated after testing as of Monday, and another 349 students were in quarantine because of possible exposure. “We have not taken this decision lightly,” the school’s chancellor, Kevin M. Guskiewicz, and provost, Robert A. Blouin, wrote in an email announcing the change, which they said was made after consultation with local and state health experts. The university said it would help students leave campus housing without financial penalty. It was not immediately clear how the university’s decision would affect its athletic programs, though North Carolina said that student-athletes could remain in their dormitories. The university’s athletic department said in a statement that it still expected its students would be able to play fall sports, but that it would “continue to evaluate the situation.” The school is a member of the elite Atlantic Coast Conference, which has scheduled its football season to open in September. But the juxtaposition of playing sports while the campus is broadly closed to ordinary academic life — U.N.C. is scheduled to host a game in Chapel Hill on Sept. 12 — could prove complicated. In July, county health officials had urged the university to consider virtual classes for at least the first five weeks of the fall semester. And earlier this month, dozens of students protested plans to reopen by staging a “die-in” on campus. A similar protest erupted on Monday at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, the first day of fall classes. The school had said that majority of courses would have some in-person attendance this fall, but dozens of students and faculty members staged a “die-in” on campus to push for more options for staff and students to teach or learn remotely. Brett Tregoning, a graduate student in the School of Physics who helped organize the demonstrators, said they had staged a die-in “to symbolize the death that is going to happen because of the administration’s reckless policies that prioritize the bottom line over our lives.” Some of the concerns about reopening college campuses have been directed at students who have gathered at bars or house parties. Video footage appearing to show University of North Georgia students attending a crowded off-campus party garnered online attention over the weekend. A spokesperson at the Dahlonega, Ga., school said that officials were “disappointed” that mostly-maskless students at the party failed to heed social distancing guidelines. At the primary and secondary level, students across much of Arizona started school on Monday. But classes in the J.O. Combs Unified School District were canceled after a significant number of teachers and staff members called in sick, and it was unclear when and how the school year might start there. Schools in the district, about an hour outside of Phoenix, had planned to open in a hybrid model, with a mix of virtual and in-person instruction. The local teachers’ association wants the district to stick with virtual instruction until it can meet Arizona’s benchmarks for reopening schools. Despite a steady decrease in statewide cases over the last few weeks, none of the state’s districts have met those metrics yet. But many have decided to open anyway. In Los Angeles, public schools on Monday began a sweeping program to test hundreds of thousands of students and teachers even though, for the time being, the Los Angeles Unified School District will begin school online. The testing plan, which will be rolled out over the next few months, will seek to administer tests to nearly 700,000 students and 75,000 employees as the district, the nation’s second-largest, awaits permission from public health authorities to resume in-person instruction, said Austin Beutner, the district’s superintendent. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has been hoping to reopen the nation’s largest school system on a part-time basis for the city’s 1.1 million schoolchildren this fall — a feat no other big-city mayor is currently even attempting. But Mr. de Blasio is facing mounting pressure from the city’s teachers, principals and even members of his own administration to delay the start of in-person instruction by at least a few weeks to give educators more time to prepare. About 50 school leaders signed a letter that called for a delay to in-person instruction until the end of September and included a detailed plan for how to phase children into schools over the course of the fall, starting with young children. Doctors on the front lines of the pandemic say they are fighting not just the coronavirus, but also a never-ending scourge of misinformation about the disease that is hurting patients. Some say they regularly treat people more inclined to believe what they read on social media than what a medical professional tells them. Before the pandemic, medical professionals had grown accustomed to dealing with patients misled by online information, a phenomenon they called Dr. Google. But in interviews, more than a dozen doctors and misinformation researchers in the United States and Europe said the volume related to the virus was like nothing they had seen before. According to the doctors and researchers, several factors are to blame: leaders like President Trump who amplify fringe theories; social media platforms that are not doing enough to stamp out false information; and individuals who are too quick to believe what they see online. For example, approximately 800 people worldwide died in the first three months of the year — and thousands more were hospitalized — after following unfounded claims online that advised ingesting highly concentrated alcohol to kill the virus, researchers concluded in a report published last week in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. The American Medical Association and other groups representing doctors say the false information spreading online is harming the public health response to the disease. The World Health Organization is developing methods to measure the harm of virus-related misinformation online, and over two weeks in July the group hosted an online conference with doctors, public health experts and internet researchers about how to address the problem. The falsehoods, doctors say, have undermined efforts to get people to wear masks and fueled a belief that the seriousness of the disease is overblown. At some hospitals, people have arrived asking for a doctor’s note so they do not have to wear a mask at work because they believe another online rumor — that it will harm their oxygen levels. And a growing fear is that vaccine conspiracy theories could undermine eventual vaccination efforts critical for returning to pre-pandemic routines. Online platforms like YouTube, which is owned by Google, and Facebook have introduced policies to limit coronavirus misinformation and elevate material from trusted sources. This month, Facebook and Twitter removed a post by Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign that falsely claimed that children do not get the virus. But untrue information continues to spread. Last month, a video from a group of people calling themselves America’s Frontline Doctors conveyed inaccurate claims about the virus, including that hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug, is an effective coronavirus treatment and that masks do not slow the spread of the virus. The video was viewed millions of times. U.S. ROUNDUP Louis DeJoy, the postmaster general, has agreed to testify before a key House panel next week, as Democrats step up their scrutiny of sweeping changes at the United States Postal Service. Mr. DeJoy will voluntarily appear before the House Oversight Committee next Monday as part of the panel’s continuing investigation into whether the cost-cutting changes he has championed at the agency could impair the rights of voters to cast their ballots by mail in the November election. Earlier in the day, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, pushed back on concerns that the agency would not be able to handle as many as 80 million ballots cast by Americans by mail in the November election. He told reporters in his home state on Monday that “the Postal Service is going to be just fine.” “We’re going to make sure that the ability to function going into the election is not adversely affected,” Mr. McConnell said at a news conference in Horse Cave, Ky. Mr. McConnell’s comments come a day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of California, called the House back from its annual summer recess nearly a month early so that the chamber could vote on legislation to block changes at the Postal Service. House Democrats are preparing for a Saturday vote on legislation to reverse cost-cutting measures at the Postal Service and pump $25 billion in emergency funding into the ailing agency. Mr. Trump has repeatedly derided voting by mail as vulnerable to fraud, without evidence, and the issue had become a prominent sticking point in negotiations over the next round of virus relief. Mail-in voters from California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, New Jersey, Wisconsin and New York filed a lawsuit Monday against Mr. Trump and Mr. DeJoy seeking to block cuts to the Postal Service ahead of the November election. The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, asks the court to declare that Mr. Trump and Mr. DeJoy have violated voters’ rights by cutting the Postal Service in an effort to stymie mail-in voting. Across the country, election officials are rethinking vote-by-mail strategies, with some states seeking to bypass the Postal Service with ballot drop boxes, drive-through drop-offs or expanded in-person voting options. In other developments around the United States: With the pandemic still raging, the Democratic National Convention, which begins on Monday, will be conducted almost entirely online. Wisconsin is averaging about 770 new cases per day, more than twice as many daily cases as at the start of summer, but also far fewer than the state’s late-July peak of more than 950 cases per day. Michelle Obama, the former first lady, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the runner-up in the Democratic primary, will headline the first night. Here’s how to watch. TRANSCRIPT “I accept —” “— your nomination —” “— for president —” “— of the United States.” [cheers and applause] The conventions. “It’s when a lot of people start taking the race seriously.” “I’ve been to pretty much every convention since 1988.” “Read my lips.” “Normally, a convention is wild.” But in 2020, things are a little different. “The pandemic has changed virtually every aspect of the 2020 campaign.” “I think it’s defining the election. And I think you’re seeing that in the way they’re approaching the conventions.” “You could say that it has caused a reckoning about, do political conventions even matter at all? Can’t we just do this whole process without them?” So, how did the conventions grow to the spectacles they are today? “What do you mean, ‘shut up’?” And what will this year hold? “Conventions have been around for about a century in various forms.” “1944: The Democratic Convention in Chicago, Illinois, lifted the roof.” “I mean, it used to be, like, you’d have these really dramatic nomination fights.” “I feel absolutely confident that, in this convention, I’m going to be the winner.” “And floor fights.” “I don’t care!” “Keep your hands off of me!” “And things about platform and who should be allowed. The networks used to give these things around-the-clock attention, gavel to gavel. And most of that stuff is gone.” Over time, the process evolved. And now candidates are chosen based on the results of primaries and caucuses, so there aren’t many surprises. “And what has happened to the conventions is they have become this sort of four-night advertisement for the candidates —” “Thank you.” “— and their parties.” “If you believe that we must be fierce and relentless and terminate terrorism, then you are a Republican.” [cheers] But generally, that format hasn’t really changed. “The critique of conventions is that they’re just kind of like a dinosaur.” [music, Los Del Rio, “Macarena”] “They’re a relic of a past age of politics.” The challenge for campaigns this year — “Good afternoon, everybody.” — is how to pack in substance and excitement virtually. “How do you do a convention in the midst of a pandemic?” “The campaigns have really struggled to carry on since the pandemic.” “Good morning.” “Joe Biden is a helpless puppet —” “In contrast to Trump’s desire to keep campaigning, Biden has been at home, for the most part.” “The Democratic Party has approached the convention and Covid —” “Hey, good evening, Tampa.” “— much more conservatively, small C, than the Republican Party.” “We saved millions of lives. And now, it’s time to open up, get back to work, OK?” So what is actually going to happen? Well, the plan has changed — a lot. “The Democrats had hoped to have a big, splashy convention in Milwaukee. Then the virus intervened.” So the Democrats went to an almost entirely virtual convention. “And we ultimately received the call that even Joe Biden would not actually be traveling to Milwaukee to give his speech in person.” Instead, now all speakers, including Biden, will deliver their addresses from around the country. And the R.N.C.? “The Republicans had hoped to hold the convention in Charlotte, North Carolina.” But after North Carolina required masks and social distancing rules, the R.N.C. moved the main events to Jacksonville. Then cases spiked in Florida. “I looked at my team, and I said, ‘The timing for this event is not right.’” So now, they’ll be mostly virtual as well. And Trump will give his speech accepting the party nomination from Washington, D.C. “The challenge for both of these conventions is, what can you do to engage the American electorate that is already very tired of sitting on Zooms all day? What can you do to ensure that they tune in anyway and get energized?” “— is Jimmy Carter and I’m running for president.” “In terms of presenting the candidate to the nation, there are two moments to watch. One’s the roll call.” “We’re now prepared to call the roll of the state.” “Roll call vote!” This is where the delegates formally nominate the candidate. “California casts 33-and- one-half votes for Kennedy.” “And it’s kind of corny, but it’s kind of cool. But it’s kind of corny.” “75 votes for President George W. Bush!” “This year, I guess, it’ll be a Zoom call. And the other is the speech.” “Extremism in the defense of liberty —” “Let us build a peace.” “Let me be the bridge to an America that only the unknowing call myth.” “This is the biggest audience they will have for their pitch to Americans.” “The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation —” “This is their chance to lay out their vision for the future of the country.” “— I alone can fix it.” This year, Biden and Trump will give these speeches to, well, primarily a TV camera. “Giving a speech without an audience and without having a constant loop of audience feedback does look poised to present a challenge for both of the presidential contenders.” So are there any potential benefits to this? “One of the sort of benefits of the pandemic is that people in, well, a lot of the country are still locked at home. The question is, Are you going to watch reruns of ‘The Sopranos,’ or are you going to watch the convention?” “I think there’s a lot of fear and a lot of interest. And people really want to know how these different leaders are going to lead us through this pandemic and through the economic crisis that accompanied it.” But there’s also potentially a whole lot of downside. “You lose the energy that, presumably, you send delegates out into the world with to begin the fall campaign.” “For the president, what he’s missing out on is showing off this contrast from four years ago, when there was a lot of dissent against him.” “Stand and speak and vote your conscience.” “He would be able to show that, four years later, the party is in lockstep with him.” “They don’t call it Super Tuesday for nothing!” “Joe Biden is missing these big moments that would show someone who has struggled to look like a real candidate with a lot of enthusiasm behind him.” “Just this morning we heard we won Maine as well.” “Yeah, right!” So is it time to rethink conventions altogether? “I think the conventions matter less this year than ever — partly because neither one of them is happening in a normal way, but also because this election seems more than anything to be a referendum about Donald Trump. It’s really Donald Trump against Donald Trump.” “You’re fired! Get out!” “We’re just getting started.” And don’t expect the rest of the campaign to resume any sort of normalcy soon. “Historically, the conventions do mark the beginning of a really intense general election campaign cycle. But the subsequent activities after the convention — door-to-door engaging of those voters, how those voters actually cast their ballots — all of that is set to look extraordinarily different this year.” “So, we are in my tiny, postage stamp-sized backyard in Washington.” “We’re in my backyard in Hollywood, California.” “And I am currently at home in New York City, about to head to Delaware.” “It’s very hot. It’s very buggy. But we’re making the best of it.” “Hi. I’m Sarah Kerr, the producer of this video. We spent weeks looking back through footage of old conventions and learning how they might be different this year. Now, they’re finally here. And they’re definitely going to be unconventional. Check out nytimes.com every night for live video and analysis. We’ll see you there.” Under emergency coronavirus orders, the Trump administration is using hotels across the country to hold migrant children and families, creating a largely unregulated shadow system of detention and swift expulsions. Mayor Carlos Gimenez of Miami-Dade County, Fla., said Monday that he has been holding near-weekly phone meetings with Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami and Drs. Jerome Adams, Deborah L. Birx and Anthony S. Fauci. The federal experts have taken a special interest in the stubborn virus spread in the region. Though the county’s positivity rate has dropped, Mr. Gimenez said the county’s rate needs to continue to fall to under 10 percent before more businesses can reopen. Over the weekend, 21 people in San Mateo, Calif., were charged with filing fraudulent pandemic unemployment assistance claims while in jail. The claims resulted in total payments of more than $250,000, according to the authorities. The felony charges they face — various counts of conspiracy to commit fraud — each carry a maximum penalty of thee years in prison. Fearing a “twindemic” that combines a resurgence of the coronavirus and a severe flu season, health officials are encouraging people to get flu shots. TRANSCRIPT From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: To end the pandemic in the U.S., the White House is trying to defy the timelines that have governed the development of a vaccine for decades. Is it working? My colleague, Katie Thomas, on Operation Warp Speed. It’s Monday, August 17. So, Katie, when does the hunt for a coronavirus vaccine begin in the United States? Well, the vaccine companies started working on something back in January when the genetic sequence for the virus was first published. But it wasn’t until later in February, as it was spreading around the world and as cases were growing in the United States, that the broader conversation about when can we have a vaccine really began. Well, thank you very much. Today we are meeting with the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, the biggest in the world — So then an early March — — to discuss how the federal government can accelerate the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatments for the coronavirus. President Trump met with several executives from drug companies, big vaccine manufacturers — When do you think you could have the vaccine? When do you think you’d be able to have it — start producing it? We’re producing it now, an experimental lot. And so these executives told him that they were moving on it at a really accelerated timetable. So we’re hoping to get the phase one stuff very soon now. And then it’s going to be a few months to get the human data that would allow us to pick a corrective dose to start a phase two [INAUDIBLE]. But even with that timetable, it would take a couple of months to get into clinical trials. And how long would that take? Phase two would take a few months before then going to phase three. All right, so you’re talking within a year. Like I’ve been telling you, a year to a year in a half. But Lenny is talking about two months. And then it could be a year to a year and a half before we would have a vaccine. Hm, and by my count, a year to a year and a half from then would mean we would have a vaccine maybe next summer. Right, at some point in 2021. I mean, I like the sound of a couple of months better. And it was clear that President Trump wanted to see it move more quickly. We have to be very careful here if you vaccinate several hundred million — You got to make sure it works. Works and safe. Doesn’t hurt you — right. I agree, I agree. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great company, thank you. It’s worth noting that that year to a year-and-a-half timeline is already extremely fast. The current record for developing a vaccine is actually four years for the mumps vaccine. And, Katie, can you walk me through why exactly it takes so long? Well, it’s a huge process. I mean, first it starts out in the lab. And you have scientists who are basically testing out different candidates for a vaccine. And that in and of itself can take years. Right. And if they do get lucky and they do come out with something that could work, then they need to start testing it on animals. And we see if they survive and if there’s any big problems. That can take months. If it passes that test, then we start human clinical trials. So there’s three phases of that. There’s phase one, which is the early safety trial. And that can take months. And then they have to evaluate the data. And then only if they feel like it’s safe can they move on to the next phase, which is phase two — you know, with a larger group of people to test mainly safety. And they have to analyze those results again. Which I’m guessing could take months. That’s right. And then, only then, do they start the biggest, riskiest phase, which is phase three, the large-scale trials to really test out whether a vaccine works. And in order to do this, they have to test it out in tens of thousands of people. And then they wait months, sometimes years. Wow. And so if a vaccine makes it through all of these phases and goes through lengthy analysis of the results to make sure that they didn’t miss anything, then they submit their application to the Food and Drug Administration, which itself goes through a very long review process. And then the agency decides whether it will get approved. So you’re looking at a process that can really take a decade. I mean, just listening to you, this is an exhausting process. You have to follow each and every one of these steps in order, no matter how long it takes. That’s right. And one thing that stops a lot of companies from bringing their products to the finish line is something that people call “the valley of death.” Hm, what’s that? So the valley of death is the period between when a company has figured out a good candidate for a vaccine or even a drug, and then they have to put it through clinical trials. And clinical trials — Those three phases you just described? Yeah, three phases. And those trials — they’re expensive, they’re risky, they take a lot of coordination with hospitals and doctors around the world. And if you fail at any step in the process, you kind of had to go back to the drawing board. So that’s a lot of times where products that were very promising basically die. And none of this timeline that you’re describing would seem ideal for developing a vaccine in the middle of an urgent deadly pandemic? No. So after that March meeting when Trump was pushing for the companies to go even faster than what would have already been a record timeline, a top regulator at the F.D.A. was also thinking about how to make this process go faster. And what emerges becomes known as Operation Warp Speed. Warp drive, Mr. Scott. Accelerating to warp one, sir. Which is a reference to “Star Trek,” because the regulator was a fan of the show. Right, because as everyone who is at least 40 years old knows, the ship at the center of Star Trek travels at warp speed. Yeah, that’s right. I was really skeptical when Operation Warp Speed first came out, because I thought it was Trump just repackaging stuff that was already being done. What do you mean? Well, there’s already a unit within the Department of Health and Human Services whose whole job is to give money to companies that are developing vaccines or other treatments and to help them get through that valley of death. But what Operation Warp Speed did was they took that idea and they just ran with it. The idea was to get more companies involved at a much bigger scale. So Congress at that point had appropriated almost $10 billion in funding for both vaccines and for treatments. And the hope was that that would allow the companies to shift their resources to these clinical trials and to data analysis and development. That they would give them a lot of cash and that could basically speed up the whole process. But what was really new under the Operation Warp Speed plan was how they were approaching manufacturing. Because normally, a drug company isn’t going to start mass producing their vaccine until they know that their vaccine works, until it’s gone through all of these clinical trials and they have a pretty good idea that it’s actually going to come onto the market. And so the federal government had the idea to pay these companies a lot of money to start making millions of doses of their vaccine before they even knew that it would work. But if one of them does, then you know, as soon as we know that it’s safe and effective we will have millions of doses that are ready to go. But of course, on the flip side of that is the reality that the government will be paying companies to make millions of doses of vaccines that will very likely — many of them — never get used and probably have to get tossed into the garbage. Yeah, so they’re basically taking on a financial risk that the companies would never want to do on their own. And the final piece of Operation Warp Speed is they brought in the military. Operation Warp Speed is actually being led by two agencies, the Department of Health and Human Services, which is overseeing the science and the development of the vaccines, and then the Department of Defense, which has a lot of experience in logistics. And the thought here was that the military can supply a vast amount of materials quickly to different locations, whether that’s for clinical trials or for manufacturing, or ultimately, to distribute it to millions of Americans. So, Katie, just to summarize this, under Operation Warp Speed, the government is incentivizing companies to try to make vaccines by giving them billions of dollars. On top of that, it is paying for these companies to manufacture those vaccines even before we know whether they’re safe and effective so that they will be ready at a moment’s notice. And finally, behind the scenes and surrounding all of this, the United States military is basically on call to keep this process moving. Yeah, that’s right. OK, so how does it all go? I mean, what happens once all this stuff is in place and Operation Warp Speed is unleashed? They start giving just vast sums of money to a lot of different companies. Well, U.S. government is pledging about $1.2 billion to AstraZeneca in its fight — And Moderna, they got a lot of money, about a half a billion dollars in federal funding — Johnson & Johnson has been given a boost, nearly half a billion dollars to develop a Covid vaccine and treatments. And then in July, the government gave the biggest amount it had given out to date. This is a $1.6 billion — that’s billion with a B — contract to Novavax vaccines. It’s the largest — Up to $1.6 billion to a company called Novavax. This is a huge award for Novavax, which is a smaller company — Which was notable, because this is a company that had been around for more than 30 years. And yet, it had never in that history successfully brought a vaccine to market. Yeah, Novavax is unproven. They have been trying for decades. And so far, have not succeeded. We’ll be right back. So, Katie, why would Operation Warp Speed give up to $1.6 billion to Novavax, this company that has never brought a vaccine to market? Well, it was surprising because you know, only a year ago they were basically on the brink of collapse. Their stock was trading so low that it risked getting delisted from the NASDAQ. They had to sell their manufacturing facility to try and raise cash. And they had to lay off a number of their employees. And so you know, they were really struggling heading into 2020. But that’s kind of the way things work in the pharmaceutical industry. Failures are a part of the business. And so when 2020 came around and the coronavirus arrived, they got started working on a vaccine. And they ultimately came up with something that they felt was pretty promising. And so that’s when the government decided to give Novavax this $1.6 billion award. So this seems to be working exactly as Operation Warp Speed was designed to do, which is to give companies a big government assist so that we have as many potential vaccines arriving when we need them. Yeah, that’s right. But it also is potentially problematic. Anytime you have billions of dollars just kind of sloshing around, there’s going to be questions and scrutiny and people who want to know, you know, how are these decisions being made and why. And the contracts that have come out have been heavily redacted. There hasn’t been a lot of transparency around the process. And that always raises fears about whether there are conflicts of interest. So in the case of Novavax that question immediately came up, because two of their former executives used to be the directors of the unit at the Department of Health and Human Services that gives money to companies. Before Operation Warp Speed, Novavax had applied to that unit for vaccine funding and had actually reached out to one of those directors about the application in a way that director said crossed ethical lines. He felt discussing the application while the company’s vaccine was being considered could violate federal law, given that it could influence what was supposed to be a purely scientific review. The company has said that it did nothing wrong and it had gone through the proper channels. And when things weren’t moving quickly enough, they reached out to see how they could be moved more quickly. And questions like this around conflicts of interest have come up more broadly with Operation Warp Speed, because the person overseeing the program is a pharmaceutical industry veteran. Operation Warp Speed’s chief scientist will be Dr. Moncef Slaoui, a world — His name is Dr. Moncef Slaoui, and he was a former board number of one of the companies that received funding, Moderna. And he also holds millions of dollars in stock in another company that got government funding, GlaxoSmithKline, where he worked for 30 years. I have never been about the money, ever. He has said that he won’t allow his ties to interfere with his work on Operation Warp Speed. It’s been extremely painful for me that anybody would even think that I took this job to enrich myself or my former colleagues — And a government agency has reviewed the information and said that he can continue in his position. That’s all I have to say. I have a personal compass in ethics. And people who know me personally know that. But another reason why there’s so much scrutiny around these billion dollar deals is because once companies get that label of being Operation Warp Speed, it can be very financially lucrative for them and their investors. In fact, in the case of Novavax, their stock since May has jumped nearly 800 percent. Wow. Yeah, and that’s true of many of the companies that have gotten this label. They have seen their stocks surge on this vaccine news. Katie, listening to you tell the story of Novavax and its experience with Operation Warp Speed, I feel like I’m struck by two competing impulses. The first is that it feels admirable that the government is trying to throw caution to the wind, toss aside those old timelines when it comes to a vaccine, and just spend billions of dollars to save lives in the middle of this pandemic. But on the other hand, the idea of giving billions of dollars of our money — taxpayer money — to a bunch of private companies, some without much of a track record, some with complicated connections to the people granting them the money — that also feels kind of hairy. Yeah, I mean, it’s very much being sorted out as we speak. You know, everyone wants a vaccine. People are desperate for it, and the federal government has kind of wagered in a way that this is really what it takes in order to get that. So, Katie, at this point, companies are getting all this money to cross that valley of death you described. So tell me how warp speedy is all this? I mean, how fast is it moving? Well, things are moving pretty quickly. You know, with the help of Operation Warp Speed, the federal government has given money to seven different vaccine companies. And that’s a promise of nearly $11 billion. Wow. And three of those companies — Moderna, AstraZeneca and Pfizer — are in those late-stage trials to test whether the vaccine works. So that’s pretty impressive in a way? Yeah, I mean, so far, things have gone more or less according to the most aggressive schedules that have been laid out. And one thing that federal officials have said repeatedly is that when they talk about warp speed, the speed that they’re talking about is not the clinical trials themselves. They say the clinical trials themselves are not being rushed. What is being rushed is kind of everything on the outside — you know, these manufacturing deals, and analyzing the data, and kind of moving those gears of bureaucracy and making them go as quickly as they possibly can. That being said, there’s fears among scientists that there’s this X factor of President Trump — We have a lot of vaccines under study, by the way — — and his urgency to approve a vaccine. So what’s the earliest we could see that — a vaccine? Sooner than the end of the year, could be much sooner. Soon than November 3? Oh, I think in some cases, yeah, it’s possible before, but right around that time. Their fear is that he wants to approve one before his election, and that he could push his F.D.A. to approve a vaccine before it’s truly ready. Will that help you in the election? It wouldn’t hurt. It wouldn’t hurt. But I’m not doing it — I’m doing it not for the election. I want it fast, because I want to save a lot of lives. And, Katie, is that a legitimate fear? My sense is that the Food and Drug Administration, which approves drugs in the U.S. does answer to the health and human services secretary who does answer to the president. But is it reasonable to think that the president can actually stick his finger into the approval process for a vaccine? Well, everyone from the F.D.A. commissioner to others in the federal government have publicly said — The F.D.A. will look at that data. And on a science-based decision will make a determination as to the safety and efficacy and whether or not it will be approved. — they will be guided by the science, and they will follow the guidelines that they’ve set out for whether they will approve a vaccine or not. Historically, the F.D.A. has based their decisions on science. They will do it this time also, I’m certain. I appreciate it. Thanks for your assurances that we’ll have a safe — But the concern is whether there could be a little bit of a middle ground. Rather than a full-blown approval, could there be an emergency use authorization where a vaccine could be approved, maybe for a limited group of people — say frontline health care workers — prematurely or early, before it’s made widely available to the public. And of course, that has already happened in the case of hydroxychloroquine. Because just a few months ago the F.D.A. authorized the emergency use of that as a treatment for the coronavirus, and it was a drug that President Trump himself constantly promoted and talked about and said we should all be using. And it turned out it didn’t work well — correct me if I’m wrong, Katie. It even presented safety risks and the F.D.A. ended up rescinding that emergency authorization. That’s right. And so there are fears that could happen again — that the F.D.A. could be influenced by politics. You can also see the flip side though too, which is that perhaps the agency could see how it didn’t go so well, and could be newly determined to not make that mistake again. So, Katie, a quick gut check here. Just how close are we to getting a vaccine from Operation Warp Speed, something that we could start distributing across the United States? Well, first of all, it’s important to remember that a vaccine is a crucial step. But it won’t mean the immediate end of the epidemic. It takes time to get the vaccine to people. Not everyone will want to get vaccinated. And it could be more effective for some people than for others. That being said, the best estimates that people inside the federal government have given is that something could be available, if all goes as planned, by the end of the year or the beginning of next year. You know, already there are some promising candidates. And one of the companies that has released some of the most promising results is actually Novavax. Huh, this company that had never really developed a vaccine before? That’s right. They recently released some results from their early trials. And they tested the blood of the people who had been given their vaccine. And they found pretty high levels of antibodies against the coronavirus. That doesn’t really prove yet whether it works. We’ll need those late-stage clinical trials to really know for sure. But it’s a really promising hint that it could work. And that’s gotten the scientists that we spoke to fairly optimistic about it. Katie, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thanks for having me. On Sunday, The Times reported that the Trump administration is working with four states — California, Florida, Minnesota and North Dakota — as well as the city of Philadelphia to develop plans for distributing an eventual coronavirus vaccine. The government is not prioritizing those communities to receive the vaccine. But instead, chose them because they represent different population densities and infection rates. Among the questions that the government is trying to answer is where to store the vaccine, and what kinds of clinics should distribute it. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. What you are witnessing is a president of the United States who is doing everything he can to suppress the vote, make it harder for people to engage in mail-in balloting at a time when people will be putting their lives on the line by having to go out to a polling station and vote. On Sunday, congressional Democrats acted to block President Trump from trying to undermine the United States Postal Service and mail-in voting, something that the president has suggested in interviews that he may seek to do. So what Trump is saying is we’re going to do everything we can — and this is not me talking. This is what Trump himself said. Look — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that she would call members back from their annual summer recess to vote on legislation that would prevent the president from making changes to the postal service. At the same time, House Democrats said that they would hold an emergency hearing about the postal service and would demand to hear from the postmaster general, a Trump ally and donor. Democrats said that the urgency stems from a warning from the postal service sent to states recently that it may not be able to meet deadlines for delivering mail-in ballots. That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow. The Christian pastor accused by South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, of impeding the government’s effort to fight the virus tested positive on Monday, officials said. The pastor, the Rev. Jun Kwang-hoon, leads Sarang Jeil Church in Seoul, which has become the center of the latest outbreak in South Korea, with more than 300 cases reported among its members and contacts in the past six days. Even before his church grabbed headlines with the outbreak, Mr. Jun has been known widely in South Korea for organizing large anti-government rallies against Mr. Moon. During these rallies, the conservative pastor called for Mr. Moon’s ouster, calling the liberal president a “North Korean spy” and accusing him of trying to “communize” South Korea. Mr. Jun’s infection was confirmed on Monday by Lee Seung-ro, the mayor of Seongbuk-gu, a district of Seoul, where Mr. Jun’s church is located. Mr. Jun was hospitalized on Monday after he tested positive, Mr. Lee said in a Facebook post. Mr. Jun and some of his church followers attended a large anti-government rally in downtown Seoul on Saturday, ignoring government orders to isolate themselves at home amid a surge in infections among their congregation, officials said. Mr. Moon called their behavior “an unpardonable act against the safety of the people.” Mass infections in Mr. Jun’s church and another church in Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds the capital city, have helped push the daily caseload in South Korea to three-digit figures in the past four days. South Korea reported 197 new cases on Monday. “What we see now is believed to be an early stage of what could become a big wave of infections,” said Jung Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Monday. “If we fail to control the spread now, the number of cases could explode exponentially.” Health officials said on Monday that they have so far counted 319 patients linked to Mr. Jun’s Sarang Jeil Church. The outbreak is the second largest cluster reported in South Korea, following the mass infections in the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the central city of Daegu in February and March claimed 5,200 patients. It was not immediately clear where and how Mr. Jun contracted the virus. But his infection prompted the authorities to repeat their call on all the thousands of participants in the Saturday rally, as well as all members of Mr. Jun’s church, to report for testing. GLOBAL ROUNDUP TRANSCRIPT I should be clear that the Electoral Commission since April has planned for a range of scenarios, including the possibility of an election period where the country is at Alert Level 2 and with some areas of the country at Alert Level 3. There is no suggestion at this point that New Zealand will be in these elevated alert levels during the September election. Having weighed up all these factors and taken wide soundings I have decided on balance to move the election by four weeks to the 17th of October. At the end of last week, I was advised that this date is achievable and presents no greater risk than had we retained the status quo. I have also been advised that a moving to a 17 October election day, the Commission will be able to leverage and draw on much of the work already undertaken to deliver the election. Ultimately the 17th of October and approximately nine weeks’ time provides sufficient time for parties to plan around the range of circumstances we could be campaigning under, for the Electoral Commission to prepare and for voters to feel assured of a safe, accessible and credible election. New Zealand said on Monday that it would postpone its national election by four weeks as a cluster of new virus cases continues to spread in Auckland, its largest city. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who has the sole authority to determine when people cast ballots, said she had consulted with all the major parties before deciding to move the election from Sept. 19 to Oct. 17. The latest possible date she could have chosen was Nov. 21. Ms. Ardern called the new date a compromise that “provides sufficient time for parties to plan around the range of circumstances we could be campaigning under, for the electoral commission to prepare, and for voters to feel assured of a safe, accessible and critical election.” But she ruled out further change. Even if the outbreak worsens, she said, “we will be sticking with the date we have.” The election delay came as the mysterious cluster of new cases grew to 58 on Monday. Health officials are still scrambling to test thousands of workers at airports and other points of entry, along with quarantine facilities and a frozen food warehouse, as they try to determine how the virus re-emerged last week after 102 days without known community transmission in the country. In other developments around the world: Australia recorded its deadliest day of the pandemic, reporting 25 deaths in the previous 24 hours on Monday, all in the state of Victoria. The country has had more than 23,000 cases and more than 400 deaths, according to a Times database. In some poor countries — and poverty-stricken areas of developed ones — access to broadband and computers is scarce or nonexistent, making online learning an impossible option. That has led to a renewed reliance on educational television, which is having a moment after years of heavy investment in internet learning. In countries including Peru, Tanzania and Indonesia, televisions have become tools to either provide or supplement students’ remote learning. India reported 941 deaths on Monday, taking the country’s death toll past 50,000. Last week, India overtook Britain as the country with the world’s fourth-highest number of deaths, after the United States, Brazil and Mexico. Thousands of people in Madrid protested on Sunday against restrictions the Spanish government implemented — including mask wearing in all indoor and outdoor spaces and an order for nightclubs to close — in response to a recent surge in cases. The leader of the Madrid’s regional government, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, on Monday said the anti-mask protests were “irresponsible,” and she called on citizens to show solidarity in the fight against the virus. South Africa loosened some virus-related restrictions on Monday, including lifting a ban on the sale of tobacco and alcohol and permitting travel between provinces. Restaurants and taverns were allowed to return to normal business, subject to strict hygiene regulations, and gatherings of up to 50 people were again allowed. South Africa has the world’s fifth-highest caseload, with at least 587,000 cases, according to a Times database. It’s lights out for discos and clubs in Italy. As infections in the country creep back up — especially among young people — the authorities are clamping down. In addition to ordering dancing establishments closed, they are requiring the outdoor use of masks from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. in popular gathering spots. “We cannot nullify the sacrifices made in past months,” Italy’s health minister, Roberto Speranza, said on Facebook. Japan’s economy shrank by 7.8 percent in the second quarter of the year, posting its worst performance on record as the country reeled from the effects of the pandemic. Thailand’s economy, which depends heavily on tourism and exports, shrank by 12.2 percent in the second quarter, its biggest contraction since 1998, the state planning council said on Monday. Thailand barred visitors from abroad starting in early April to prevent new cases of the virus. The strategy seems to be working: The country has gone 83 days without recording a new case of community transmission. The Canadian Football League said Monday that it would not play a season in the fall and that it would instead focus on trying to stage a season in 2021. League officials said a lack of live fans at games would knock out its top source of revenue, and the league did not get governmental support to stage the season in a single city. TRANSCRIPT The guidance goes out today on gyms — basically the outline is 33 percent capacity. There are health requirements that are in the guidelines that have to be maintained to their ventilation requirements. One of the requirements is mandating masks at all times. Gyms can open as soon as Aug. 24. But the locality must open them by Sept. 2. Localities can also determine whether or not the gym has classes inside it. Some gyms have classes — localities can decide whether or not those classes can be undertaken. The local elected will make the decision in a jurisdiction, and the local health departments must inspect before or within two weeks to make sure all the guidelines are in place. Gyms in New York, which have remained shut for months even as the state made progress in fighting the virus, will be allowed to open again as soon as Aug. 24 and no later than Sept. 2, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Monday. Mr. Cuomo’s announcement came with several caveats: Gyms will be limited to a third of their total capacity, and people would be required to wear masks at all times. The state will also require that gyms have sign-in forms to assist with contact-tracing efforts. Local governments will also need to inspect gyms to make sure they meet the state’s requirements before they open or within two weeks of their opening. Local governments can stop gyms from holding indoor classes, Mr. Cuomo said. It was not immediately clear when New York City would clear gyms for reopening, or which agency would be responsible for conducting inspections or enforcing regulations. Mitch Schwartz, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said that the city would develop its inspection system in the coming weeks, but that it did not plan to initially allow indoor fitness classes when gyms reopened. Still, the decision marked a significant step forward in the state’s return to the pre-pandemic status quo, even as officials have grown concerned about another large outbreak. Epidemiologists have also said that they believe the risk of transmission is higher indoors, which led Mr. Cuomo in June to keep gyms, as well as movie theaters, shopping malls and bowling alleys, closed. Similar concerns also led state officials to delay allowing indoor dining in New York City, even as they allowed it elsewhere in the state. Though some businesses and trainers have tried to adapt to regulations by moving classes or sessions outside, struggling gym owners had been frustrated by the state’s decision for weeks. More than 1,500 of them joined a class-action lawsuit filed last week that aimed to force New York to allow their reopening. Lightweight neck gaiters, a tube of fabric worn around the neck, have been popular during the pandemic with runners, cyclists and people with beards because they can be pulled up to cover the nose and the mouth and used as a mask. But in recent days, there has been a backlash. It started after a small study from Duke University showed that a neck gaiter performed poorly when a person wearing a gaiter said the words “Stay healthy, people” five times. During that test, the scientists observed a slight increase in the number of expelled saliva particles when the person wore the gaiter than when the wearer wore nothing at all. Although the technique the study’s authors used was not a reliable way to measure particles, and their finding was not statistically meaningful, they hypothesized that wearing a neck gaiter might cause more small droplets to spew through the fabric, not fewer. A wave of alarmist reports on news sites and social media quickly followed. “Wearing a neck gaiter could be worse than wearing no mask at all,” read the headline in The Washington Post. Even the study’s authors said their data had been misconstrued. “Our intent was not to say this mask doesn’t work, or never use neck gaiters,” said Martin Fischer, an associate research professor in the department of chemistry at Duke and a co-author of the study. On Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California called for an investigation into what he described as a major utility failure that was even more alarming set against the backdrop of the pandemic, when people, many largely confined inside, may be more dependent than ever on electricity: rolling blackouts over the weekend, caused by a record-shattering heat wave. And a wave of wildfires are also posing particular challenges in the pandemic, Mr. Newsom said, as officials struggle to shelter residents forced to flee, and the state’s firefighting force has been depleted thanks to outbreaks in the state’s prisons. The power issues and wildfires could also have impact on education. A reporter asked, for instance, about how the state would address the loss of remote learning time, if students lose power. “In extenuating circumstances, we have to be flexible,” he said. The blackouts came not long after California leaders scrambled to address problems with the state’s virus data reporting system, which clouded case counts and threw into question the list of counties where virus transmission is particularly troubling. Mr. Newsom said on Monday that the backlog of cases arising from the data glitch had been cleared, and that the state’s seven-day average reflected that. The state’s positivity rate and other measures, such as hospitalizations, he said, were moving in the right direction.  To achieve so-called herd immunity — the point at which the virus can no longer spread because there are not enough vulnerable humans — scientists have suggested that perhaps 70 percent of a given population must be immune, through vaccination or because they survived the infection. Now some researchers are wrestling with a hopeful possibility. In interviews with The New York Times, more than a dozen scientists said that the threshold is likely to be much lower: just 50 percent, perhaps even less. The new estimates result from complicated statistical modeling of the pandemic, and the models have all taken divergent approaches, yielding inconsistent estimates. It is not certain that any community in the world has enough residents now immune to the virus to resist a second wave. But in parts of New York, London and Mumbai, for example, it is not inconceivable that there is already substantial immunity to the coronavirus, scientists said. “I’m quite prepared to believe that there are pockets in New York City and London which have substantial immunity,” said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “What happens this winter will reflect that.” The initial calculations for the herd immunity threshold assumed that each community member had the same susceptibility to the virus and mixed randomly with everyone else in the community. “That doesn’t happen in real life,” said Dr. Saad Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health. “Herd immunity could vary from group to group, and subpopulation to subpopulation,” and even by postal codes, he said.
