A wild day of sparring, as the Trump and Biden campaigns battle over the next debates. Trump calls for Obama and Biden to be indicted and describes Harris as a ‘monster’ in an hourlong TV interview. The F.B.I. discloses a plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. McConnell says he’s been avoiding the White House for months because of lack of virus precautions there. Pelosi rules out aid covering only airlines as Trump claims stimulus talks are back on. Friends of Amy Dorris, who accused Trump of sexual assault, recall hearing her claims in 1997. The Pence-Harris debate drew far more viewers than the Pence-Kaine debate did in 2016. They’re voting as if it’s their last chance, which it might well be. Remote, or in-person? One more debate, or two? The Trump campaign, the Biden campaign and the Commission on Presidential Debates engaged in a head-snapping round of sparring on Thursday over when and how the next face-offs should be held, and how they could take place safely amid the health concerns raised since President Trump contracted the coronavirus. The morning began with the commission announcing that the next debate, scheduled for Oct. 15 in Miami, would be held remotely “in order to protect the health and safety of all involved.” The Biden camp was open to the idea, but Mr. Trump rejected it as “ridiculous.” That prompted Joseph R. Biden Jr’s campaign to call for the debate to be pushed back a week, to Oct. 22, “so that the president is not able to evade accountability.” “Joe Biden was prepared to accept the C.P.D.’s proposal for a virtual Town Hall, but the president has refused, as Donald Trump clearly does not want to face questions from the voters about his failures on Covid and the economy,” Mr. Biden’s deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said in a statement. The Trump campaign seemed open to that. Bill Stepien, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, issued a statement agreeing to pushing the debate back a week — and suggesting without evidence that the commission was trying to help Mr. Biden. “We agree that this should happen on Oct. 22, and accordingly, the third debate should then be shifted back one week to Oct. 29,” Mr. Stepien said. Not so fast, the Biden campaign said. Ms. Bedingfield issued a new statement, suggesting that the Oct. 22 debate should be the last and final one of the campaign. “Donald Trump doesn’t make the debate schedule; the Debate Commission does,” Ms. Bedingfield said in a statement. “We accepted the three dates — Sept. 29, Oct. 15, and Oct. 22 — in June. Trump chose today to pull out of the Oct. 15th debate. Trump’s erratic behavior does not allow him to rewrite the calendar, and pick new dates of his choosing. “We look forward to participating in the final debate, scheduled for Oct. 22, which already is tied for the latest debate date in 40 years,” she said. “Donald Trump can show up, or he can decline again. That’s his choice.” ABC News said in the afternoon that Mr. Biden had agreed to appear at a town hall, moderated by the anchor George Stephanopoulos, on Oct. 15, the night the second debate had been set to take place. Producers at ABC News finalized plans for the Biden town hall on Thursday after Mr. Trump withdrew from the debate, according to two people familiar with the deliberations. It was another sign of how the coronavirus, which sent Mr. Trump to the hospital and has spread through the White House and official Washington, has upended the last month of the campaign. The debate commission has the power to set rules and safety protocols, and Mr. Trump’s diagnosis and the spreading outbreak complicated its task considerably. The Biden campaign announced that Mr. Biden had again tested negative for the coronavirus on Thursday; the Trump administration has declined to provide key details about his health since he was hospitalized.    Mr. Trump had immediately objected to the concept of a virtual debate in an interview with Fox Business, saying: “I’m not going to waste my time on a virtual debate, that’s not what debating is all about. You sit behind a computer and do a debate — it’s ridiculous.” His campaign has sought to shift attention away from his response to the pandemic, and a virtual debate would by its very structure call attention to the degree to which the virus has upended the country. But Mr. Trump’s resistance put his campaign in a difficult position: Mr. Trump’s first debate outing, last week in Cleveland, got poor reviews, as he repeatedly interrupted and heckled Mr. Biden and the moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News. The campaign was anxious for a second chance. Mr. Biden, speaking briefly to reporters before boarding a plane to Arizona on Thursday, suggested that he would be open to following the commission’s recommendations for a virtual debate, and said that Mr. Trump had once again shown himself to be impulsive and unpredictable. “We don’t know what the president is going to do,” Mr. Biden said. “He changes his mind every second.” — Michael M. Grynbaum, Neil Vigdor and Michael Cooper President Trump attacked two cabinet members who are closest to him and called for the indictment of his predecessor, President Obama, and his opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., as he revisited the events of the 2016 campaign in a meandering, hourlong telephone interview on Fox Business Channel on Thursday. Mr. Trump called Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee and the first woman of color on a major national ticket, a “monster.” He said the F.B.I. director was “disappointing.” He posited that he might have contracted the coronavirus from a member of a military family. He maintained that he is almost off medical treatments for the virus. And he complained about not being allowed to hold rallies while he remains in isolation. “I don’t think I’m contagious at all,” Mr. Trump said, although his positive diagnosis was revealed last Friday and people with the virus are typically contagious for at least a week and often longer. Of his treatments, he insisted, “I think I’m taking almost nothing.” His doctor has not said how long he will remain on steroids. Mr. Trump’s interview effectively wiped out attention being paid to the vice-presidential debate the night before, which Trump allies felt had gone well for Vice President Mike Pence. The president’s circuitous conversation with the host Maria Bartiromo came as he has been eager to dispel questions about his health after spending four days at Walter Reed, following a drop in his oxygen levels and a fever, chills and a cough related to the virus. But Mr. Trump’s standing in the race against Mr. Biden, whom he trails in polls, was clearly frustrating to him. Mr. Trump criticized both Attorney General Bill Barr and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, two cabinet members often described as among his closest aides. Mr. Trump said of investigations into the origins of the probe of his 2016 campaign and whether it conspired with Russian officials, “Bill Barr is going to go down either as the greatest attorney general in the history of the country or he’s going to go down as a very sad, sad situation. I mean, I’ll be honest with you. He’s got all the information he needs.” At another point, Mr. Trump took aim at Mr. Pompeo for not releasing documents related to Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state under President Obama. “They’re in the State Department, but Mike Pompeo has been unable to get them out, which is very sad, actually. I’m not happy about him for that reason,” Mr. Trump said. The president has been tweeting this week about documents that purportedly show that Mrs. Clinton planned to gin up a scandal tying Mr. Trump to Russia. Democrats say the documents that the administration released are misleading. “These people should be indicted — this was the greatest political crime in the history of our country,” Mr. Trump said. “And that includes Obama, and it includes Biden.” Mr. Trump also criticized the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, for not backing up Mr. Trump’s view, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that voting by mail is rife with fraud, and he declined to commit to keeping Mr. Wray in a second term. And he referred to Ms. Harris, Mr. Biden’s running mate, as a “monster” twice and a “communist” four times. He tried to downplay the seriousness of the medication he’d been taking, as well as the virus itself. After calling an experimental antibody cocktail that is still being studied a “cure,” Mr. Trump claimed he didn’t need to take medicine. “It’s not a heavy steroid,” Mr. Trump said of the heavy steroid he’s been taking, dexamethasone. And he theorized that he could have caught the virus from a relative of a fallen service member at a ceremony he hosted for Gold Star families. Mr. Trump said those relatives insisted on hugging him or thanking him. “I can’t back up, Maria, and say, ‘Give me room, I want room, give me 12 feet, stay 12 feet away.’ They come within an inch of my face sometimes,” he said. “They want to hug me and they want to kiss me. And they do. And frankly, I’m not telling them to back up.” — Maggie Haberman Six men were arrested and accused of plotting with a militia group to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, the authorities announced on Thursday. The men, who the F.B.I. said espoused anti-government views, had talked about taking Ms. Whitmer, a Democrat, hostage since at least the summer, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court and unsealed on Thursday. They had surveilled Ms. Whitmer’s vacation home in August and September and indicated that they wanted to take her hostage before the presidential election in November, Richard J. Trask II, an F.B.I. special agent, said in the criminal complaint. He said the F.B.I. believed the men were planning to buy explosives this week for their attempt. Several of the men had talked about creating a society in which they could be “self-sufficient” and one said he wanted 200 men to storm the Statehouse in Lansing, Mich, the complaint said. Over the summer, the men gathered for firearms training and combat drills and tried to make explosives; in July, one of the men said the group should take Ms. Whitmer hostage and move her to a “secure location” in Wisconsin for a “trial,” the agent said. The F.B.I. said it had learned so much about the group by intercepting encrypted messages and because it had undercover agents and confidential informants working with the group. The six men — five of whom live in Michigan and one of whom lives in Delaware — were charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping, which can carry a life sentence. More details were expected at a news conference later on Thursday with the state’s attorney general. Ms. Whitmer has been the subject of right-wing protests for measures she imposed to control the spread of the coronavirus. In April, President Trump had openly encouraged protests against social distancing restrictions in Michigan and several other states with stay-at-home orders, just a day after his administration announced a set of guidelines for how the nation’s governors should carry out an orderly reopening of their communities on their own timetables. In a series of all-caps tweets that started just after a Fox News report on the protests, the president declared, “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” and “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” He also lashed out at Virginia, where the state’s Democratic governor and legislature have pushed for strict gun control measures, saying: “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!”  — Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Shaila Dewan Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said on Thursday that he had been avoiding the White House since midsummer over concerns that officials there were not taking proper precautions against the coronavirus. “My impression was that their approach to how to handle this was different from mine and what I insisted that we do in the Senate, which is to wear a mask and practice social distancing,” Mr. McConnell told reporters in Hebron, Ky. He said he had not visited the White House since Aug. 6, when he met with President Trump to discuss negotiations over additional stimulus legislation. The decision appears to have been a prudent one now that the White House has become a virus hot spot, with Mr. Trump the most prominent to contract the disease. More than a dozen White House guests and employees, including two of Mr. McConnell’s fellow Senate Republicans, were infected after attending an event Mr. Trump held last month to announce his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Mr. McConnell, who is leading the drive to confirm Judge Barrett, had been noticeably absent from the largely maskless gathering. Mr. McConnell did not specifically comment on Judge Barrett’s nomination ceremony. Though he has closely aligned himself with Mr. Trump politically, Mr. McConnell, who is 78 and suffered from polio as a child, has consistently struck a different, more sobering tone when discussing the virus. He has publicly urged Americans to wear masks, repeatedly warned that the pandemic’s grip will be long and stated that he believes a vaccine will not be widely available until next year. “This is not over,” Mr. McConnell said. “We are going to have to work through it.” — Nicholas Fandos Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, hosted his daughter’s Atlanta wedding indoors in defiance of state and municipal guidelines that at the time limited gatherings to 10 people or less. The wedding, held at Atlanta’s Biltmore Ballrooms in May, was first reported Thursday by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. It took place early in the coronavirus pandemic, as Americans were canceling or postponing their own weddings and other long-planned gatherings to comply with public health restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. Photographs from the May 31 event, posted online, show no masks or distancing among the crowd of several dozen tuxedo-clad attendees. In one image, Mr. Meadows can be seen delivering a father-of-the-bride speech before a band with at least eight members. Another shows a 21-member wedding party posing with the newly married couple. Mr. Meadows and his wife, Debbie, are shown during the recessional walking together down a flower petal-strewn aisle while 50 people seated closely together watch. Mr. Meadows declined to comment on the wedding. Mike Moon, a photographer for Ember Studio, which photographed the event, said during an interview Thursday that people who worked to put the wedding on wore masks but most of the guests did not. Matt Trivett, who owns Ember Studio, said he did not wish to comment about whether he and his staff felt safe at the event. “Vendors wore masks and so did some of the guests off and on when they wanted to,” Mr. Moon said. Other photographs show Mr. Meadows dancing with his daughter, Haley, various groomsmen shaking hands and much dancing and mingling. The event would not have appeared out of the ordinary in pre-pandemic times. None of the photographs posted in the online wedding album show any guests wearing masks. More than 7,000 Georgians have died from the coronavirus and 310,000 have tested positive for it. Maggie Haberman contributed reporting. — Reid J. Epstein Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California on Thursday said she would not agree to stand-alone aid package for airlines unless the Trump administration committed to a broader pandemic relief plan to help struggling Americans, declaring that “there is no stand-alone bill without a bigger bill.” Her comments cast doubt on the prospects for a compromise just hours after President Trump had given an upbeat assessment, saying in an interview that he had reconsidered his decision to pull the plug on bipartisan negotiations on a stimulus plan until after the election. “I shut down talks two days ago because they weren’t working out,” Mr. Trump told Fox Business. “Now they’re starting to work out.” The prospect of a deal remained remote, given the steep political obstacles that have hampered agreement for months. Still, Ms. Pelosi and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, have continued to talk privately about a potential aid measure for airlines to prevent tens of thousands of workers from being furloughed or laid off, and were scheduled to do so again later Thursday. Mr. Trump said the discussions had also touched on the possibility of another round of $1,200 stimulus checks. “We’re talking about airlines and we’re talking about a bigger deal than airlines,” he said. Ms. Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill that she had made it clear to Mr. Mnuchin on Wednesday evening that her willingness to consider an airline rescue measure was contingent on the administration’s agreement to a broader stimulus plan. “We’re happy to review what that stand-alone bill would look like, as part of a bigger bill, if there’s a bigger bill,” she said. “We’re at the table — we want to continue the conversation.” Republicans blocked a Democratic proposal for airline aid on Friday, calling it partisan and too expensive. A similar Republican bill in the Senate would repurpose unspent funds from the $2.2 trillion stimulus law enacted last spring, a move that many Democrats have opposed. Still, Mr. Trump appeared to be hoping anew for some kind of deal before Election Day, after his move to publicly scuttle the stimulus discussions prompted alarm among Republicans that voters would blame them for the collapse of the effort. — Emily Cochrane As Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris clashed over the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic Wednesday night, Mr. Pence defended the White House’s record without addressing its fundamental failures, while Ms. Harris accused him and President Trump of presiding over a public-health catastrophe. Ms. Harris delivered a comprehensive denunciation of the Trump administration’s policies, ranging from the economy and climate change to health care regulation and taxes. As Ms. Harris attacked Mr. Trump, the vice president sought to recast Mr. Trump’s record on the pandemic and other issues in conventional and inoffensive terms, though often in plain defiance of the facts. The vice president made misleading or plainly false claims about White House policies on a range of subjects weighing down Mr. Trump in the presidential race. Mr. Pence claimed that the president had a plan to protect people with pre-existing medical conditions, even though he does not; hailed the “V-shaped recovery” of the economy despite  the latest government data; and repeatedly claimed that Mr. Trump would always “follow the science” on climate change even though he has spent his term denying the scientific consensus on global warming and dismantling environmental regulations. After Mr. Trump’s belligerent performance against Mr. Biden last week, the Harris-Pence forum in Salt Lake City mostly stood out for how different it was from that debate. It was for the most part a gloves-on affair, more akin to conventional political debates of yesteryear, albeit one playing out in a moment of national crisis. — Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin Three weeks ago, a news story caught the attention of Dawn Capp, a Texas math teacher. A former model had accused President Trump of assault, the latest in a long line of sexual misconduct complaints against him. At the United States Open tennis tournament in 1997, the woman told The Guardian, he groped and forcibly kissed her. Ms. Capp voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. But she immediately believed the story, she said, because she had heard it more than two decades ago from Amy Dorris, the woman making the allegation and one of Ms. Capp’s oldest friends. The Trump campaign has called Ms. Dorris’s account “totally false.” “This is just another pathetic attempt to attack President Trump right before the election,” said Jenna Ellis, a legal adviser to the Trump campaign. In interviews with The Times, Ms. Dorris recounted meeting Mr. Trump nearly a quarter-century ago, when she was 24 and her boyfriend Jason Binn whisked her off to New York for a long weekend. Mr. Binn had a network of celebrity friends, but he and Mr. Trump, then 51, seemed especially close. As the couple spent time with the real-estate developer in his box at the U.S. Open, at Trump Tower and in limousines, he wouldn’t leave her alone,   and his hands wandered repeatedly to her waist and her legs, Ms. Dorris said. “It was like he claimed me — that’s how it felt,” she said. On a Friday afternoon, Ms. Dorris said, she excused herself to use a bathroom behind the box’s private seating area. When she emerged, Mr. Trump was waiting, she said. He told her that she belonged with him and moved toward her. “It started as him trying to kiss me,” she said. She said she had told him to stop, first with giggles, and then in a more serious tone. He had “a tiger grip — he wasn’t letting me go,” she said. Mr. Trump shoved his tongue into her mouth, she said. “I couldn’t get loose from him,” she said. “His hands were all over me.” She returned to her seat, embarrassed, and pretended nothing had happened, but soon phoned her mother and a friend for counsel. (Both confirmed Ms. Dorris’s account of the calls.) In 2016, other women began to publicly tell stories about Mr. Trump, some of them similar. The disclosure of the “Access Hollywood” tape, which captured Mr. Trump making crude remarks about sexually assaulting women, provoked widespread outrage, and recognition among Ms. Dorris and the friends in whom she had confided. After more than a year of speaking privately with The Guardian, Ms. Dorris said, she decided to go public. A registered independent who once served as a campaign volunteer for Jeb Bush, the Republican former Florida governor, she said she wanted to speak out about Mr. Trump’s character. “It’s the person, not the party,” she said. “This man should not be the president.”  — Jodi Kantor More than 50 million viewers watched Wednesday night’s vice-presidential debate across the major broadcast networks and cable news channels, easily besting the results of the 2016 vice-presidential debate, according to preliminary figures from the research firm Nielsen. The final viewership figures for the debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will only grow when Nielsen releases final figures later on Thursday, giving it a chance to become one of the most-viewed vice-presidential debates ever. Only 37 million people tuned into the 2016 debate between Mr. Pence and Tim Kaine, one of the least-watched debates since Nielsen started tracking the ratings in 1976. The most viewed vice-presidential debate ever was between Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Sarah Palin in 2008. That match-up logged nearly 70 million viewers. Other networks that carried the debate — including Telemundo, PBS and Univision — will be factored into the final tally. Nielsen also recently began measuring viewers who stream the event to their television screen, which will also help raise total figures, though viewers who watched the debate solely on their laptop or phone are not included. — John Koblin Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, accused Democrats Wednesday of pursuing a vision of “rank democracy” at odds with safeguarding personal “liberty” — articulating a philosophy Democrats see as underpinning a conservative push to restrict voting rights and environmental regulations. Mr. Lee, the son of Ronald Reagan’s solicitor general Rex E. Lee and a former clerk to the conservative Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, began a long series of Twitter pronouncements a half-hour into Wednesday’s vice-presidential debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris in his home state’s capital, Salt Lake City. “We’re not a democracy,” wrote Mr. Lee, 49, who is in isolation after testing positive for the coronavirus last week. “The word ‘democracy’ appears nowhere in the Constitution, perhaps because our form of government is not a democracy. It’s a constitutional republic. To me it matters. It should matter to anyone who worries about the excessive accumulation of power in the hands of the few.” His last tweet, posted just after midnight local time, concluded, apparently without spell-checking: “Democracy isn’t the objective; liberty, peace, and prospefity are. We want the human condition to flourish. Rank democracy can thwart that.” Mr. Lee’s statements elicited criticism from progressives who saw them as an attempt to rationalize Republican attempts to suppress the vote. The New York University historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat called his comments an “escalation of GOP and WH rhetoric about protestors being a mob and Dems being ‘too dangerous to rule,’” adding, “Such talk often precedes ‘exceptional’ and authoritarian gov’t actions. Look for more of this in future.” It was not clear what prompted the declarations, although Mr. Lee has been a critic of executive-branch overreach, environmental regulations and Democratic efforts to expand mail-in balloting. In 2016, he questioned whether Mr. Trump, whom he now supports, had “authoritarian" tendencies. To some extent, Mr. Lee was saying out loud what many conservatives have been saying quietly for years: that redistribution of wealth through taxation or attempts to regulate business are a threat to liberty, even if they are widely popular. “Government is the official use of coercive force — nothing more and nothing less. The Constitution protects us by limiting the use of government force,” he wrote late Wednesday. Not all of his tweets were about democracy and freedom, however. “We consume more Jello on a per capita basis than any state in the Union,” he wrote of Utah as the debate got underway. — Glenn Thrush AD WATCH Amid the chaotic news cycle of the election, there has been some groundbreaking reporting from Bloomberg News about what Exxon and other oil companies knew about climate change, and how they spent billions to bury the information. Now the L.C.V. Victory Fund, the super PAC allied with the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group, is taking the issue to the presidential stage, to Big Oil, and to President Trump. It’s a familiar, and potent, attack often levied against corporations that profit while damaging public health: Wealthy executives are never made to feel the true repercussions of their actions. The ad features actors playing oil moguls lounging in mansions and acknowledging that they know that “the world is on fire” but that “this climate thing is your problem.” One faux executive explains how oil companies “invested in political campaigns” as the screen shows President Trump calling human-caused climate change “a hoax.” He lauds the president for “rolling back all those fossil fuel regulations.” The ad ends with a nod to future generations, as one executive turns to the camera says, “You got a lot of work to do, because your kids are going to need it,” then toasts Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump did indeed call global warming a hoax on the campaign trail in 2015. And his administration has rolled back more than five dozen environmental regulations, according to a tally kept by The Times. In 2015, Inside Climate News reported that Exxon’s own internal research and data showed that the company was aware of the impact of fossil fuels on global warming for decades, and that it played down studies on climate change by sowing uncertainty. This week, Bloomberg News reported that “Exxon Mobil Corp. had plans to increase annual carbon-dioxide emissions by as much as the output of the entire nation of Greece,” with an internal assessment of its investment strategy showing “yearly emissions rising 17 percent by 2025.” (The company said in a statement to Bloomberg that the assessment was preliminary and that its projections had since changed.) A $2 million campaign on national cable, as well as digitally in Arizona, a swing state that Mr. Trump won in 2016 but where Joseph R. Biden is now leading in polls. Climate change is among the most important issues to young voters, and the threat to the global climate, with the daily reminders of vast wildfires and powerful hurricanes, is a galvanizing force this election cycle. Directing that energy in the electorate at villainous wealthy executives and tying them to Mr. Trump directly injects the president into a situation most voters recoil at: the wealthy taking advantage of the rest. — Nick Corasaniti Maya D. Wiley, a former top lawyer for Mayor Bill de Blasio who has gained a national following as a political and legal analyst for MSNBC, announced Wednesday night that she was running for mayor of New York City and immediately sought to distance herself from her former boss. In a campaign launch video, Ms. Wiley pointedly did not mention Mr. de Blasio by name, but invoked his tenure as she pointed to a “crisis of confidence in our city’s leadership.” Mr. de Blasio must leave office next year because of term limits. “Some will say I don’t sound like past mayors or look like them or think like them, and I say yes, I don’t — that is the point,” said Ms. Wiley, who is Black. “I am not a conventional candidate. But changing it up isn’t the risk. Electing the same kinds of people, bringing the same old broken promises over and over again and expecting things will be different — that’s the risk we can’t afford right now.” Her announcement had been expected for months after Ms. Wiley left her role at MSNBC in July to explore a run. The mayor’s race next year has been reshaped by the pandemic and by massive Black Lives Matter protests in the city. By urging voters to support her “if you’re tired of the same old thing,” Ms. Wiley cast herself as an outsider, despite her affiliation with the de Blasio administration, a strategy that would distinguish her from two leading Democratic candidates — Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, and Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller — who are longtime public servants. Maya Wiley is also a former head of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent agency that investigates complaints from the public about police misconduct. She plans to formally begin her campaign today at an event outside the Brooklyn Museum with her family and supporters, including Michael Gianaris, a powerful Democratic state senator from Queens known most for his successful efforts to disrupt Amazon’s deal for a headquarters in his borough.  — Emma G. Fitzsimmons There are 26 days until Election Day. Here are the schedules of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates for Thursday, Oct. 8. All times are Eastern time. President Trump No public events. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Afternoon: Greets Native American tribal leaders in Phoenix with his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris. 5 p.m.: Delivers remarks before leaving on a bus tour to meet with small business owners and voters in Phoenix and Tempe, Ariz.

Annamarie Eggert has voted in every presidential election since 1948, when she cast her ballot for Harry S. Truman. Now she is 94 and ailing, but determined to vote in this one, too. Mrs. Eggert, a Biden supporter from Maine, has expressive aphasia, a condition that has made it difficult for her to talk. “We — need — to get Trump out of there,” she said, each word painstakingly coaxed from her lips. “Come hell — or high water, I will — vote.” In this most contentious of elections, in which the very act of voting has come under fierce national debate, the determination of many very old, ill and infirm Americans to cast what could be their last vote is profound. Though aware that they might not live long enough to be affected by the results, they say they are voting for children, grandchildren and their future — a final act as Americans. “Most of my life at this point really is vicarious,” said Jill Haak Adels, 82, who has an aggressive form of cancer and a progressive lung condition that makes her increasingly short of breath. Yet she is making sure she will be able to vote, and intends to cast a straight Republican ballot. “The president we have now is just fine,” she said. “He’s done a lot of things that have been overdue for a long time.” Dr. Barry K. Baines, a physician who wrote a book on “ethical wills” — documents in which people pass along their values — noted that those in their late 80s and 90s belonged to the Greatest Generation, who grew up during World War II. “At its core, this was the most civic-minded generation,” he said. “If you’re an American, you vote because you have the freedom to vote. So that generation has a sense of how effective one person’s vote can be.” — Katie Hafner Mike Pence and Kamala Harris clashed on the coronavirus.
