Trump’s new coronavirus adviser has questioned masks and alarmed government scientists. Biden and Trump release dueling ads on public safety in swing states. A new Monmouth poll shows a tightening race in Pennsylvania. Biden shatters fund-raising records with $364.5 million haul in August. The presidential debates will be moderated by Chris Wallace, Steve Scully and Kristen Welker. Melania Trump reportedly used her personal email account for government business. Joseph R. Biden Jr., moving to refocus the campaign on the coronavirus pandemic after days of national attention on law enforcement matters, argued on Wednesday that President Trump was failing the nation’s parents, teachers and schoolchildren because of his mismanagement of the crisis. “President Trump still doesn’t have any real plan for how to open our schools safely,” Mr. Biden said in a short speech in Wilmington, Del., after receiving a briefing from a group of experts. “No real plan for how to help parents feel secure for their children. He’s offering nothing but failure and delusions. From the start to finish, the American families and our children are paying the price for his failures.” The Biden campaign said that Mr. Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, were urging Mr. Trump to work with congressional leaders to provide emergency funding for schools of at least $200 billion. “Mr. President, where are you?” Mr. Biden said. “Where are you? Why aren’t you working on this? We need emergency support funding for our schools and we need it now. Mr. President, that’s your job.” “Get off Twitter,” he added. If elected, Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris would direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to make available federal aid to K-12 schools to support their reopening and operations amid the crisis, the campaign said. Mr. Biden hit on similar themes in his address. Mr. Trump has demanded that schools reopen this fall and threatened to cut federal funding for school districts that defied his wishes. But his effort to pressure schools did not have the effect he desired, and many districts decided to begin the school year with remote instruction. Mr. Biden’s remarks came as the presidential race has been dominated in recent days by debates over racial injustice and protests. At their party convention last week, Republicans sought to paint Mr. Biden as radically anti-law enforcement, seizing on the unrest playing out in some American cities amid otherwise largely peaceful protests. The Biden campaign has long sought to make the race a referendum on Mr. Trump’s character and leadership, focusing in particular on his stewardship of the pandemic, and the speech on Wednesday represented an opportunity to put a spotlight on how Mr. Trump’s handling of the crisis was affecting the nation’s schools. In July, Mr. Biden released his own plan for safely reopening schools, which emphasized deference to local decision-making on whether and how schools could reopen in a safe manner. His plan also called for Congress to pass an emergency funding package to help enable schools to adapt for reopening. — Katie Glueck and Thomas Kaplan Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill Biden, will visit Kenosha, Wis., on Thursday, his campaign announced, a city reeling from the Aug. 23 police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake. The announcement came one day after President Trump visited Kenosha over the objections of Wisconsin’s governor and Kenosha’s mayor, both Democrats. During his visit, the president did not mention Mr. Blake, who was paralyzed in the shooting, or speak with his family. Two demonstrators who were protesting the shooting of Mr. Blake were killed in Kenosha last week, and a white teenager has been charged with homicide. Protests in Kenosha over Mr. Blake’s shooting have at times turned destructive, as buildings were burned and storefronts destroyed. Asked on Wednesday about his visit, Mr. Biden said “we’ve spoken to all the leaders up there” and added that “there’s been overwhelming requests that I do come.” “We’ve got to heal,” Mr. Biden told reporters in Wilmington, Del. “We’ve got to put things together, bring people together. And so, my purpose in going will be to do just that — to be a positive influence on what’s going on.” This week Mr. Trump declined to criticize the 17-year-old charged in the killings, Kyle Rittenhouse, who had attended one of his rallies earlier this year. “He probably would have been killed,” the president said. The Biden campaign said Mr. Biden would “hold a community meeting in Kenosha to bring together Americans to heal and address the challenges we face.” After that, he and Dr. Biden will make another stop in Kenosha. The campaign did not provide further details about its plans. The trip comes as Mr. Biden is ramping up his travel schedule in the final two months of the campaign, following a long stretch during the pandemic when he made only occasional in-person appearances and rarely strayed beyond Delaware and eastern Pennsylvania. On Monday, Mr. Biden gave a speech in Pittsburgh expressing support for protesters of racial injustice but vigorously denouncing demonstrations that have turned violent, his most forceful rebuke yet of Mr. Trump’s efforts to paint him as radically anti-law enforcement. “Rioting is not protesting,” Mr. Biden said. “Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It’s lawlessness, plain and simple. And those who do it should be prosecuted.” He has leaned into those themes since with an ad. Prior to that speech, some Biden allies had urged the campaign to address the subject head-on, and had expressed interest in seeing Mr. Biden travel more. — Katie Glueck and Thomas Kaplan President Trump has recently turned to a new adviser on the coronavirus: Dr. Scott W. Atlas, who has argued that the science of mask-wearing is uncertain, that children cannot pass on the coronavirus and that the role of the government is not to stamp out the virus but to protect its most vulnerable citizens. Ideas like these, both ideologically freighted and scientifically disputed, have propelled Dr. Atlas, a radiologist and senior fellow at Stanford University’s conservative Hoover Institution into President Trump’s White House, where he is pushing to reshape the administration’s response to the pandemic. Mr. Trump has embraced Dr. Atlas, as has Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, even as he upsets the balance of power within the White House coronavirus task force with ideas that top government doctors and scientists like Anthony S. Fauci, Deborah L. Birx and Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, find misguided — even dangerous — according to people familiar with the task force’s deliberations. Dr. Atlas is neither an epidemiologist nor an infectious disease expert, the two jobs usually associated with pandemic response. But his frequent appearances on the Fox News Channel and his ideological surety caught the president’s eye. The core of his appeal in the West Wing rests in his libertarian-style approach to disease management, akin to one used to disastrous effect in Sweden. The argument: Most people infected will not get seriously ill, and at some point, enough people will have antibodies to deprive the virus of carriers — “herd immunity.” His embrace of this, and other ideas,  has alienated his colleagues. “Trying to get to herd immunity other than with a vaccine isn’t a strategy. It’s a catastrophe,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, the former C.D.C. director. Dr. Atlas declined a request to be interviewed, but Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, accused the news media of trying to “distort and diminish” his beliefs and record, adding that the adviser “is working to carry out the president’s No. 1 priority: protecting the health and safety of the American people.” White House officials said there had never been an attempt to shift policy to anything resembling herd immunity.  — Noah Weiland, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Michael D. Shear and Jim Tankersley The Trump campaign released two ads Wednesday that it said would air in Minnesota and Wisconsin that aim to tie Joseph R. Biden Jr. to protests over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. “Lawless criminals terrorize Kenosha,” the Wisconsin ad states. “Joe Biden takes a knee.” The new Trump law-and-order spots came a day after the Biden campaign unveiled a 60-second ad that repackaged elements of the speech he gave Monday in Pittsburgh, condemning the violence that sprang from some protests against systemic racism in policing and accusing President Trump of fanning the flames of violence. Mr. Biden has regularly condemned the violence that has arisen from some protests, and accused Mr. Trump of stoking divisions. But Mr. Biden’s new ad, part of a pushback after speaker after speaker at the Republican National Convention tried to paint him as soft on lawlessness, often by misrepresenting his record and his policy positions, is the first time that he has put the issue of public safety into a major paid advertising program. The ads are part of a $45 million one-week television and digital purchase that is by far the campaign’s largest to date. (The Biden campaign announced a record-breaking $364.5 million August fund-raising haul, which is more than Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump raised combined in July.) The ad represents a shift for the Biden campaign. Since Mr. Biden first went on the airwaves in June, nearly 75 percent of the television ads that his campaign have run have focused on the coronavirus, according to an analysis by the media-tracking firm Advertising Analytics. Mr. Trump’s ads have been the inverse. Only 5 percent of them have focused on the virus compared to more than 60 percent that highlighted crime — a reflection of the Trump campaign’s determination to frame the election around the question of whether Mr. Biden would be able to keep people safe, rather than around the coronavirus crisis and Mr. Trump’s leadership over the last three and a half years.  — Shane Goldmacher, Maggie Haberman, Reid J. Epstein and Michael Cooper Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s lead over President Trump among registered voters in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania has shrunk from 13 percentage points to just four points, according to polling released Wednesday by Monmouth University. The narrowing is largely because Mr. Trump has begun consolidating support from Republicans and conservative voters who have disapproved of his stewardship, but it is also is due to declining support for Mr. Biden among men over all and among voters under age 50. Mr. Biden has led 36 of the last 37 public polls of Pennsylvania, a state Mr. Trump carried by 44,000 votes out of 6 million cast in 2016. Mr. Trump’s victory there, powered by a combination of stronger than expected support for him in the state’s rural areas and weak turnout in major cities, prompted a multi-year Democratic reckoning that the Scranton-born Mr. Biden and his allies are still struggling to process. The Monmouth poll also shows that a high turnout model narrowly benefits Mr. Biden. The Democratic nominee leads the race by three points when the poll assumes a high turnout, but by just one point if there is low turnout. Still, the poll found Mr. Biden retains healthy leads among the people most likely to vote. He is leading by 11 points among voters 65 and older, a demographic Mr. Trump carried by 10 points in 2016, according to exit polls. The poll also found Pennsylvania’s self-described independent voters are split evenly between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, with each taking 45 percent. — Reid J. Epstein Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced a $364.5 million haul of donations for August between his campaign and his shared committees with the Democratic Party, shattering past fund-rasing records. Small-dollar online donations accounted for more than $205 million of that sum and Democratic contributors poured money into Mr. Biden’s coffers, especially since the selection of Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. So many supporters bought Biden-Harris yard signs that the campaign had to open a new fulfillment center. Big contributors, from Silicon Valley to Wall Street, gave generously too, with checks that can be as large as $721,300. Mr. Biden’s sum laps what is believed to be the previous monthly record of $193 million, set by Barack Obama in September 2008, though there is no formal record-keeping. The $364.5 million is more than the sum of what Mr. Biden ($140 million) and President Trump ($165 million) raised in July. “That figure blows me away,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. The Biden campaign said that it now counts more than 4 million donors and that 1.5 million Americans gave for the first time in August. Just the portion that Mr. Biden raised online — $205 million — is more than any previous presidential candidate's full monthly total. And his total haul is more, for instance, than what Mr. Trump ($90 million) and Hillary Clinton ($143 million) raised in August 2016 — combined. The news comes as the general election enters an intense final two-month sprint following the conventions. Mr. Trump traveled to Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday, the site of unrest following the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake. The president has tried to cut into Mr. Biden’s polling lead by distorting Mr. Biden’s record on law enforcement and accusing the former vice president of being tolerant of violent mobs. Mr. Biden has forcefully rejected that characterization, and charged that it was the president who was making the country unsafe with divisive, inflammatory behavior. Both sides are ramping up television and digital ad buys, and Mr. Biden’s enormous haul ensures he will have the funds both to defend states that Mrs. Clinton carried in 2016 and to try to make incursions into Mr. Trump’s territory.The Biden campaign had previously announced that it raised $48 million in the first 48 hours after Ms. Harris was named as Mr. Biden’s vice-presidential choice and $70 million during the four-day Democratic convention. The Trump campaign has not announced its August fund-raising total but has said it raised $76 million during the Republican convention. — Shane Goldmacher The Commission on Presidential Debates has selected the moderators for the three debates between President Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.  this fall, as well as the single vice-presidential debate, the commission announced Wednesday. Chris Wallace, the “Fox News Sunday” anchor, will moderate the first debate on Sept. 29, to be held in Cleveland, the person said. The second debate, a town hall-style forum scheduled for Oct. 15 in Miami, will be moderated by Steve Scully of C-SPAN. And the final one, on Oct. 22 in Nashville, will be moderated by Kristen Welker of NBC. The vice-presidential debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris, Mr. Biden’s running mate, which is set for Oct. 7 in Salt Lake City, will be moderated by Susan Page of USA Today. The choices of moderators appeared to anger the Trump campaign, which had made a list of demands and named moderators it considers acceptable. “These are not the moderators we would have recommended if the campaign had been allowed to have any input,” said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign. “Some can be identified as clear opponents of President Trump, meaning Joe Biden will actually have a teammate on stage most of the time to help him excuse the radical, leftist agenda he is carrying.” Mr. Biden told reporters that he looked forward to debating Mr. Trump — and that he regretted that there would not be real-time fact checkers weighing in as they speak.  — Maggie Haberman President Trump’s advance team wanted to show him commiserating with the owners of a burned-out camera shop during his Tuesday visit to Kenosha, Wis. The only problem: the owners wanted nothing to do with Mr. Trump. So the White House did the next best thing — it found the store’s former owner, who still owns the building that housed it before it was destroyed, and passed him off as a business owner aggrieved by the city’s unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake. “I just feel that this is another photo op for him and I just didn’t want to be part of it,” said Tom Gram, a co-owner of Rode’s Camera Shop in Kenosha. “Just to have words put in my mouth or whatever, I just didn’t want that to happen.” Mr. Gram said in a Wednesday interview that he did not return a phone call from the White House advance team seeking to arrange for him to appear with Mr. Trump. But John Rode III, whose family started the business in 1911 and sold it to Mr. Gram and a partner in 2012, did show the building on Roosevelt Road, in Kenosha’s Uptown section, to the president and appeared at a round table discussion at a local high school. “John Rode III, owner of Rode’s Camera Shop,” Mr. Trump said while introducing Mr. Rode. “John, stand up, please.” Mr. Rode proceeded to thank Mr. Trump and local law enforcement for doing “an awesome job.” In an interview Wednesday, Mr. Rode said he did not hear Mr. Trump’s introduction at the time but watched a recording afterward. “He introduced me as the business owner and I didn’t correct him,” Mr. Rode said. “People say you shouldn’t correct him anyway.” Mr. Gram, 63, has known Mr. Rode for decades. He began working at the camera shop in 1979, on the day he graduated from Milwaukee Area Technical College, before buying the business in 2012. He said he has been inundated with press requests and hate mail since the discrepancy was first reported Tuesday night by WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee. “I’m a quiet person. I don’t like to get involved in politics,” he said. “I got my first hate email last night. It’s very difficult for me. I’ve had difficulty sleeping ever since the store was burned.” Mr. Rode, 68, said he remained undecided about whether to vote for Mr. Trump this November but the opportunity to interact with him was something he could not pass up. “I was not in any way trying to make it look like I owned the business,” Mr. Rode said. “I’ve only done what I thought was best for them. I feel like Tom has kind of stabbed me in the back a little bit.” Mr. Gram said he was no fan of Mr. Trump’s style and rhetoric, which he said dismissed the concerns of Kenoshans to make a broader political point in defense of police officers. “I’ve always felt safe in Kenosha,” he said. “He needs to look at the other side of the story too. We’re a community here and we need to heal and we need to grow. I feel that he is too divisive and just needs to work with us.” — Reid J. Epstein Melania Trump used a personal email account and encrypted messaging apps like Signal to conduct government business, a former friend and associate of the first lady told The Washington Post. Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who served as Mrs. Trump’s top aide and had previously been a close friend, told the newspaper in an interview that the two women did not use official White House email accounts when they communicated frequently about official topics. Ms. Wolkoff recently published a memoir, “Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady,” but the allegation about Mrs. Trump’s use of personal email accounts is not included in the book. The use of personal email accounts was at the heart of Donald Trump’s most vicious attacks on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign. He repeatedly accused her of having deleted 33,000 emails from a personal server while she was secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton said the emails were personal in nature, and an FB.I. investigation found no evidence that they were deleted deliberately. Ethics experts said that because Mrs. Trump is not a government employee, she is not automatically covered by the same laws that would govern communications by a cabinet secretary or other administration officials. But discussion of government business and information could still be violations. “It raises some legal questions that need to be looked at about whether any of the emails would trigger a provision of the Presidential Records Act,” which requires that communications be permanently preserved and archived, said Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group. Mr. Libowitz said that the use of personal accounts by the first lady also fits a broader pattern in which members of the Trump administration have sought to avoid transparency by using personal email accounts and messaging apps. Last year, the House Oversight Committee began investigating reports that Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, had been using WhatsApp, a popular encrypted messaging app, and personal email accounts to conduct business, including communications with foreign leaders. The president’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump, Mr. Kushner’s wife, also reportedly used personal email for government communications. A representative for her lawyer told reporters at the time that she occasionally used a personal account before she was briefed on the rules and that none of the communications were classified. White House officials and Ms. Wolkoff did not respond to requests for comment. The Post said that its reporters had reviewed emails and other messages that they described has having been from “private email and messaging accounts used by Melania Trump.” The paper said the topics in those messages included discussions of government hiring; schedules for Mr. Trump and the first lady during state visits; discussion about the first lady’s anti-bullying initiative; and inaugural finances. — Michael D. Shear Before a Black Lives Matter rally in his district on Tuesday, Representative Clay Higgins, Republican of Louisiana, threatened on Facebook to kill people who showed up armed and seemed to single out Black protesters. He posted a photo of a Black militia. “If this shows up,” he warned, “we just eliminate the threat.” He added, “we don’t care what color you are.” “I wouldn’t even spill my beer,” Mr. Higgins wrote. “I’d drop any 10 of you where you stand.” The congressman’s post inciting violence came as President Trump has been responding to nationwide demonstrations against police brutality by suggesting, in increasingly conspiratorial terms and without offering evidence, that armed agitators are being sent into American cities to cause disorder and bloodshed. The photo Mr. Higgins attached to his remarks was taken from a march in Louisville, Ky., where members of a Black militia protested the killing of Breonna Taylor. Facebook deleted Mr. Higgins’s post, according to the congressman, who wrote an update Tuesday standing by his original message and telling his followers: “I’ll advise when it’s time gear up, mount up, and roll out.” Mr. Higgins, a two-term member of Congress, posted the original message before a demonstration in Lafayette, La., on Tuesday protesting the killing of a Black man by the city’s police officers. Armed people did in fact show up at the protest, but they were white and part of the right-wing Louisiana Cajun Militia. A member identifying himself as a militia leader told a reporter they were there to protect the right of those attending to protest, but added, “We’re just not going to let them go around burning flags and intimidating.” Mr. Higgins did not kill them. Mr. Higgins, a former police officer known as the “Cajun John Wayne” who gained notoriety for viral anticrime videos, resigned from the force in Opelousas, near Lafayette, in 2007 after admitting to striking a suspect in handcuffs during the execution of a warrant and later giving false statements about the incident during an investigation, according to local reports. — Catie Edmondson As Iowa sees a spike in coronavirus cases, Joni Ernst, the state’s junior senator and a Republican in a tight race for re-election, echoed a debunked conspiracy theory that deaths were being greatly inflated and suggested that health care providers had a financial motive to falsify cases. Ms. Ernst said she was “so skeptical” of the government’s national statistics about virus fatalities, according to an account in The Courier newspaper of a campaign stop she made in Waterloo, a city of about 70,000. “They’re thinking there may be 10,000 or less deaths that were actually singularly Covid-19,” Ms. Ernst said. “I’m just really curious. It would be interesting to know that.” According to a tracking project by The New York Times, Iowa has had the most new virus cases per capita of any state over the last seven days. Ames and Iowa City, home to Iowa State University and the University of Iowa, rank second and fourth nationally among metro areas with the most cases per capita over the past two weeks. Ms. Ernst’s comments seemed to track a false claim spread by President Trump over the weekend, and removed by Twitter for violating disinformation rules, because it is linked to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. The claim, retweeted by Mr. Trump, inaccurately said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “quietly updated the Covid number to admit that only 6%” of deaths — or about 9,000 people — “actually died from Covid.” The claim was apparently based on a CDC data table updated last week showing 161,332 death certificates that listed Covid-19 as a cause of death. In 6 percent of cases, Covid-19 was the only cause of death. The other 94 percent included underlying conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes. On Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, made clear that just because a person had other health problems, or comorbidities, along with the coronavirus it does not mean that they did not die of Covid-19. “It’s not 9,000 deaths from Covid-19, it’s 180-plus-thousand deaths,” he said, adding that there should “not be any confusion about that.’’ On Monday, Ms. Ernst, who is fending off a stiff challenge from her Democratic opponent, Theresa Greenfield, also suggested doctors and hospitals had a financial incentive to inflate coronavirus statistics. “These health-care providers and others are reimbursed at a higher rate if Covid is tied to it, so what do you think they’re doing?” she told voters. — Trip Gabriel “Click on: antifa.com,” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted on Tuesday. “Tells you all you need to know.” The site redirects to Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign home page. But the switch is a prank, one that ties the Democratic presidential nominee to a largely online, far-left activist network to which President Trump has falsely sought to link Mr. Biden. Mr. Cruz’s tweet, which he deleted seven hours after posting, marked the latest and most high-profile effort from Trump supporters to baselessly connect Mr. Biden to Antifa, a loose collective of anti-fascist activists that opposes the president. The effort dates back several weeks, when right-wing influencers began tweeting about the website forwarding. On Aug. 12, Chanel Rion, a reporter with the far-right television network One America News, which has frequently trafficked in conspiracy theories, asked Mr. Trump about the redirect during a news conference. This led to more than 300 tweets repeating the misleading claim, according to Dataminr, a social media monitoring service. Charlie Kirk, a right-wing provocateur and the founder of Turning Point USA, tweeted Aug. 31 directing his followers to antifa.com to see “who is truly supportive of the domestic terrorism campaign slaughtering black people and destroying America.” The tweet was liked and shared over 10,000 times. And on Facebook, posts pushing the misleading claim have been shared tens of thousands of shares, according to CrowdTangle, which analyzes interactions across social networks. Anyone who owns a website can automatically send visitors to another website, without the second website having control. Indeed, after Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that he did not suffer “a series of mini-strokes,” someone purchased mini-strokes.com. It now redirects to Mr. Trump’s campaign site. Antifa.com actually directs to kamalaharris.com, which itself forwards users to joebiden.com. Records kept by the public domain registry Whois reveal little more, showing only that the domain’s owner is anonymous. It’s an open-ended question who controls the domain name. “Whoever owns antifa.com is redirecting it to our website as a troll,” Rob Flaherty, digital director for the Biden campaign, wrote on Twitter Monday. — Reid J. Epstein and Davey Alba Americans increasingly say that their rights to protest and dissent are threatened, according to a Pew Research Center poll released on Wednesday. But some Republicans view these rights as less important than they did just two years ago. Respondents to the national survey, which was conducted in late July and early August, were more likely to say that people’s right to peacefully protest was under threat than they were in a Pew poll from 2018. They also expressed a diminished level of confidence that the rights and freedoms of all people in the United States were protected. Americans of all partisan leanings were less likely than before to say that people could expect to have their rights protected, according to the new poll. Roughly six in 10 said that the statement, “the rights and freedoms of all people are protected,” did not accurately describe the situation in the country today. Even more stark was the rise in the share of Americans saying that people could not count on their right to peacefully protest: roughly four in 10 respondents doubted that people could count on that right, up by 13 points from 2018. The partisan divide on this question was particularly stark: While about four in five Republicans said they felt confident that people’s right to protest was safe, just 43 percent of Democrats said so. Republicans have become less concerned about protecting this right. Just 53 percent of Republicans said it was highly important that protesters be able to peacefully assemble, down from 64 percent two years ago. During a bitterly divided campaign season, Americans increasingly see the country’s political factions as living in alternate realities. A third of the country said that they flatly disagreed with the statement, “people agree on basic facts even though they disagree politically.” Another 38 percent said they disagreed somewhat with that statement. The new poll also found a slight dip in the share of Americans who said that it was highly important for leaders to use a respectful tone. Just 54 percent said this was very important, compared to 61 percent in 2018. While almost six in 10 Democrats said they valued a respectful tone, slightly less than half of Republicans did. The poll was conducted among 11,001 respondents using Pew’s American Trends Panel. The survey’s margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.5 percentage points. — Giovanni Russonello President Trump joked to Sarah Sanders, the former White House press secretary, about her “taking one for the team” after North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, winked at her during a summit in 2018, Ms. Sanders said. Ms. Sanders revealed the episode in her new book, “Speaking for Myself,” in which she discusses her time working for Mr. Trump, as well as how she may run for governor of her home state of Arkansas and her early days caring for young children. Throughout, Ms. Sanders writes glowingly about her former boss. Excerpts from the book, which goes on sale on Tuesday, were provided to The New York Times. Ms. Sanders describes the summit in Singapore between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim in detail, including a moment where she and the North Korean leader “made direct eye contact and Kim nodded and appeared to wink at me.” She described herself as stunned. On the trip back to Air Force One, Ms. Sanders relayed the encounter with Mr. Kim to Mr. Trump and the White House chief of staff at the time, John F. Kelly. The two men burst out laughing, Ms. Sanders writes. “Kim winked at you?” Mr. Trump asked, adding, “Are you telling me Kim Jong-un hit on you!?!?” Ms. Sanders made clear she didn’t mean that, but Mr. Trump and Mr. Kelly continued to joke about Mr. Kim’s intentions. “Well, Sarah, that settles it,” Ms. Sanders recalls the president joking. “You’re going to North Korea and taking one for the team! Your husband and kids will miss you, but you’ll be a hero to your country!”  — Maggie Haberman President Trump struggled to stay on message as he visited Kenosha.
