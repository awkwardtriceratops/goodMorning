Biden beat Trump in the ratings battle after the two appeared on rival network town halls. At a rally in Florida, Trump appears to confuse a G.O.P. congressman with a former aide. Climate change is on the agenda for the final Biden-Trump debate. 80 percent of election rulings by G.O.P.-appointed judges this year made voting harder, study says. Republicans still lead in Alaska, but it’s getting more competitive, a Times/Siena poll finds. Rupert Murdoch, the media titan, is said to be privately predicting a Biden victory. For nearly four years, congressional Republicans have ducked and dodged an unending stream of offensive statements and norm-shattering behavior from President Trump, ignoring his caustic and scattershot Twitter feed and penchant for flouting party orthodoxy and standing by quietly as he abandoned military allies, attacked American institutions and stirred up racist and nativist fears. But now, less than three weeks away from the election, facing grim polling numbers and a flood of Democratic money and enthusiasm that has imperiled their majority in the Senate, Republicans on Capitol Hill are beginning to publicly put distance between themselves and the president. The shift indicates that many Republicans, having concluded that Mr. Trump is heading for a loss in November, are grasping to save themselves and rushing to re-establish their reputations and political brand for a coming struggle for the G.O.P.’s identity. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska unloaded on Mr. Trump in a telephone town hall with constituents on Wednesday, eviscerating the president’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and accusing him of “flirting” with dictators and white supremacists and alienating voters so broadly that he might cause a “Republican blood bath” next month. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of the president’s most vocal allies, predicted that the president could very well lose the White House, and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas recently warned of a “Republican blood bath of Watergate proportions.” Even the normally taciturn Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has been more outspoken than usual about his differences with the president, rejecting the president’s calls to “go big” on a stimulus bill and divulging that he has been avoiding the White House for months because of the president’s refusal to put in place coronavirus precautions. “Voters are set to drive the ultimate wedge between Senate Republicans and Trump,” said Alex Conant, a former aide to Senator Marco Rubio and a former White House spokesman. “It’s a lot easier to get along when you’re winning elections and gaining power. But when you’re on the precipice of what could be a historic loss, there is less eagerness to just get along.” Republicans could very well hang onto both the White House and Senate, and Mr. Trump still has a firm grip on the party base. But the recent behavior of congressional Republicans has offered an answer to the long-pondered question of whether there was ever a point when Republicans might repudiate a president who so frequently said and did things that undermined their principles and message. The answer appears to be: the moment they believed he would threaten their own political survival. — Catie Edmondson  Television ratings matter to President Trump. So these numbers may sting. In a result that few in the TV and political arena predicted, Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s ABC town hall on Thursday night drew a larger audience than President Trump’s competing event on NBC, MSNBC and CNBC, according to Nielsen figures. Mr. Biden’s town hall, which aired on a single network, was seen by an average of 15.1 million viewers, compared to 13.5 million for Mr. Trump, Nielsen said — despite Mr. Trump’s event monopolizing three networks simultaneously. The town halls were vastly different television spectacles, befitting their respective protagonists. On NBC, Mr. Trump was darting and defiant as the “Today” host Savannah Guthrie pressed him to denounce QAnon and white supremacy (Mr. Trump hesitated on both) and clear up questions about his medical condition. On ABC, Mr. Biden and the moderator, George Stephanopoulos, engaged in a sober 90-minute policy discussion more akin to a PBS telecast. (Politico wrote that flipping back and forth between the two was like going from Bob Ross to “WrestleMania.”) NBC had drawn scorn for scheduling its Trump event at the same time as Mr. Biden’s previously-announced ABC forum, depriving viewers of the opportunity to watch both candidates. Executives at NBC News said it was a matter of fairness, saying they wanted the same conditions offered to Mr. Biden at his NBC town hall on Oct. 5. Critics, including the MSNBC star Rachel Maddow, suggested that NBC had erred in allowing Mr. Trump to appear at the same time as Mr. Biden. In the end, it appears that Mr. Biden did not need to worry. And the fact that the Democrat outdrew his voluble Republican rival is likely to launch dozens of hot takes about whether, after four seasons, Americans are simply growing bored with The Trump Show. — Michael M. Grynbaum and John Koblin Joseph R. Biden Jr. gave an impassioned pitch for the Affordable Care Act in Michigan on Friday, amplifying the message Democrats made at the Supreme Court hearings this week when they warned repeatedly that Republicans pose a direct threat to the health care law. Campaigning in Southfield, a predominantly Black suburb of Detroit, he spoke in highly personal terms about his late son Beau Biden’s own experience with the health care system while dying of brain cancer and vowed, “When I’m president I’ll take care of your health coverage the same way I would my own family.” Since the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Mr. Biden and Democrats in Washington have tried to tie the Supreme Court vacancy to the future of the Affordable Care Act, which the Trump administration is seeking to overturn in a case that will be heard by the court shortly after the election. During Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation hearings this week, many Democrats, including Senator Kamala Harris, Mr. Biden’s running mate and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, focused on the law, even displaying blown-up photographs of people who would suffer if the law is struck down. “He wants to get rid of Obamacare in its entirety,” Mr. Biden said during his speech on Friday, as he laced into President Trump for trying to overturn it. “With this nominee, he’s made that incredibly clear as well. Michigan deserves so much better.” During his speech, Mr. Biden also touted the Obama administration’s work to rescue the auto industry during the financial crisis. “We bet on autoworkers, we bet on the U.A.W., and they came through and it paid off,” he said to applause, in an effort to win back the union workers who flipped to Mr. Trump four years ago. And just days after a kidnapping plot was revealed against Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, who introduced Mr. Biden at the event, Mr. Biden laced into Mr. Trump for refusing to denounce a white supremacist organization on the debate stage two weeks ago. “There is no place for hate in America. Period. None,” Mr. Biden said. “It will not be tolerated.” Mr. Biden’s trip to Michigan — his third to the critical battleground in recent weeks — came a day before Mr. Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in Muskegon, on the state’s western shores. That Mr. Biden delivered his remarks in Southfield reflects the push his campaign is making  to engage Black voters, a crucial voting bloc for Democrats, who helped fuel former President Barack Obama’s victories in 2008 and 2012. The diminished enthusiasm among Black voters for Hillary Clinton in battleground states like Michigan — which Mr. Trump won by less than 11,000 votes — contributed to her loss in 2016, a warning sign for Democrats that looms over Mr. Biden’s campaign. The campaign announced on Friday that Mr. Obama would campaign on behalf of Mr. Biden in Philadelphia next Wednesday. — Sydney Ember  Rallying supporters in Ocala, Fla., on Friday afternoon, President Trump repeatedly appeared to refer to Representative Matt Gaetz, one of his most loyal supporters in Congress, as Rick Gates, a former Trump campaign aide who was a key witness in the Mueller investigation who was sentenced to jail last year for his part in a financial scheme. The president brought up “Rick Gates” during an apparently unscripted riff about Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat. Mr Trump said that he had been blamed when her husband was caught requesting to launch his boat over Memorial Day, when the state was under lock down. “It was Trump’s fault,” he said. “Can it ever be, like, Rick Gates’ fault?” At another point, Mr. Trump scanned the crowd, apparently looking for Mr. Gaetz. “Where is Rick? He’s here,” Mr. Trump said, before correcting himself and identifying Matt Gaetz as “one of our stars.” It was not clear if Mr. Trump was conflating the names of Senator Rick Scott and Mr. Gaetz, or if there was some other explanation for the gaffe. Mr. Trump routinely argues that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is mentally incapable of serving as president of the United States because of similar verbal blunders. Mr. Biden has misstated the location where he is campaigning, or what position he is running for (Mr. Biden last week misspoke and said he was running for Senate). During his remarks in Ocala, Mr. Trump also said he wasn’t just running against Mr. Biden. “We’re running against the left wing media, and we’re running against big tech,” he said. Later in the rally, Mr. Trump led the largely maskless crowd in what sounded like a half-hearted cheer of “We Want Hope,” referring to Hope Hicks, one of his closest advisers, who also tested positive for the coronavirus but this week returned to the campaign trail with him. Mr. Trump commended her quick recovery, apparently pulling her onto the stage in order to show another embodiment of an aide who was following his instructions of not letting Covid “dominate your life.” “We can share a microphone now!” Ms. Hicks exclaimed from the stage, where she appeared without a mask, quickly leaving, claiming she suffered from stage fright. — Annie Karni Judge Amy Coney Barrett is on a glide path to the Supreme Court, but she will leave behind a Senate badly torn by its third confirmation blowup in four years, with the potential for severe repercussions should Democrats take control next year. The decision by Senator Mitch McConnell and Republicans to push through Judge Barrett’s nomination to the high court on the eve of the election, after blocking President Barack Obama’s pick under similar circumstances in 2016, enraged many Democrats who saw it as a violation of Senate norms and customs. They were also coming under increased pressure from progressive activists demanding payback, in the form of an end to the legislative filibuster and an expansion in the size of federal courts should Joseph R. Biden Jr. triumph in the presidential race and Democrats take the Senate. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said it would be premature to discuss what Democrats might do if they won the Senate majority. But he did not dismiss the idea that changes could be in store should the party prevail, only to hit roadblocks erected by a Republican minority in 2021. “First we have to win the majority because if we don’t, all of it is moot,” he said in an interview after the confirmation hearing. “If we do, I’ve told my colleagues that everything is on the table if they jam through this nominee.” Democrats have been hesitant to discuss their plans should they gain power, not wanting to provide Republicans — who are playing defense around the country — with an issue that could alienate voters. Mr. Biden has pointedly declined to give his opinion on adding seats to the courts, but during a Thursday night town-hall-style interview on NBC, he said he was “open” to the idea depending on how Republicans handled Judge Barrett’s nomination. Yet even before the current fight, progressive groups were urging Democrats to be ready to ditch the filibuster, which allows the minority to block legislation by setting a 60-vote threshold for action. Activists — and some senators — say allowing the filibuster to remain in place if Democrats took control would hand minority Republicans the ability to block Mr. Biden’s agenda as they did Mr. Obama’s, maintaining the gridlock that has plagued Washington. Eliminating the 60-vote requirement would probably also be a prerequisite if Democrats decided to pursue enlarging the Supreme Court. — Carl Hulse President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. are scheduled to debate one more time before Election Day, and climate change is on the agenda. Kristen Welker of NBC News, moderator of the Oct. 22 debate in Nashville, revealed on Friday the six subjects that she plans to focus on during the 90-minute matchup: the coronavirus, national security, race, leadership and “American families,” according to an announcement by the Commission on Presidential Debates. She also included climate change, which was not initially listed as a topic for the debate in Cleveland last month, although the moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News, did end up asking questions about it. For now, the final debate is expected to be held in-person on the campus of Belmont University in Nashville. The debate commission has not yet decided whether to require independent virus tests for the candidates before they take the stage, according to a person familiar with its planning who requested anonymity to describe private talks. Mr. Trump has repeatedly refused to say if he took a test for the virus on the day of the Cleveland debate, claiming in a televised town hall on Thursday that he could not remember. The debate commission had asked each campaign to vouch for the health of their candidate before the event began; Mr. Trump tested positive for the virus two days later. The debate commission had also planned to revisit its rules and format following the unruly night in Cleveland, where Mr. Trump repeatedly interrupted Mr. Biden and Mr. Wallace. The commission has not yet made a decision on any rule changes, the person said. — Michael M. Grynbaum Progressive activists who want Democrats to expand the Supreme Court and pack it with additional liberal justices are mustering a new argument: Republican-appointed jurists, they say, keep using their power to make it harder for Americans to vote. Backed by a new study of how federal judges and justices have ruled in election-related cases this year, the activists argue that mainstream Democrats should view their idea as a justified way to restore and protect democracy, rather than as a radical and destabilizing escalation of partisan warfare over the judiciary. The study, the “Anti-Democracy Scorecard,” was commissioned by the group Take Back the Court, which supports expanding the judiciary. It identified 309 votes by judges and justices in 175 election-related decisions and found a partisan pattern: Republican appointees interpreted the law in a way that impeded ballot access 80 percent of the time, versus 37 percent for Democratic ones. The numbers were even more stark when limited to judges appointed by President Trump, who has had tremendous success at rapidly reshaping the judiciary. Of 60 rulings in election-related cases, 85 percent were “anti-democracy” according to the analysis. “There is a systematic pattern of Republican-appointed judges and justices tipping the scales in favor of the G.O.P. by making voting harder,” said Aaron Belkin, a political-science professor and the director of Take Back the Court. The rulings included numerous challenges to state-imposed limits on ballot access that have come under scrutiny in light of the pandemic, including requirements to obtain signatures from other people and deadlines and other limits on absentee or mail-in ballots. Mr. Belkin argued that the study results should be seen as part of a larger critique of how American democracy has become “rigged” in favor of conservatives, entrenching minority rule of the country. Even when Democrats enjoy majority support, they often lose elections, he said: The Electoral College in presidential races and the Senate’s structure disproportionately empower conservative-leaning voters in sparsely populated states. He called that an undemocratic advantage augmented by partisan gerrymandering of House districts and by Republicans’ increasing imposition of voting restrictions that tend to impede groups that lean Democratic. And conservative, Republican-appointed judges firmly control the judiciary. — Charlie Savage The reliably Republican state of Alaska has soured on President Trump’s job performance, but Republicans still lead the state’s races for president, Senate and the House, according to a poll released Friday by The New York Times and Siena College. Over all, Mr. Trump leads former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. 45 percent to 39 percent, with 8 percent supporting the Libertarian candidate, Jo Jorgensen. Forty-seven percent of Alaskans say they approve of how Mr. Trump is handling his job as president, while the same number disapprove. Dan Sullivan, the incumbent Republican senator, leads the Democratic nominee, Al Gross, by 45 to 37, with 10 percent backing the Alaska Independence candidate, John Howe. And in a rematch of 2018’s House race, the Republican Don Young, the longest-serving member of Congress, leads the Democratic nominee, Alyse Galvin, 49 percent to 41 percent. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 5.7 percentage points. Alaska has emerged as an unlikely battleground in the late stages of the campaign, as Democrats and Republicans have rushed to run advertisements in both the House and Senate races. The state has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1964, and Republicans enjoy a significant advantage in party registration and party identification, according to the survey. But many Alaskans have turned against Mr. Trump after backing him by 15 points against Hillary Clinton four years ago, creating a potential opening for the Democrats in a state with an independent streak. Many voters are backing a minor-party candidate, so there is an unusual amount of uncertainty. — Nate Cohn Rupert Murdoch, the media titan behind Fox News, The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal, has told several people that he thinks former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will beat President Trump in November, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Murdoch, known for speaking freely among associates and family members, has said on several occasions he thinks Mr. Biden is likely to win the presidency, the person said. He has used the word “landslide” in some instances. Mr. Murdoch prides himself on his ability to sniff out the electorate’s political mood, but in this case he sees Mr. Trump’s character flaws as his biggest Achilles heel. The polling data is the least of it, this person said. The Daily Beast first reported on Mr. Murdoch’s political prognostications. The Trump campaign had a different take. “The president is going to be re-elected,” said Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman. Mr. Murdoch supported Mr. Trump in 2016, and Fox News’s biggest prime time stars have been staunch defenders of Mr. Trump and his policies. A spokesman for Mr. Murdoch said he declined to comment. — Edmund Lee and Annie Karni In late summer, expecting a flood of absentee ballot requests, local election officials in 16 counties in Ohio and Pennsylvania contracted with a mailing company to handle them. But when it came time to print and ship the ballots, the private company, Midwest Direct, proved unable to handle the deluge. In Pennsylvania, for instance, nearly 30,000 ballots sent to voters in the county that includes Pittsburgh went to the wrong addresses. And several Ohio counties that expected absentee ballots printed by the company to land in voters’ mailboxes are now scrambling to print them themselves or figure out last-minute plans less than three weeks before Election Day. The Cleveland-based company’s inability to meet demand has underscored the stress that mail voting has put on the nation’s election process as the coronavirus pandemic curtails in-person voting — including in battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. Throughout the campaign, President Trump has loudly and baselessly claimed that mail-in voting is rife with fraud perpetrated by Democratic partisans. But the problems cropping up across the country with mail-in voting appear to be the result of overwhelmed systems, not intentional vote-rigging. And in this case, Midwest Direct is owned by supporters of Mr. Trump who until recently flew a Trump 2020 flag above the company’s headquarters. “We have freedom to vote for who we want and support who we want,” said one of the owners, Richard Gebbie. There is no evidence Midwest Direct has done anything improper with the ballots. Election security experts said there was little any vendor could do to tamper with the integrity of absentee ballots. But the company’s customers in government are seething. Local officials said Midwest Direct offered a variety of explanations for why the promised absentee ballots were slow to be delivered, from mechanical breakdowns to a higher volume of ballot requests than anticipated. In Lucas County, Ohio, which includes Toledo, Midwest Direct sent out 60,000 ballots more than a week late, and communicated little about the cause of delays, said Pete Gerken, a county commissioner. “We have lost nine to 10 days in the process and those days are not recoverable,” Mr. Gerken said. — Reid J. Epstein Senior lawyers for the Trump campaign set up a small law firm last year that is working for Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican House candidate in Georgia with a history of promoting QAnon, a pro-Trump conspiracy theory. While federal filings show that the firm, Elections L.L.C., principally collects fees from the president’s campaign and the Republican National Committee, it also does work for a number of congressional candidates, and none more so than Ms. Greene, underscoring the connections between QAnon and Mr. Trump and his inner circle. The latest example came Thursday night, when President Trump repeatedly declined to disavow QAnon at a televised town hall. Ms. Greene is one of several Republican candidates who openly espouse the collection of bogus and bizarre theories embraced by followers of QAnon, who have been labeled a potential domestic terror threat by the F.B.I. and who former President Barack Obama warned Wednesday were infiltrating the mainstream of the Republican Party. QAnon imagines, falsely, that a Satanic cabal of pedophile Democrats are plotting against Mr. Trump, plays on anti-Semitic tropes and stokes real world violence — and has been expounded on at length by Ms. Greene in videos. Elections L.L.C. was founded last year by Justin Clark, Mr. Trump’s deputy campaign manager, and Stefan Passantino, a former top ethics lawyer in the Trump White House. Matthew Morgan, the Trump campaign’s counsel, is also a partner at the firm. Ms. Greene’s campaign has made 14 payments to the firm since last year, worth nearly $70,000 in total, the most of any congressional campaign. Mr. Clark, Mr. Morgan and Mr. Passantino would not comment. In a statement, the Trump campaign said, “Elections L.L.C. is a law firm like many others that do campaign work. Just like any other law firm, its lawyers have clients that have no relationship to other lawyers of the firm or their clients.” The fact that a law firm with close ties to the White House is doing work for one of the most prominent proponents of QAnon shows how quickly the conspiracy theory has moved from the far-right fringe to the center of Republican politics, presenting a significant challenge to the party at a time when it is already being rejected by many moderate voters. — Danny Hakim On Thursday The Babylon Bee, a conservative Christian satire site, reported that Twitter had shut down its entire network to prevent users from sharing negative news about Joseph R. Biden Jr. This was, like everything else on The Bee, a joke, in this case a mash-up of two real-life events: Twitter had taken more limited action to restrict its users from sharing an unverified New York Post report about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter’s ties to a Ukrainian energy company,  sparking outrage on the right. And on Thursday evening, Twitter experienced widespread outages for over an hour. The fakeness of The Bee’s news, however, may have been lost on at least one reader. Early Friday morning, President Trump straight-facedly shared the story on Twitter. “Wow, this has never been done in history,” he wrote. “Why is Twitter doing this. Bringing more attention to Sleepy Joe.” Twitter Shuts Down Entire Network To Slow Spread Of Negative Biden News https://t.co/JPmjOrKPcr via @TheBabylonBee Wow, this has never been done in history. This includes his really bad interview last night. Why is Twitter doing this. Bringing more attention to Sleepy Joe & Big T Though Mr. Trump has occasionally retweeted stories from The Bee before, the site’s editors said recently they were confident the president was aware that their news isn’t real. “He does know it’s satire,” said Kyle Mann, The Bee’s editor in chief. “We are assured.” The piece offered fairly clear clues that it was, in fact, fictional, including a sentence in which Twitter’s C.E.O., Jack Dorsey, “smashed a glass box in his office reading, ‘Break In Case Of Bad Publicity For Democrats.’” Anyone wondering what The Bee would make of the president’s shout-out did not have to wait long. An hour later, The Bee tweeted: “President Trump Declares The Babylon Bee His Most-Trusted News Source.” — Emma Goldberg AD WATCH President Trump’s rude and demeaning comments to and about women are no secret. Just last week, he called Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, a “monster.” A new ad from the Lincoln Project urges voters to consider what it would be like to have a different kind of president — a man, it suggests, who actually respects women. The ad sharply contrasts Mr. Trump with Joseph R. Biden Jr., elevating Mr. Biden’s selection of Ms. Harris as his running mate as proof that he “doesn’t just value a female voice but chooses one to be his right-hand woman.” The 90-second ad opens with two directives: “Imagine a young girl looking in the mirror, searching for role models in the world to give her hope that one day she, too, can make a difference. Now imagine how she feels when she watches women being verbally attacked.” Cue a series of clips that show Mr. Trump belittling women, including female reporters. “Your daughters are listening,” the ad says. Then as the music soars, the ad encourages viewers to “imagine a different future for her” — one with Ms. Harris as Mr. Biden’s “right-hand woman.” It closes with a note of hope that doubles as a warning: “Your actions on Nov. 3 will define who she sees.” The ad does not cover the sharply divergent views both men — and both parties — have on issues that affect women, including women’s reproductive rights. Mr. Trump is known for his sexist remarks, and the clips the ad shows are real. Mr. Biden, on the other hand, has long styled himself a champion of women. He still refers to the Violence Against Women Act as his proudest legislative achievement and he said months before he selected Ms. Harris as his running mate that he would name a woman to his ticket. A slightly modified 60-second version of the ad is running nationally on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN, according to Advertising Analytics. It began airing on Thursday morning. The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, ran a similar ad four years ago. It did not work. And the Lincoln Project is a group of Never Trump Republicans founded almost exclusively by men, so this ad has a tone somewhat equivalent to when men stand up and say “as a father of daughters” to denounce bad behavior by other men. Still, the juxtaposition between the two candidates is powerful and likely to resonate with voters who are tired of Mr. Trump’s rhetoric. — Sydney Ember There are 18 days until Election Day. Here are the schedules of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates for Friday, Oct. 16. All times are Eastern time. President Trump 1:30 p.m.: Speaks about protecting older Americans in Fort Meyers, Fla. 4 p.m.: Holds a rally in Ocala, Fla. 7 p.m.: Holds a rally in Macon, Ga. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. 2:30 p.m.: Speaks in Southfield, Mich, on affordable health care. 4:30 p.m.: Meets virtually with faith leaders. 6:30 p.m.: Appears at a voter mobilization event in Detroit, Mich. Vice President Mike Pence 1:30 p.m.: Delivers remarks at a campaign event in Selma, N.C. Senator Kamala Harris Participates in a virtual event on finance; time T.B.D. In their televised town halls on Thursday night, President Trump continued his pattern of exaggerated, misleading and false statements on many topics, while former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. stuck closer to the facts. Mr. Trump continued to state without any factual basis that the coronavirus pandemic will end soon, and repeated his false statements that most people who wear masks get sick. He also dodged repeated questions about whether he had a negative coronavirus test immediately before the first presidential debate. The president’s characterizations of the economy’s performance under his administration were inflated, and he again claimed to have done more for African-Americans than any of his predecessors except for Lincoln, an assertion that historians say is not accurate. Mr. Biden got his numbers wrong on troop levels in Afghanistan relative to when he left office four years ago and mischaracterized an element of the Green New Deal, but generally avoided clear misstatements. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
