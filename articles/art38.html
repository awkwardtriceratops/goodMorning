Live Updates: Night 2 Will Feature Melania Trump, a Presidential Pardon and the Secretary of State in a Political Role<br></h1><p id="artcont">At the convention, Trump is expected to pardon a convicted bank robber who now helps former inmates. House opens an investigation into Pompeo’s convention speech from Israel. A do-over for Melania Trump, whose convention speech four years ago borrowed from Michelle Obama. Here’s how to watch the convention on Tuesday. TV networks protest after Fox News is granted extra access to convention sites. Ratings for the Republican Convention fall short of the Democrats’ first night last week. Trump says he will nominate Chad Wolf to be secretary of homeland security. A convention seafood battle looms as lobster waits in the wings to take on calamari. Melania Trump will speak from the Rose Garden of the White House tonight. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will endorse the president from a rooftop in Jerusalem. And President Trump appeared from the White House twice on the opening night of the Republican National Convention on Monday and plans to deliver his acceptance speech from the South Lawn. Their appearances amount to a radical break from tradition even for an administration that has repeatedly shattered longstanding norms. Never in recent times has a president used the majesty of the White House to stage a nominating convention, nor has a sitting secretary of state participated in such a partisan event, much less from overseas where he is ostensibly on a diplomatic mission. According to State Department guidance from December 2019, department employees are not allowed to “speak for or against a partisan candidate, political party or partisan political group at a convention, rally or similar gathering sponsored by such entities.” On Tuesday, a House foreign affairs subcommittee opened an investigation into Mr. Pompeo’s political activities during the diplomatic trip to Israel. The chairman of the subcommittee, Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, wrote in a letter to Stephen E. Biegun, the deputy secretary of state, that Mr. Pompeo’s speech could violate the Hatch Act, a Depression-era law that bars federal employees from engaging in political activities while they are on the job. “It is highly unusual, and likely unprecedented, for a sitting Secretary of State to speak at a partisan convention for either of the political parties,” Mr. Castro wrote in the letter. “It appears that it may also be illegal.” Mr. Castro asked the State Department to provide documents on the legal advice it received on the propriety of Mr. Pompeo’s speech, as well as an accounting of expenses from the trip. A State Department official had previously said that Mr. Pompeo would “address the convention in his personal capacity” and added: “No State Department resources will be used. Staff are not involved in preparing the remarks or in the arrangements for Secretary Pompeo’s appearance. The State Department will not bear any costs in conjunction with this appearance.” But the official guidelines, and a cable Mr. Pompeo himself recently sent to employees, state clearly that such partisan activities are prohibited even on employees’ personal time. In his letter, Mr. Castro said that based on guidance from the State Department and the Hatch Act, Mr. Pompeo was barred from participating in the convention. “It appears incontrovertible that the Secretary’s speech to the R.N.C. violates this prohibition,” Mr. Castro wrote. . — Peter Baker, Lara Jakes and Neil Vigdor Mike Pompeo is betting that he has more to gain, politically, than he will lose by breaking with diplomatic tradition on Tuesday night to become the first sitting secretary of state in at least 75 years to address a national party convention. The setting of the speech, with the lights of the Old City of Jerusalem expected to be visible over his shoulder, provides Mr. Pompeo with an opportunity to praise one of President Trump’s few foreign policy achievements that has received wide and bipartisan support: the normalization of diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. It also gives him a national platform with Mr. Trump’s core supporters — a political base that Mr. Pompeo is courting as he weighs a future presidential campaign. “If he has any interest in running for president in the future, this is a way of inserting himself into presidential politics, but at the cost of breaking an important tradition in American history,” said Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian. Mr. Pompeo has been under criticism since it became clear that he would be giving the speech while on an official diplomatic trip to the Middle East and North Africa. For nearly a year, Democrats in Congress have accused Mr. Pompeo of violating the federal Hatch Act by using taxpayer-funded government aircraft and hosting receptions at the State Department to further his political ambitions. Stuart Stevens, a Republican political consultant and former top strategist to Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign in 2012, said party loyalists “won’t care” whether Mr. Pompeo violated bans on engaging in partisan activities while traveling overseas on official business. The bigger problem for Mr. Pompeo, he said, is the prospect of a Republican Party so fractured after November that those who follow Mr. Trump will be unable to draw the widespread support needed to win the 2024 presidential election. On Tuesday morning, as he was flying across the Middle East, Mr. Pompeo offered a preview of his address. “President Trump has ensured the safety of America — and SECURED our many FREEDOMS, which is the cornerstone of this great nation,” Mr. Pompeo wrote from his personal Twitter account. — Lara Jakes “Her words.” That’s the message that aides to the first lady, Melania Trump, have underscored ahead of her headlining speech Tuesday night at the Republican National Convention. Mrs. Trump’s address, which will be delivered live from the newly renovated Rose Garden, will be “authentic,” written without the hidden hand of professional speechwriters. “Every word” of the address, Mrs. Trump’s chief of staff, Stephanie Grisham said, “is from her.” It’s a necessary rebuttal to Mrs. Trump’s disastrous appearance at the R.N.C. four years ago in Cleveland, where she had discarded a speech prepared for her by two prominent conservative speechwriters and instead ended up borrowing word-for-word phrases and themes from Michelle Obama’s speech at the Democratic convention eight years earlier. But for a first lady who for the past four years has chosen to be seen more than heard, sometimes letting her clothes (a jacket, most infamously) do the talking, a major speech in which she shares her own thoughts about her husband’s presidency is more than just an opportunity for a do-over. “We don’t hear from her often, so that means every time we do hear her speak, people are intently listening to what she has to say,” said Anita McBride, who served as chief of staff to the former first lady, Laura Bush. Mrs. Trump deserves credit, Mrs. McBride noted, for over the years subtly “getting her point across without poking the president in the eye.” While her husband was still promoting an anti-mask message from the White House, for instance, Mrs. Trump posted a portrait of herself wearing a face mask on Twitter, and encouraged Americans to wear face coverings and practice social distancing. — Annie Karni, Katie Rogers and Maggie Haberman The second night of the Republican National Convention is expected to include a pardon from President Trump for a man who robbed a bank in Nevada, according to two people briefed on the plan. The man, Jon Ponder, who received a separate state pardon this year, will be pardoned by Mr. Trump for his crimes, and the pardon will be a part of the formal convention program on Tuesday night, during which the theme is “Land of Opportunity,” the two people said. Mr. Ponder, who has since founded a nonprofit to help former inmates, was arrested for the bank robbery in 2004 by Richard Beasley, now a retired F.B.I. agent. Mr. Beasley is expected to speak at the convention as well. Mr. Trump hosted both men at the White House in 2018, for the National Day of Prayer. Mr. Ponder has three convictions; the other two are state charges related to domestic battery crimes in the 1990s and early 2000s. He was granted clemency for the domestic violence incidents this year. — Maggie Haberman The second night of the Republican National Convention will feature some big names, like Melania Trump, the first lady; Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. It will also include Nicholas Sandmann, the teenager involved in a confrontation with a Native American man at a protest last year, and Mary Ann Mendoza, a consultant to the We Build the Wall organization, which was recently accused of fraud. Here’s how to watch the convention and who else you can expect to see. How to watch: Convention proceedings will begin at 9 a.m. Eastern time Tuesday through Thursday but, as with the Democratic convention, the big speeches will happen at night. The Times will stream the convention every evening, accompanied by chat-based live analysis from our reporters and real-time highlights from the speeches. The official livestream will be available on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Twitch and Amazon Prime. ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News will cover the convention from 10 to 11 p.m. every night; CNN from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.; MSNBC from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.; PBS from 8 to 11 p.m.; and C-SPAN at 9 a.m. and then at 8:30 p.m. Who’s speaking: Mr. Trump’s campaign released a partial list of speakers for Tuesday: Former Attorney General Pam Bondi of Florida Attorney General Daniel Cameron of Kentucky Abby Johnson, an anti-abortion activist Jason Joyce, a lobsterman in Maine Myron Lizer, vice president of the Navajo Nation Mary Ann Mendoza, whose son was killed in a car crash with an undocumented immigrant Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez of Florida, the first Hispanic woman elected to that job Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky John Peterson, the owner of Schuette Metals in Rothschild, Wis. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa Nicholas Sandmann, a teenager from a Catholic high school in Kentucky Eric Trump, the president’s son and an executive vice president of the Trump Organization Melania Trump, the first lady Tiffany Trump, the president’s younger daughter — Maggie Astor Major television networks lodged a protest with Republican officials on Tuesday after the Trump campaign agreed to provide Fox News with additional access to major speeches at this week’s Republican National Convention. Representatives from rival networks — including ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN — cried foul in a conference call with Trump officials on Tuesday that grew heated at times, according to four people briefed on the discussion who were not authorized to speak about it publicly. The dispute emerged after the Fox News host Sean Hannity — a major ally of President Trump — revealed that he had received exclusive entry to key convention sites. “We’ll be broadcasting live from the Rose Garden in the lead-up for Melania Trump’s speech,” Mr. Hannity told viewers on Monday. “Wednesday, we’ll be at Fort McHenry where Vice President Pence will be, and on Thursday, we will be live on the South Lawn where President Trump will give his speech.” The other networks said it was unfair of the Trump campaign to grant Mr. Hannity and Fox News the additional access, which was expected to include a dedicated press riser and camera, and requested parity. Following the call, Trump campaign officials agreed to allow reporters from other networks into the Rose Garden for Mrs. Trump’s address, two of the people said, but the extent of that access was still being worked out. Because of safety restrictions relating to the coronavirus, the major TV broadcasters are reliant this week on a single, so-called pool feed of live video and audio from the Republicans’ events. (The same format was in place at last week’s Democratic National Convention.) In a typical year, the major networks would have built multimillion-dollar sets at the convention sites and arranged multiple anchor booths and camera stations throughout the arena floor. And it is not unusual for TV producers to lobby convention officials for unique access to significant events. But Mr. Hannity’s announcement caught rival networks off guard, given Mr. Hannity’s closeness with Mr. Trump and what other executives deemed overly favorable treatment for his network. The lead convention anchors for Fox News, Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, will host their Tuesday broadcast from the network’s regular setup for both of this year’s political conventions, at the United States Chamber of Commerce building in Washington.    The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. — Michael M. Grynbaum TV viewership for the first night of the Republican National Convention fell short of the Democrats’ first night last week, according to Nielsen. About 15.8 million people watched the Republicans live on Monday night between 10 and 11 p.m., down from roughly 19 million who tuned in for last Monday’s speeches by Senator Bernie Sanders and Michelle Obama. Almost half of that audience watched on Fox News, which brought in 7.1 million viewers — by far the biggest TV audience of the night. It was the network’s highest-rated opening-night convention audience in 24 years of broadcasting. Overall, the Republicans’ TV audience was down about 31 percent from its opening night in 2016. Last week, the Democrats saw a 25 percent decline in their opening night viewership. President Trump has a well-known fixation on television ratings, and he is sure to take note of the overnight figures. Aides to the president, who is a former reality TV star, hired two producers from his show “The Apprentice” to help oversee this year’s convention programming. The downward ratings trend for both political parties speaks to the growing number of Americans who watch live events online or on streaming platforms, as traditional TV subscriptions continue to fall, and to the difficulty of staging a convention during a pandemic without a large live audience and the chance of the unexpected. The Nielsen numbers do not include those streaming viewers, an audience that remains difficult to credibly measure. — Michael M. Grynbaum President Trump said on Tuesday that he would nominate Chad F. Wolf to be confirmed as the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, even after a government watchdog issued a report saying Mr. Wolf, currently the acting secretary of the department, was serving in his role illegally. “Chad has done an outstanding job and we greatly appreciate his service!” Mr. Trump said on Twitter. Mr. Wolf, the former chief of staff for former Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen M. Nielsen, has led the agency since November of last year after the resignation of his predecessor, Kevin McAleenan. The Homeland Security Department has not had a confirmed secretary since April of 2019, when Mr. Trump forced out Ms. Nielsen. At the time of Ms. Nielsen’s ouster, the Trump administration improperly reordered the department’s order of succession to install Mr. McAleenan, then the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, as the head of the department, the Government Accountability Office found earlier this month. The report found the subsequent moves involving Mr. Wolf and the acting deputy secretary of homeland security, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, were “also improper because they relied on an amended designation made by Mr. McAleenan.” But the government watchdog does not have the authority to enforce the findings on the administration. Mr. Wolf has also won praise from Mr. Trump in recent months with ongoing construction of the president’s border wall and aggressively defending the deployment of Homeland Security agents to mass demonstrations in Portland, Ore. The decision to send the agents has prompted accusations that Mr. Wolf has turned the agency into a tool that can be bent to the political whims of Mr. Trump. “I am honored to be nominated by President Trump to lead the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security in safeguarding the American people,” Mr. Wolf said in a statement. “As the Homeland faces evolving threats from natural disasters, violent opportunists, malign cyber actors, and transnational criminal organizations, the mission of DHS is as critical as ever.” — Zolan Kanno-Youngs Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former personal lawyer who implicated the president when he pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, is the focus a new super PAC ad repudiating Mr. Trump. Released this week by American Bridge, a liberal organization that has spent millions to oppose Mr. Trump, the ad is set to appear on television and online during the Republican convention this week, the group said. In the 1 minute 39 second ad, Mr. Cohen challenged Mr. Trump’s credibility and called his claims of upholding law and order “laughable.” “Virtually everyone who worked for his campaign has been convicted of a crime or is under indictment, myself included,” Mr. Cohen said. The ad comes just days after Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, was arrested on fraud charges related to a private fund-raising effort to build a border wall. The ad shows Mr. Bannon emerging from the Federal District Court in Manhattan last week after a brief arraignment. Mr. Bannon became the seventh Trump associate to have been charged with federal crimes since Mr. Trump took office, a list that includes Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager; Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser; and Mr. Cohen, whom Mr. Trump called a “rat.” Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to campaign finance violations and other crimes related to his role as a confidant of Mr. Trump. He admitted to arranging payments during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, to keep them from publicly discussing affairs they said they had engaged in with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison, from which he was furloughed in May because of the coronavirus pandemic. Probation officers sent him back to prison last month when he refused to sign a document that would have barred him from publishing a tell-all memoir about Mr. Trump. A judge later ruled that the action was retaliatory and ordered Mr. Cohen’s release. In the ad, Mr. Cohen said that anyone watching the Republican convention should not believe one word uttered by Mr. Trump. “So when the president gets in front of the cameras this week, remember that he thinks we’re all gullible, a bunch of fools,” Mr. Cohen said. “I was part of it and I fell for it. You don’t have to like me, but please, listen to me.” — Neil Vigdor It’s not just jobs, taxes and the coronavirus that the Republicans and the Democrats disagree on. The two parties are also poles apart when it comes to their representative seafood. Last week, Rhode Island calamari became a breakout star of the Democratic convention after a party official announced the state delegation’s votes for presidential nominee while standing beside a masked chef proffering a plate of fried squid rings — Rhode Island’s official state appetizer. Tonight at the Republican convention, it’s lobster’s turn in the spotlight. An eighth-generation Maine lobsterman, Jason Joyce, has a speaking spot, in which he is expected to laud President Trump’s trade and fisheries policies. Mr. Trump foreshadowed Mr. Joyce’s speech on Twitter Tuesday morning. “Beautiful Maine Lobsters will now move tariff-free to Europe! For first time in many years,” the president wrote. He was referring to an agreement that American and European trade officials reached last week in which the European Union eliminated tariffs on imports of American lobsters. Maine’s lobster landings decreased during the first three years of the Trump presidency, partly because of natural fluctuations but partly because of retaliatory tariffs that China imposed in 2018 as part of Mr. Trump’s trade war with China. This has been a dismal summer for Maine lobstermen, as the tourism trade that they rely on has been crushed by the coronavirus. — Andy Newman President Trump has long resisted criticizing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey — despite the authoritarian leader’s detention of American citizens and diplomatic employees, offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters in Syria and crackdown on protesters in Washington. And hours after the Republican convention aired an interview on Monday in which Mr. Trump called Mr. Erdogan “very good,” the State Department issued a statement denouncing Mr. Erdogan’s recent meeting with leaders of the Palestinian resistance group Hamas, highlighting the disconnect between Mr. Trump and the rest of his administration’s policy toward Turkey. The statement, from the State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus, said the United States “strongly objects” to a meeting that Mr. Erdogan hosted with two Hamas leaders in Istanbul on Saturday. The U.S. has designated Hamas a terrorist organization, and Ms. Ortagus said the leaders Mr. Erdogan met have been specifically designated global terrorists. “President Erdogan’s continued outreach to this terrorist organization only serves to isolate Turkey from the international community, harms the interests of the Palestinian people, and undercuts global efforts to prevent terrorist attacks launched from Gaza,” Ms. Ortagus wrote. She said it was the second time that Mr. Erdogan had invited Hamas leaders to Turkey this year. Contrast that with Mr. Trump’s comments in the convention segment: “I have to say that, to me, President Erdogan was very good,” he told the Rev. Andrew Brunson, who was detained in Turkey for two years until negotiators were able to convince Mr. Erdogan to release him in 2018. “So,” Mr. Trump said, “we appreciate that.” — Lara Jakes — President Trump, in a taped conversation with frontline workers shown at the convention. While reports of new cases have dropped considerably since late July, when the country averaged well over 60,000 per day, case numbers remain persistently high, according to a New York Times database, and there is no evidence that the virus is going away anytime soon. On Monday, more than 40,000 new coronavirus cases and at least 500 new coronavirus-related deaths were reported in the United States. With more than 5.7 million people infected, the United States leads the world in coronavirus cases — roughly 2 million more than the country with the second highest count, Brazil. — President Trump, speaking after he was renominated on Monday. While it is true that the labor market has regained more than 9 million jobs since April, that rebound came on the heels of an even larger decline — and about 60 percent of the jobs lost since February have yet to return. The rapid labor market bounce back has come as many people who had lost jobs temporarily during state lockdowns returned to work. It is difficult to judge at this point how robust the rebound will prove going forward. — President Trump, speaking after he was renominated. Mr. Trump has channeled substantial government funds to farmers who were hurt when China, one of the world’s biggest agricultural markets, imposed tariffs on American products during the U.S.-China trade war. The Trump administration announced a total of $28 billion in aid for farmers in 2018 and 2019, then secured another $23.5 billion to help American farmers through the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package passed in March. The administration says that these funds come from the revenue raised by the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed on more than $360 billion of Chinese goods. To date, the U.S. government has collected more than $60 billion of revenue from the tariffs Mr. Trump levied on Chinese bicycles, seafood, buttons, chemicals and many other goods. But Mr. Trump’s frequent claim that the tariffs are paid for solely by China is wrong. Whether the Chinese manufacturer, American importer or another company ultimately pays the cost of any particular tariff varies from product to product, depending on the ability of each party to negotiate. But overall, recent economic research suggests that the burden of the tariffs has fallen heavily on American firms, and that American manufacturers and consumers have ended up paying a substantial portion of the tariffs. — Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Jeanna Smialek and Ana Swanson TRANSCRIPT “Democrats started their convention last week with Eva Longoria, a famous Hollywood actress who played a housewife on TV. Well, I’m actually a real housewife and a mom from Michigan with two wonderful kids in public school who happens to be the only — only the second woman in 164 years to run the Republican Party. Four years ago, President Trump started a movement unlike any other. And over the next four days, we will hear from a few of the millions of hardworking everyday Americans who have benefited from his leadership.” “Florida —” “Georgia —” “Guam —” “Indiana —” “Iowa —” “Kansas —” “Kentucky —” “Tennessee —” “Texas!” “— are excited to nominate —” “— Donald J. Trump —” “— and Vice President Mike Pence —” ”— for four more years.” “Thank you for all you’ve done.” “He’s taken on the swamp, all of the swamp — the Democrats, the press and the Never Trumpers. And when you take on the swamp, the swamp fights back.” “This election is a battle for the soul of America. Your choice is clear: Do you support the cancel culture, the cosmopolitan elites of Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden, who blame America first? Do you think America is to blame? Or do you believe in American greatness? Ladies and gentlemen, leaders and fighters for freedom and liberty and the American dream, the best is yet to come!” “I am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants. They came to America and settled in a small Southern town. My father wore a turban. My mother wore a sari. I was a brown girl in a black and white world. We faced discrimination and hardship, but my parents never gave in to grievance and hate. My mom built a successful business. My dad taught 30 years at a historically black college. And the people of South Carolina chose me as their first minority and first female governor. America is a story that’s a work in progress. Now is the time to build on that progress and make America even freer, fairer and better for everyone. That’s why it’s so tragic to see so much of the Democratic Party turning a blind eye towards riots and rage. The American people know we can do better. America isn’t perfect, but the principles we hold dear are perfect. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that even on our worst day we are blessed to live in America.” “Our founders believed there was nothing more important than protecting our God-given right to think for ourselves. Now the left, they’re trying to cancel all of those founders. They don’t seem to understand this important principle: In order to improve in the future, we must learn from our past, not erase it. So we’re not going to tear down monuments and forget the people who built our great nation. Instead, we will learn from our past so we don’t repeat any mistakes.” “We don’t give in to cancel culture or the radical and factually baseless belief that things are worse today than in the 1860s or the 1960s. We have work to do. But I believe in the goodness of America, the promise that all men and all women are created equal. Our side is working on policy while Joe Biden’s radical Democrats are trying to permanently transform what it means to be an American. Make no mistake: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want a cultural revolution, a fundamentally different America. If we let them, they will turn our country into a socialist utopia. And history has taught us that path only leads to pain and misery, especially for hard-working people hoping to rise. Instead, we must focus on the promise of the American journey.” President Trump and his advisers had talked up how they planned to present a sunny, uplifting and optimistic vision of America at this week’s Republican National Convention, but the first day of festivities was filled with brooding warnings of a dark Democratic future. “Anarchists” would rule. Democrats would “abolish the suburbs.” There would be “rioting, looting and vandalism.” “Socialism” and “radicals.” “Cancel culture” run amok. “Woketopians” on the move. A “horror movie.” Such divisive language was hardly a surprise at the renomination convention of a president who declared at his inauguration an end to “American carnage” and whose political calling card from the start has been amplifying and maximizing the grievances of his supporters. But the explicit play to rev up Mr. Trump’s political base — from the list of speakers itself to their provocations from their various speaking perches — was a reminder of the narrow path he is pursuing as he seeks re-election. Suburban voters, especially white women who were essential to his surprise 2016 victory, have shifted decisively in the direction of the Democrats in the intervening years. There were some efforts to show a softer side of Mr. Trump who “cares” — a buzzword that was used repeatedly — and to justify as purposeful his general bombast. “Everyone knows he can be tough,” said Ronna McDaniel, the Republican Party chairwoman. “Some people don’t like his style,” noted the retired football player Herschel Walker. “President Trump sometimes raises his voice — and a ruckus,” said Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida. The explicit division on Monday of America into “Democrat states,” as Donald Trump Jr. put it at one point, and the rest of the country stood in stark contrast to the promises last week by Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee. Mr. Biden pledged to work as hard for those who vote for him as those who don’t. He said in his speech, “That’s the job of a president: to represent all of us, not just our base or our party.” — Shane Goldmacher Republican convention speakers mounted a revisionist defense of President Trump’s record, and the party embraced the grievances of his base.
