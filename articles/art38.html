Hi. How you doing? Good. How are you? Good. I just saw Fox News picked up my Hillary interview. So I’m tweeting, going, thanks for listening, Fox News. Oh my god, Fox News. Fox News. Ugh. Ugh. God. Anyway. How you doing. Are you OK? Is it early? Where are you? New York? Yeah I mean — Sarah Cooper is an author, comedian, and recently became a Netflix star. But right now, she’s wandering around an empty WeWork, trying to find a quiet place to talk to me. Is everything OK? No. It’s a real struggle. Yeah, it’s like a washing machine. There’s, like, street noise. Oh. It sounds like a jackhammer. Oh, all right. This should be quieter. Is there still kombucha there? No. On tap? There’s not even coffee on this floor. Like, that’s how dead it is here. OK. [LAUGHTER] OK. Good. Cooper went viral in April for her TikTok videos lip syncing Donald Trump. We were under lockdown. And the president, well, he was off his rocker — — And then I see disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute, and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it’d be interesting to check that. When Trump became Cooper’s muse, she mouthed his words from her living room with props like Flintstone vitamins and Kaboom bathroom cleaner. Watching his words come out of her mouth was horrifying. But it was also hilarious. [MUSIC PLAYING] So you’re famous for skewering Trump. You found fans in Jerry Seinfeld and Maya Rudolph, who is producing your Netflix special with you right now. But before you spent all this time, you had a long stint on Google. So most people don’t know about that. Yeah, it’s weird. I just got a text message from Ramy Youssef. It’s like, I didn’t know you worked on Google Docs. I love Google Docs. Yeah, I have some questions about Google Docs in a second. But go ahead. I was a designer on Google Docs. And my first product was Google Slides. Actually, I was the lead designer on Google Slides. And then I became the manager of the team that designs all of Google Docs, Sheets, Slides. And now I’m a user, an avid user. So how did you get there? Explain to people how you got to Google. Google was my fallback career. It was my plan B. I was trying to do standup comedy. I was trying to do acting. I moved from Atlanta to New York to pursue that. And it just got really expensive to be here. So a former colleague of mine who I went to school with at Georgia Tech was working here in Chelsea at the Google offices here and recommended me for a job there. I applied for a design position. They offered me a job. And I felt like I was kind of giving up a dream when they offered me the job. But I couldn’t say no. Right. Were you a designer by training? Yeah, so I went to Georgia Tech for digital design. I got my master’s degree in what was called information design back then, but it’s called digital design now. Yeah, so — and I was a designer for a long time. I worked at Yahoo on Yahoo Travel for a while. I worked on Flickr, took a break, and then went broke, and then went back to Google, and then left Google six years ago. So when you — at Yahoo Travel, what did you design? The home page, the Yahoo Travel home page, the personalization, the top 10 places you might want to go and all that stuff. [LAUGHS] And did you like it? Did you like doing it? I did. I mean, you know, I always thought that everybody liked being on the computer. But I went into a coffee shop once, and I saw somebody just on the computer, just pissed. They just had this pissed look on their face. And not everyone likes to be on a laptop. And I can just — I can be at a desk. It’s taken me a while to admit it because I don’t think it’s cool. But I feel very comfortable in an office space. And so what did you do for Google Docs? We have a lot of questions about Google Docs? Why am I an anonymous hippo, for example? Why is that? OK. So this was a fun thing. And it’s been around so long. And it’s kind of like when you go into a document and we don’t — you’re anonymized, we don’t recognize you, or you haven’t signed in — That’s — I never sign into Google. — we assign animals. We assign animals with a color so that you can still see that you’re in the document, and you can see that there are other animals there. So it’s just a fun thing. Do you not like it? Kara, do not like fun? Do you not like having fun when you’re — I don’t like fun. OK. I don’t like having fun in Google Docs. Go ahead. I will let them know, Kara. Thank you. I will let them know. That’s all right. I send little notes to them all the time. There you go. Sundar. I’m sure you do. Sundar. [LAUGHTER] Anyway — Oh my god. Do you really send notes to Sundar about — Yes, I do. Oh my god. Yes, I do. Poor Sundar. Why wouldn’t I? And Susan. I was mad about something on YouTube. I sent it to Susan and my kids. Yeah. [LAUGHS] I have their emails. I might as well go to the top. Oh my god. But when you — so you’re trying to have fun in a Google Doc. That’s what your design thing was. Yeah. [LAUGHS] And it was interesting. You still say “we” when talking about Google. Do you feel like you’re still part of it? There’s a whole Google ethos. Because I was married to an ex-Google executive. I did not know that. Yeah. And so I know a lot about especially early Google. How do you look at that time of working there? I feel so fortunate because it wasn’t the main campus. The New York office, and especially, Google Docs felt like a real family. The trip where I met my husband was a five-day offsite to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Oh, OK. They love those. Google loves those. Yes. And yeah, we were all sitting there, like, ugh, this private beach is not the best, or whatever. You know? That’s so Google. We were just like — Wearing head to toe Google swag, right? [LAUGHS] Complaining about the chairs. They had Google umbrellas. Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah, getting our drinks served to us. And yeah, that’s where I met my husband. I mean, it was just like a small family. So one of the things you did is wrote a book about office politics and things like that. It was called “How to Be Successful Without Hurting Men’s Feelings,” which is your time in the office. I’ve always been the kind of person who just observes people. And I didn’t really pay attention to it before. But even when I was at Yahoo, and sitting in a meeting, and I saw someone translate percentages into fractions, and I wrote it down. I was like, this is how you look smart in a meeting. You translate— so I was always just kind of observing people. Explain that for people who don’t understand. Oh, well, yeah, no. Somebody said, 25% of people clicked on this button, and then someone was just like, oh, about 1 in 4, interesting. [LAUGHS] It didn’t add any information. It just kind of like put it in a new spin. And everybody was like, oh, yea, 1 in 4. Thank you so much for crystallizing that for us. You know? You made it so much clearer. And it’s just so stupid. I wrote that down immediately. And I think because the corporate world is so sort of passive-aggressive, you can get away with saying absolutely nothing, and everyone’s just sort of like nodding around you. And it’s not unlike what happens with Trump and the people just agreeing with him because he’s the president. Give me some other examples that you saw. Because the book is very funny. And you had illustrations and everything. Yeah. So number one, draw a Venn diagram. It doesn’t even matter what it says. People are just like, wow, that’s a really awesome graphic. Pace around the room is one of my favorite because you don’t even have to say anything. But if you just get up and pace, people think that you’re — Larry Page does that. Yeah. The founder of Google does that rather a lot. Yeah. My favorite is interrupt someone and then let them finish, which is called the Kanye. So somebody is giving their update. And you can be like, I’m so sorry, Jim, I’m just going to stop you right there. Everyone, Jim’s update’s really important. So if everyone can just pay attention. OK, go ahead, Jim. You know? [LAUGHTER] It just makes you look like you’re totally in charge. That’s true. So Google’s not very funny right now. It’s in the news. Do you have any thoughts about the antitrust? Or do you— your husband still works there so perhaps you don’t want to comment on it. But what do you think when you see that? You worked for a company that felt like family, and now, of course, the government is going after it. And you know this has been a long time brewing here. Yeah. I — yeah, I’m still on the health insurance, so I don’t want to say anything. But you know — Well, what about big tech in general? Yeah. I mean, I would say they do have a lot of power. And you know, it’s weird because I have this thing of like, yeah, Google does have a monopoly sort of on Search. But it’s because it’s the best search. I do think there should be more competition. But at the same time, I think they build a really good product. Although I think competition would make Google better. I think that it would actually improve if there were people that were actually nipping at their heels versus what they have now, which is just — and that’s why you’ll get results that feel like most of the first page is ads. And that’s not a good user experience. So I do feel that government needs to get involved and start regulating some of this stuff because these things have hurt us. Facebook, Twitter, all of this has hurt humanity. We’re so addicted to it. And it’s so bad for us, you know? Talk about leaving Google. You decided — here, you have a really good job. You did your comedy on the side, writing a book. How did you decide to move on from that? I’d been a manager for about a year and a half. And when you become a manager, you stop doing things. You just start being in meetings all the time. And so I feel like part of it was just that I need to feel creative, and I just didn’t feel creative. And then, when you become a manager, you have to be a cheerleader. You have to get the team excited, like this is the best thing that we could all be doing with our time. And if you don’t actually feel that way, you can kind of feel like you’re living a double life. And that’s kind of how I started to feel, especially when millions of people were reading “10 Tricks to Appear Smart in Meetings.” And I wanted to just write more stuff like that. I just wanted to keep doing that. And I really started to — my attention started to just not be towards what I was doing. And I just felt bad about that. But I could have done both. And even my — he was my fiancé at the time. He was like, Sarah, do you really want to leave? Because when I see you at work, you look happy. And I was happy. I just was in meetings, thinking about other things. Even when I finally decided to say goodbye to Google, I had a panic attack. I thought that I was leaving too quickly. I didn’t have a book deal. That was — my manager’s first question was just like, you’re leaving to write, but you don’t have a book deal? And I was like, oh, I guess I should get one of those. But he said I could always come back, you know? And so hearing that, I was just like, well, if I can always come back, how much of a risk is it really? Mm-hmm. Yeah, that’s 100% correct. Plus, you could work at Facebook if you really needed to. Oh god, no. I want to work at a real tech company. [LAUGHS] What? You don’t think it’s a real tech company? (LAUGHING) No. I do not. Why is that? It’s built on psychology. That whole company is built on psychology. And it’s just manipulative. And I don’t know. It’s just scary to me. Yeah. Yeah. Well, there’s a lot of design things going in there. That’s why. Design is a critical part of it of how you push that button, which I think you worked on. How do you get people to use enjoyable use things? Yeah I mean, and that — when I was studying at Georgia Tech, that was the question is, how do you make something addictive? We were trying to make addictive things. Then you want people to — you want it to be sticky. You want people to spend all their time there. That’s a data point that people are like, oh, someone spent four hours on our app. This is great. And then it’s like, no, actually, that’s bad for that person. [LAUGHS] Right. How do you get people addicted? What are the tricks that maybe people don’t know about? Well, it’s interesting. But if you make — anything that feels personalized to you makes you feel special. So I mean, Facebook has nailed it. It says, good morning, Sarah. And it’s like, tell people what you’re doing. And it makes you feel important. It makes you— and then the likes come in, and then that makes you feel like, oh, people are seeing me. I mean, it’s Dale Carnegie, “How to Win Friends and Influence People.” Every single one of those things was used in this app because it says your name over and over again. It makes you feel like people are watching you. That’s the type of stuff that people can’t get enough of. Was their design tricks that you could do to do that? A lot of it is text because that is — some people love the color blue, but some people hate the color blue. But if you say “Sarah” in big letters, and it’s my name, I’m going to read that and be like, oh, it’s talking to me. You know what I mean? So I think that’s a big thing. And then all of the little fun little animations you see, like when you click the heart, and you see it expand and fade away, that makes you feel good, like you did something. Anything that makes you feel like you’re doing something. Did you ever feel bad about that? Because there’s a lot of people who left who were design focused. Did you ever feel bad about what you were doing? I mean, I feel — not at Google because I was working on something that helped people be productive. And so that was cool. But when I hear — my mom has unfriended family members over what’s going on. And she’ll just scroll Facebook and kind of like — I don’t know — feel jealous of people, and feel like she’s missing out on things. And it’s— watching her do that, that is like — that’s not good. Those aren’t good feelings. And so feeling like I helped part of that system create these experiences, yeah, that makes me feel bad. And the notifications, and she’s just getting an email. She doesn’t know how to turn it off. She gets an email every single time anybody likes anything or sees anything. Why? That’s not important. People have taken this thing, and they’ve made it so important in their lives. So you, yourself, have used tech to further your career. So let’s talk about how you did that. You went viral in April for your Donald Trump lip syncs on TikTok. I want you to walk through why you decided to do TikTok. You were doing it to keep you sane during quarantine. Now, people had done Donald Trump lip syncs. So you talk about the process and then why you think it took off the way it did. Yeah, I mean, I was just playing around with TikTok. And I’ve always liked lip syncing. But I never made a big deal about it. When I was little, I lip synced songs all the time because I wanted to be a singer. And I found a Donald Trump clip quote. And I just lip synced it because I kind of wanted to be like one of those guys in the meetings who’s just saying absolutely nothing, but everybody thought I was the best. And I think the thing that flipped it was, when you do an impression of someone like Donald Trump, you put on the makeup, you do the hair, you have the tie, you do all of those things to be — that’s an impression. You be as much like him as possible. I went the other way. I was like, I’m not trying to be him. I’m trying to say, what if he was me? You know what I mean? What if I could just embody that absolute confidence, despite the fact that I sound like an idiot? And I think— when people write me, they’re like, I’m so glad I get to hear what he’s saying without seeing him. Without seeing the physicality. I don’t want to see him. What was the first quote you used? The first quote was, “I’m going to form a committee.” We’re going to have a few committees. I’ll call them committees. “And we’re going to make decisions. And we’re going to make decisions fairly quickly. And I think they’re going to be the right decisions.” So saying nothing. Absolutely nothing, but in a way that it made it sound like he invented the concept of committee. So is that why you chose it? ‘Cause this is a thing you had written about before, these kind of meaningless meeting speak. Yes. That was exactly it. When I heard it, and you’re seeing him say this, and you’re seeing people behind him go, yep— was this committee ever formed? No. You know what I mean? [LAUGHTER] Maybe you were glad it wasn’t formed actually, honestly. Why did you think this would stick? Did you have a feeling about it at the time? I didn’t. I mean, I shared a few clips. And people were like, oh, this is funny. I got a little bit of traction but not much, and wasn’t going to do any more because other people had started to do it. Yeah, there was a whole trend on TikTok. Yeah. You had just come to TikTok, right? You had not — you had been a Twitter person, as I recall. Exactly. Yeah, mainly all Twitter. And I was like, this isn’t even original anymore. So I don’t think I’m going to do it. But then he did the Lysol and the UV light. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, you can — which you can do, either through the skin or in some other way. I heard it. And I just saw the whole thing in my mind. It sounds interesting. We’ll get the right folks equipment. And then I see the disinfectant. I saw the props. I saw me as the other character, going, what are you talking about? And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or — I saw it. And so I just had to do it. Even though I had decided to stop doing them, I just had to do it. And I’m glad I did. So talk about that creative process. You heard it, and it struck you just ‘cause it was so strange. What did you see? I just — I closed my eyes, and I saw — you know, I saw, “we can inject it into the veins.” I saw UV light in some other way. I think he says something in some other way. And I saw me, like, what other way would it be? And he was like, you’re going to check on that, right? And I just saw being the other person, being like, check on what? You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. So I think it was just — I just saw it all in my head. And that’s what made me — and that’s a similar process to what I do. If I hear a clip and it becomes activated in my mind — I can see it visually — that makes me want to do it. So you have to see it visually. And so you picked TikTok over Twitter, why? Well, TikTok is really easy to take audio, and lip sync it, and create video to it. I mean, it’s just a really good, efficient tool for that. And that’s the only reason why I was using it. I was taking those videos and putting them on Twitter. And that’s where they were going viral because Twitter is so much more about news and what’s going on now. And this had news, what’s going on now, and comedy, and politics, and everything kind of wrapped up in one thing. So of course, it was going to go viral on Twitter. But TikTok is a great tool. It’s a great editing tool. So yeah, you just take the phone. And you’re just recording yourself. And it’s very sequential and chronological. So you record this bit, then this bit, then this bit. And after 60 seconds, you’re done. Right. And so you did this — you do these in 60 seconds. They’re that quick. Well, no, I mean — to make a 60-second one, it takes me two to five hours to do. Two to five hours. And you’re in your apartment doing this. Yeah. Was someone helping you? No. Just me holding — Just you. — up my phone. And I had a tripod and that’s it. And in the video, “How to Medical,” it got 23 million views on Twitter. You picked the props, which was a spray bottle. Yeah. How do you choose these props? I mean, just — like the last one I did with him talking about Joe Biden and taking drugs, it’s just like — they’re always projecting. Well, he’s on some kind of an enhancement, in my opinion. So it was just like, he should be taking drugs while he’s talking about someone else taking drugs. I mean, that was just obvious. I want to take one. I’ll take one. He’ll take one. We should both take a drug test. With a hydroxychloroquine — I’d like it. I’d like to take it. A lot of people are taking it. A lot of frontline workers are taking hydroxychloroquine. You know, he sounded very much like a drug dealer during that. I want the people of this nation to feel good. So it’s really just listening and just figuring out the subtext of what he’s saying. What about “man, woman, person, camera,” that one. Oh my god. That’s my favorite. This one took me all day to do. I mean, it was — This is one where you repeat this thing about when he was talking about how he did his cognitive test. How to man, woman, person, camera, TV. Yeah. And you had two people in it. It was you — Or is it person, woman, TV. Whatever. I can’t — Like, you go person, woman, man, camera, TV. So they say, could you repeat that? So you — how did you conceive of that one? So that one, I didn’t use TikTok for. And I started not using TikTok because I figured out how to do it on my own without that software. So while I was doing it, I just thought it would be funny to do a “Usual Suspects” parody so that he’s— people were like, oh, he was just looking at a man, woman, person, camera, TV. But I thought it was more fun if he actually was seeing them somehow. And yeah, I just recorded all of his parts. And then I took a minute to record the reaction of the other person watching him. And it was really difficult because he repeats himself three or four times. And you do that again. And you go person, woman, man, camera, TV. I would do a piece and be like, didn’t I just do that? And I had just done it. Yes. But he was saying it again. Extra points. You get extra points. They say you get extra points. I was like, what are you talking about? When you do take it apart, it really does seem crazy, when it comes out of someone else’s mouth. It really does. Which was the point. So people started to pick up on it. Were you surprised? You had Jerry Seinfeld, Ben Stiller, Jane Lynch. When did you realize this was something big? I mean, that first one went viral. And I got mentioned by Jerry Seinfeld. And that was amazing. And I thought that that was kind of a huge moment. And I did an interview with TMZ. And then they never even aired it. So I felt at that point like it was a one hit wonder kind of thing of just like, well, that was the big thing. And again, I wasn’t going to make anymore. But then he just kept giving me material. And so I kept having to use it. And I still didn’t think anything would be as big as that one. I was kind of just doing it for fun at that point. And then when Ellen called and wanted me on her show, that was like, oh, maybe this is actually getting a little bit bigger, and then Jimmy Fallon. And then I signed with my agent. And then I started meeting famous people. And then I have a Netflix special. And then I have my book got sold to CBS. It just piled on after that. When you think about that — I mean, this would be a comedy career where you’d have to do standup for years, and go around the country, and then maybe get a special and things like that. Yeah. You know, I started doing standup 10 years ago. And I think that at the beginning of this year, I was still of the mind— like what you said. I have to get passed at this club. I have to have my late night set. I have to do these steps. It’s the Seinfeld model, basically. You get your late night set. Then you get your show. And then you become a billionaire. Right. But it doesn’t really happen that way anymore because — and I should have known this from “10 Tricks.” That went viral, and that helped me get a book deal. But creating that platform, going from 60,000 Twitter followers to 2.3 million, that is a proof of concept that the industry can’t ignore. And they really only like people when they see other people like them. You know what I mean? It’s like, oh, people like you? OK, then we like you too. And I think there’s no steps involved, like I did this and this and this. But I’ve been working really hard. I’ve been writing a lot. And now, I have my big break. And now, I want to make a bunch of stuff that I’ve been thinking about for years. And it’s just almost like it was nothing for a long time, and then it was everything. Does the speed worry you? Yeah. I mean, if I didn’t have two books I’ve already written that I can develop into series, I would think that. But I have — I know that, no matter what, I’ll be able to keep writing and keep making things. Sometimes I’m like, well, in a year, is anyone even going to know who I am? And that’s a possibility. It could just be 2020 was my year, and then I’m moving on. But I’ve already started writing shows. And so I feel like I have a lot of opportunity right now that I’m not going to waste. Do you think you’re linked to Trump forever? Yeah, unfortunately. Yeah, I am. So talk about that. Yeah, I know. It’s a little weird. But I just think about your bio. And yeah, my Success is forever linked to this person that I absolutely hate. Do you think he’s actually funny himself? No, mm-mm. You don’t think he has a sense. He makes a lot of jokes in speeches. Oh, OK. I don’t. Tell me why he’s not funny then. He’s not funny because any attempt at humor comes from a place of deep insecurity and ugliness. Well, you can describe a lot of comics like that though. It was all about your pain and ugliness becomes comedy. OK. That, in addition to a lack of self-awareness about that insecurity and ugliness. You have to be aware of it in order to be funny. And I just think that he’s not even remotely self-aware. And I don’t think he has joy in his life. I mean, I don’t know how you are supposed to bring joy to other people with humor if you actually don’t know what the experience of joy is. Because I don’t know if he knows what that is. So he’s not funny. But how would you describe the humor then? OK. So if I was writing — the tweet he wrote the other day about “60 Minutes,” and my magnificent answers to her horrible cues, like — I tweeted that. And I was like, I would love to write like this. Because if this was intentional, it would be hysterical. And he is unintentionally brilliant in his satire. [LAUGHS] It’s a really, actually really good. The quote where he’s like, “I’m really actually very humble. I don’t think how humble I am, but I am probably one of the most humble people you’ll ever meet,” no self awareness of the fact that what you just said is the least humble thing you could be saying. That type of irony is something that writers like aspire towards. But he’s nailed it without even trying. You know what I mean? Right. You could do a whole thing on his tweets by writing — I could do a whole thing on his tweets, the whole thing about how I’m like — you know, I’m a smart guy. I have a really good you know what. He forgot the word for brain while he was bragging about how smart he is. But that is brilliant comedy. You know what I mean? [LAUGHTER] (LAUGHING) Yeah, it is in a lot of ways. So do you draw the line at any Trump impressions? There’s moments you could have lip synced that are absurd — the spreading Covid misinformation, having Covid, all kinds of things. Is there anything you would not lip sync because it’s too horrifying to find humor in? Or is every— the policies on immigrant children, when he suggested the late Michigan Congressman John Dingell was looking up from hell. Is there anything that you decided not to do? Yeah, a lot of those things you mentioned. I mean, anything where — he fumbled some words during a Memorial Day service. And people were like, oh, you should do this because he can’t speak. But it’s still a Memorial Day service, so I’m not going to touch that. The thing he said about George Floyd being proud of what was happening, I’ll never do that. Anything that — He even said something, and I almost started to do it, about friends that he lost to Covid. But the way he said it was just like, yeah, he was a friend of mine. I guess he was a friend. I saw him a few times. You know, it was so obvious that it wasn’t a friend. And so it was a good thing to make fun of. But at the same time, there’s death involved, so I didn’t want to do it. So — Right. Right. Do you have to like someone when you’re doing an impression? Norm MacDonald doesn’t like Alec Baldwin’s Trump impression, which is the full-scale, dressed up, looking like and making the facial expressions. His philosophy was quote, “if you do an impression of someone, you have to like that person.” He says, “contempt alone doesn’t work.” Is there anything you like about Trump or not? Here’s the thing. I have imposter syndrome. And Trump has the opposite of imposter syndrome. I question everything I say. And he thinks everything he says is brilliant. And there is a part of me that would absolutely love that as a superpower. You know what I mean? To stop questioning everything I think and to actually have that confidence. And so I think that’s the difference between me and Alec Baldwin is Alec Baldwin very much hates him, but also, is at the same level powerwise as him. I’m not. And I feel like that’s where my sort of impression, which I don’t even think they’re really impressions, it comes from a different angle of just like, what if I could be up there where he is, and say whatever I want, and not be questioned, and still be praised? Is that why you think it’s effective? A lot of people talk about the juxtaposition of you being— you’re an immigrant woman from Jamaica. You’re a person of color. I think it is because of what you’re talking about is the power differential. And you hear him. For some reason, through you, you actually hear the ridiculousness of him. I mean, I think that’s the irony of it is just you see a Black woman speaking, and you’re a little bit more suspicious. And I kind of took advantage of that. And because you’re a little bit more suspicious, you’re actually listening to what he’s saying. You realize he’s saying it, not me. And you’re like, oh. So I feel like whether it’s power, or for some people, it very much is that he’s white, I’m Black. I think for a lot of people, that’s part of it. But no matter what it is, I look absolutely nothing like him. And I don’t try to look like him. And they like that. Would it play as well if it was a white male comic? They’ve tried it. It wouldn’t. It wouldn’t. It doesn’t. That’s the other thing is that I — for a while, I was like, what am I doing? Is this even special or anything like that? But then I look at other people trying to do what I do, and it does take some effort. You can’t just move your lips. There has to be a little bit more involved. And I do think it’s not as funny when a white guy is doing it. It just isn’t. The lips syncing, I mean. So many people are like, when they hear my real voice, they expect to hear Donald Trump’s voice. And I feel like the visual trick of convincing people that this voice was actually coming out of my mouth is something that takes some effort. Absolutely. Is there any trick that you use? Or do you think — I think it’s really just being convincing. It’s like acting in a silent movie and convincingly emoting, even though it’s not your voice. It is a silent movie. That’s a great way to think about it. So YouTube comments are surprisingly positive. I was looking at a bunch of them. I know, right. I don’t understand it. Right? I don’t have to write Susan. Me either. We’re just gay about that. But even the MAGA crowd likes you. Are they not getting the joke? I remember “Silicon Valley,” the HBO show. And I’d go to parties, and all the Silicon Valley guys goes, oh, that’s a great show. I’m like, that show hates you, whatever. What do you think is at work there? Yeah, it’s interesting hearing that from you. Because people do enjoy being roasted. You’re being roasted, but you like it somehow. I got — Because the attention’s on you. Yeah, I was roasted for my birthday, and I loved it. I feel like with — yeah, with them, I couldn’t — I think that they — They don’t hate you. They hate a lot of comics. They hate Michelle. There’s all kinds of comics, especially women comics, that get attacked by MAGA. I’m sure it’ll happen eventually. So I’m not looking forward to it. But right now, it’s — the biggest hit I get is that I’m a Boomer comedian, which I’ve been accused of being only for Boomers. Only Boomers like me, which I probably shouldn’t perpetuate. But on my special, I met Winona Ryder. And she came up to me. And she’s like, my mom loves you. So — [LAUGHTER] Maybe it’s true. Yeah, I want to get to your special in a second. But I want to finish this. So Trump is not a fan. Do you feel powerful knowing that you’ve been able to get under his skin? I kind of do because he was asked about my videos. And he pretended to not have seen them. And I think it genuinely bothers him that I’ve separated his voice from his physical presentation because I think he works very hard on— I’ve heard that he watches his interviews without sound because he thinks that people are all visual, and they’re not actually listening. So they’re really visual. If you look strong, and in control, and powerful, and you pretend like there’s a huge crowd when there’s no crowd that people will be convinced. And so the fact that I’ve taken that away, I think, really bothers him. Right. Right. Have you gotten anything from the group around him? Nothing. No. Nothing at all. Knock on wood. I haven’t gotten anything. And I think the MAGA crowd, I think that they either don’t see it as making fun of him, or they really like him so much, yeah, that they like the attention that he’s getting from it. Right. Yeah, that’s one thing. And you’ve called yourself the Trump whisperer. Why do you call yourself that? I’ve just started getting into his head a little bit. And the thing that I noticed recently as his discomfort around feminism and how he try— there’s one where he wants to say mailman. But then he was like, or mailwoman. The mailman. He’s trying to be a feminist, but it’s a thing that catches in his head or something. And then it’s so condescending when it comes out. It’s like or mailwoman. From the mailman and the mailwomen. Every single time, it’s so funny. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Sway.

Election Day is coming up. Do you think you’ve done your last Trump TikTok? That’s a good question. I don’t think so. You think you’re not going to do anymore. Well, that’s what’s — well, what if, on the night of the election, he decides to give a speech accepting his win, despite the fact that he didn’t win, or we don’t know yet, or whatever. I don’t know. Maybe on the day that he’s— [BARKING] That’s your dog, right? That’s my dog. That’s OK. Ah, stop. [KISSES] So maybe on the day that Joe Biden is inaugurated, I’ll do that speech where he’s accepted his win or something like that. [LAUGHS] That’s a good one. So I know you won’t miss the muse. But are you tired of your muse? I’m very tired of him. He’s — you know the whole thing about how we have more cases because we test more? I did that video so many months ago. And people are like, do the one where he — and I’m like, he’s been saying the same thing. He says the same thing over and over and over again. So there’s — I don’t know what else there is. Now, one of the other things you’ve done is the political impact of your comedy. Now, political scientists found that Tina Fey’s Palin impression made Republican and Independent supporters Sarah Palin less attractive to them as a candidate. Are you — do you think you’re changing the minds of Republicans and Independents or just playing to an echo chamber? I think that, yes, there was an echo chamber. But there are people who had checked out who checked back in because of my videos. I think that that probably happened. And hopefully, it got them to realize what the hell was going on if they were missing it. So I don’t know if I changed their minds so much as I made them a little bit more involved with what was going on. I don’t think I changed the mind of any — any Trump supporter, no. They might be able to laugh at my video, but they’re still going to vote for Trump. I don’t think I really changed anybody’s minds there. So what do you want to do next? Talk about what you’re doing with this new Netflix show, which is called “Everything is Fine.” “Everything’s Fine.” “Everything’s Fine,” which is the famous life in hell kind of thing. So explain — describe what you’re doing. Because it’s not standup. I was trying to figure out what it was last night when I was watching it. It’s not — You saw It? Yes, of course I did. Oh my god. You have so many celebrities. I’m like, oh, no, there’s Winona Ryder under the desk. How did she show up? That was a shocker, I have to tell you. And then Marisa Tomei. And you’re in bed with Jon Hamm. All of a sudden — talk about what you’re doing. Because it’s not standup. So what did — how did you conceive of “Everything’s Fine?” Yeah, I mean — I was just thinking about how we’re just inundated with news now. And everyone’s so glued to the news and what’s happening because we’re living in this crazy world where something crazy happens every second. So I just had this idea of this morning show anchor who basically has a breakdown and ends up under the desk. [MUSIC PLAYING] This story is about Sarah Cooper, who was a Morning News anchor from the spring of 2017 to the fall of 2020. At her peak, Cooper had a HUT rating of 54 and a 27 audience share. She looks all right here. But inside, she’s losing her mind. I knew I wanted to do a sketch special because doing standup right now without an audience would suck. But I wanted it to feel like “Mr. Show” because that’s one of my favorite sketch shows. And so I just had this idea to do this sort of overarching story with this morning show anchor, but then have sketches throughout. And so — Commercials and things like that. Yeah, parody commercials. Just have it feel kind of like one thing and be surprising and just something that you have trouble describing, like you don’t even really know what it is, to be able to be a morning show anchor, and then have Trump call in, and Trump is me, and have me — just stuff like that where there is no format, really. And you’re seeing behind the scenes because Fred Armisen is behind the scenes as my producer. And — So what were you trying to get through in it? Because some of it — at the end, I was quite uncomfortable, I have to say, especially the Helen Mirren part. For some reason, that exchange was so disturbing. Yeah. Helen Mirren and you are talking about attacking women, essentially, which was really, really disturbing. I have to say, that particular scene — you’re in the bus. You’re in an actual bus. And she got into it heavy. She was playing— what’s that guy? What’s the guy who was — Billy Bush. Right, Billy Bush. Yeah. It’d better not be the publicist. No, it’s her. Yeah, that’s her, with the gold. I gotta use some Tic-Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. [LAUGHS] You just kiss. I don’t even — and you’re a star, they let you do it. [LAUGHS] You just kiss. You just kiss. You can do anything. Whatever you want. Talk about where you were going ‘cause I think you were trying to make people uncomfortable in the sketch show. Well, I mean, I was trying to encapsulate what 2020 has been. And what 2020 has been is just something that you can’t really describe. It’s been very unpredictable, very disconcerting. Everyone feels like they’re not sure what the future is going to hold. Is it a time capsule? Or is this going to be our life? So I think that that’s kind of what I was going for, something that’s just unpredictable and just makes you feel a little — you know, just seen in terms of like, this is what we’re all going through. When you have the title “Everything’s Fine,” do you think everything’s fine? No. [LAUGHS] It is not fine. Everything’s not fine. And the more we say that everything’s fine when it’s not, the worse things get. So I think it’s about being honest about the fact that no, this isn’t fine. So I did get the right impression from your show. Everything’s not fine. Everything is not fine. When you think about where we’re going, one of the things I think about is the impact that Trump has had on culture, the larger impact. Mm-hmm. Give me your thoughts of what you think that will mean. Because everything is about him. Not just comedy is about him, the news. Everything is reacting to whatever idiotic thing he said that day. A lot of good things happened to you that wouldn’t have been possible without him. Right. Does it ever give you cognitive dissonance to have this happen? This is a terrible year, and your show is about the terrible year. Yeah, I mean, it does. I always — when I looked at YouTube influencers, I always thought that when you die, in your obituary, they’re going to mention YouTube. So [LAUGHS] the fact that in my obituary, Trump will probably be mentioned, TikTok will probably be mentioned, these things that — I absolutely hate Trump. So I mean, yeah, I don’t even know if I would have broken through had it not been for this. And I think that that’s the beauty of the internet is because you can — everyone can share something. And if enough people like it, and enough people want more of it, it can legitimize you in a way that nothing else can. So I mean, I owe a lot of my success to going viral on the internet. So it lets people like me, who don’t look like the standard form of a Hollywood starlet, be able to break through and become not only an actress, but a writer, and a producer, and all of the things that I want to do. So I highly recommend checking out the internet, if you haven’t checked it out yet. [LAUGHTER] Yeah, it’s the ethernets, the internets. The kids love it. The kids love it, apparently. What do you want to do next? What do what think — what comedy appeals to you? TV. TV. TV. TV. I want to do TV. Would you like to be on a show like “SNL,” for example? As a performer? Yeah. As a host, yes. Yeah, as a host, OK. [LAUGHS] Oh, aim high, Sarah Cooper. Ensemble stuff, forget it. Screw that. I would have loved to have been on “SNL” as a cast member a year ago. But now, I have other things that I really wanted to do. So — Oh, wow. [LAUGHS] I mean, it is so thrilling to me to take something like— there’s a chapter in my book called “How to be Harassed without Hurting His Career.” And that’s what a lot of women have gone through. It’s just like you need to be harassed by the right person at the right time. Don’t get harassed by the C.E.O. because then you are [expletive]. You know? To take that and to write a story around it, and put characters in, and have people experience that, and tell a story is just so exciting and thrilling to me. So that just feels like the next phase of this is to be able to take my cartoons that maybe turned into these 60-second videos, and turn it into a full series. It’s just being able to take up more space and say more. The essence is the same. but being able to explore it from so many different angles and give people that experience is really exciting to me. So what about — when you think about TV, you don’t think the internet is where you want to make your comedy. I mean, I guess when I say TV, I just mean a series with characters that people follow. I don’t know what platform that is. But it’s — Well, look, Quibi’s gone. I’m sorry to tell you. I don’t if you’ve heard. [Expletive] What? [LAUGHTER] I’m making everything for Quibi. Goddamn. Did you have a Quibi deal? I didn’t. And I’m so glad I didn’t. I was — But at the beginning of the year, that’s what I wanted. Right, right, right. Now, you don’t. But it doesn’t seem to work on the internet. These TV networks don’t seem to work on the internet for some reason. They’re going to figure it out. And you know what. I think you and me, we’re going to start a media company, like a real one. OK. All right. And then it’s going to take the entertainment that you might find on television, and we’re going to combine it with the essence of the internet that makes things successful there, and it’s going to be amazing. Oh, I like that. So how do you make money? How are you making money now? Is there any money you’ve made on the Trump videos? Twitter is very far behind YouTube in terms of being able to monetize. But I was able to make thousands of dollars on YouTube. Thousands. OK. Yeah, I would take the TikToks and post them on YouTube, same format. Oh, YouTube, OK. And I would monetize those with ads. But Twitter I wasn’t able to monetize. And I got the most views on Twitter, so I left the most money on the table at Twitter. Right. So you made no money on those. No. And is that thousands per video? Or all of the videos, you made thousands? Oh, you want to know exactly how much I made. Yeah, I do. I do. Oh my god. So you want to know. I’ll tell you how much I made for the person, man, woman, TV video. Which you put on YouTube from TikTok. “How To Person, Woman, Man, Camera, TV” revenue, estimated revenue, lifetime estimated revenue, $19,463.72 Wow. So that’s how much YouTube paid me for that video. Hmm. And 0 on Twitter. And 0 on Twitter. Yeah. I guess you don’t want to tell me your Netflix salary. So you don’t have to. Don’t worry. I’m not going to ask. I’m not get— So when you think about what you — if everything fell apart — you’ve had so many opportunities this year. I don’t think that’s going to be the case — Which internet company would you go back to work for? Ooh, good question. Yeah, I’m full of them, Sarah. Which internet company? I’d go back to Google. Yeah. Would you? Yeah, absolutely. Which internet company would you not work for? Besides Facebook? Yeah. I got that. I got that impression. Probably Etsy because I think it should be “Eetsy,” and I wouldn’t be able to work there because I’d just keep mispronouncing the name of the company. [LAUGHS] I am going to ask you one last question. When you look at someone like Kamala Harris and others, if Biden wins, is this a funny administration? No, it’s boring. Yeah. It’s very boring. Yeah. But we have to stay engaged because my biggest regret is not voting in 2010. Obama won. It was amazing. And I think I checked out. I think a ton of people just checked out. And so it’s not going to be interesting. It’s not going to be exciting. Trump will hopefully be off doing something that we can laugh at because it won’t be affecting us. But Biden and Harris are going to be very, very boring. And hopefully they will get a lot done because hopefully Democrats will take all of the branches. So that’s what I hope. Boring, but I’m still going to be engaged. Is there a Biden impression? No. I don’t think so. You don’t think — is there any politician? Pick a politician, not Trump. If you had to pick one. Or anybody, anybody. Hannity. Hannity. Yeah, any Fox News anchor. Yeah, any — if you watch Fox News now, it’s the best satire on television because it’s people who have brains rationally defending the absolutely irrational. And it’s complete satire. So any of them. Elon Musk I did, and I will always enjoy because he’s ridiculous. Any — somebody called it reverse mansplaining. And so anybody who mansplains a lot, and I can show them how smug they sound will be fun. OK, well, then, there’s — you’ve got a career for the rest of your life, I think. The rest of my life. The rest of your life. Sarah, thank you so much. And good luck with the special. Thank you. And good luck with everything you’re doing. Thank you so much. And say hi to your husband. I will. All right, thanks, Sarah. Bye. [MUSIC PLAYING] “Sway” is a production of New York Times Opinion. Is produced by Nayeema Raza, Heba Elorbany, Matt Kwong, and Vishakha Darbha.

I just saw Fox News picked up my Hillary interview. So I’m tweeting, going, thanks for listening, Fox News. Oh my god, Fox News. Fox News. Ugh. Ugh. God. Anyway. How you doing. Are you OK? Is it early? Where are you? New York? Yeah I mean — Sarah Cooper is an author, comedian, and recently became a Netflix star. But right now, she’s wandering around an empty WeWork, trying to find a quiet place to talk to me. Is everything OK? No. It’s a real struggle. Yeah, it’s like a washing machine. There’s, like, street noise. Oh. It sounds like a jackhammer. Oh, all right. This should be quieter. Is there still kombucha there? No. On tap? There’s not even coffee on this floor. Like, that’s how dead it is here. OK. [LAUGHTER] OK. Good. Cooper went viral in April for her TikTok videos lip syncing Donald Trump. We were under lockdown. And the president, well, he was off his rocker — — And then I see disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute, and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it’d be interesting to check that. When Trump became Cooper’s muse, she mouthed his words from her living room with props like Flintstone vitamins and Kaboom bathroom cleaner. Watching his words come out of her mouth was horrifying. But it was also hilarious. [MUSIC PLAYING] So you’re famous for skewering Trump. You found fans in Jerry Seinfeld and Maya Rudolph, who is producing your Netflix special with you right now. But before you spent all this time, you had a long stint on Google. So most people don’t know about that. Yeah, it’s weird. I just got a text message from Ramy Youssef. It’s like, I didn’t know you worked on Google Docs. I love Google Docs. Yeah, I have some questions about Google Docs in a second. But go ahead. I was a designer on Google Docs. And my first product was Google Slides. Actually, I was the lead designer on Google Slides. And then I became the manager of the team that designs all of Google Docs, Sheets, Slides. And now I’m a user, an avid user. So how did you get there? Explain to people how you got to Google. Google was my fallback career. It was my plan B. I was trying to do standup comedy. I was trying to do acting. I moved from Atlanta to New York to pursue that. And it just got really expensive to be here. So a former colleague of mine who I went to school with at Georgia Tech was working here in Chelsea at the Google offices here and recommended me for a job there. I applied for a design position. They offered me a job. And I felt like I was kind of giving up a dream when they offered me the job. But I couldn’t say no. Right. Were you a designer by training? Yeah, so I went to Georgia Tech for digital design. I got my master’s degree in what was called information design back then, but it’s called digital design now. Yeah, so — and I was a designer for a long time. I worked at Yahoo on Yahoo Travel for a while. I worked on Flickr, took a break, and then went broke, and then went back to Google, and then left Google six years ago. So when you — at Yahoo Travel, what did you design? The home page, the Yahoo Travel home page, the personalization, the top 10 places you might want to go and all that stuff. [LAUGHS] And did you like it? Did you like doing it? I did. I mean, you know, I always thought that everybody liked being on the computer. But I went into a coffee shop once, and I saw somebody just on the computer, just pissed. They just had this pissed look on their face. And not everyone likes to be on a laptop. And I can just — I can be at a desk. It’s taken me a while to admit it because I don’t think it’s cool. But I feel very comfortable in an office space. And so what did you do for Google Docs? We have a lot of questions about Google Docs? Why am I an anonymous hippo, for example? Why is that? OK. So this was a fun thing. And it’s been around so long. And it’s kind of like when you go into a document and we don’t — you’re anonymized, we don’t recognize you, or you haven’t signed in — That’s — I never sign into Google. — we assign animals. We assign animals with a color so that you can still see that you’re in the document, and you can see that there are other animals there. So it’s just a fun thing. Do you not like it? Kara, do not like fun? Do you not like having fun when you’re — I don’t like fun. OK. I don’t like having fun in Google Docs. Go ahead. I will let them know, Kara. Thank you. I will let them know. That’s all right. I send little notes to them all the time. There you go. Sundar. I’m sure you do. Sundar. [LAUGHTER] Anyway — Oh my god. Do you really send notes to Sundar about — Yes, I do. Oh my god. Yes, I do. Poor Sundar. Why wouldn’t I? And Susan. I was mad about something on YouTube. I sent it to Susan and my kids. Yeah. [LAUGHS] I have their emails. I might as well go to the top. Oh my god. But when you — so you’re trying to have fun in a Google Doc. That’s what your design thing was. Yeah. [LAUGHS] And it was interesting. You still say “we” when talking about Google. Do you feel like you’re still part of it? There’s a whole Google ethos. Because I was married to an ex-Google executive. I did not know that. Yeah. And so I know a lot about especially early Google. How do you look at that time of working there? I feel so fortunate because it wasn’t the main campus. The New York office, and especially, Google Docs felt like a real family. The trip where I met my husband was a five-day offsite to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Oh, OK. They love those. Google loves those. Yes. And yeah, we were all sitting there, like, ugh, this private beach is not the best, or whatever. You know? That’s so Google. We were just like — Wearing head to toe Google swag, right? [LAUGHS] Complaining about the chairs. They had Google umbrellas. Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah, getting our drinks served to us. And yeah, that’s where I met my husband. I mean, it was just like a small family. So one of the things you did is wrote a book about office politics and things like that. It was called “How to Be Successful Without Hurting Men’s Feelings,” which is your time in the office. I’ve always been the kind of person who just observes people. And I didn’t really pay attention to it before. But even when I was at Yahoo, and sitting in a meeting, and I saw someone translate percentages into fractions, and I wrote it down. I was like, this is how you look smart in a meeting. You translate— so I was always just kind of observing people. Explain that for people who don’t understand. Oh, well, yeah, no. Somebody said, 25% of people clicked on this button, and then someone was just like, oh, about 1 in 4, interesting. [LAUGHS] It didn’t add any information. It just kind of like put it in a new spin. And everybody was like, oh, yea, 1 in 4. Thank you so much for crystallizing that for us. You know? You made it so much clearer. And it’s just so stupid. I wrote that down immediately. And I think because the corporate world is so sort of passive-aggressive, you can get away with saying absolutely nothing, and everyone’s just sort of like nodding around you. And it’s not unlike what happens with Trump and the people just agreeing with him because he’s the president. Give me some other examples that you saw. Because the book is very funny. And you had illustrations and everything. Yeah. So number one, draw a Venn diagram. It doesn’t even matter what it says. People are just like, wow, that’s a really awesome graphic. Pace around the room is one of my favorite because you don’t even have to say anything. But if you just get up and pace, people think that you’re — Larry Page does that. Yeah. The founder of Google does that rather a lot. Yeah. My favorite is interrupt someone and then let them finish, which is called the Kanye. So somebody is giving their update. And you can be like, I’m so sorry, Jim, I’m just going to stop you right there. Everyone, Jim’s update’s really important. So if everyone can just pay attention. OK, go ahead, Jim. You know? [LAUGHTER] It just makes you look like you’re totally in charge. That’s true. So Google’s not very funny right now. It’s in the news. Do you have any thoughts about the antitrust? Or do you— your husband still works there so perhaps you don’t want to comment on it. But what do you think when you see that? You worked for a company that felt like family, and now, of course, the government is going after it. And you know this has been a long time brewing here. Yeah. I — yeah, I’m still on the health insurance, so I don’t want to say anything. But you know — Well, what about big tech in general? Yeah. I mean, I would say they do have a lot of power. And you know, it’s weird because I have this thing of like, yeah, Google does have a monopoly sort of on Search. But it’s because it’s the best search. I do think there should be more competition. But at the same time, I think they build a really good product. Although I think competition would make Google better. I think that it would actually improve if there were people that were actually nipping at their heels versus what they have now, which is just — and that’s why you’ll get results that feel like most of the first page is ads. And that’s not a good user experience. So I do feel that government needs to get involved and start regulating some of this stuff because these things have hurt us. Facebook, Twitter, all of this has hurt humanity. We’re so addicted to it. And it’s so bad for us, you know? Talk about leaving Google. You decided — here, you have a really good job. You did your comedy on the side, writing a book. How did you decide to move on from that? I’d been a manager for about a year and a half. And when you become a manager, you stop doing things. You just start being in meetings all the time. And so I feel like part of it was just that I need to feel creative, and I just didn’t feel creative. And then, when you become a manager, you have to be a cheerleader. You have to get the team excited, like this is the best thing that we could all be doing with our time. And if you don’t actually feel that way, you can kind of feel like you’re living a double life. And that’s kind of how I started to feel, especially when millions of people were reading “10 Tricks to Appear Smart in Meetings.” And I wanted to just write more stuff like that. I just wanted to keep doing that. And I really started to — my attention started to just not be towards what I was doing. And I just felt bad about that. But I could have done both. And even my — he was my fiancé at the time. He was like, Sarah, do you really want to leave? Because when I see you at work, you look happy. And I was happy. I just was in meetings, thinking about other things. Even when I finally decided to say goodbye to Google, I had a panic attack. I thought that I was leaving too quickly. I didn’t have a book deal. That was — my manager’s first question was just like, you’re leaving to write, but you don’t have a book deal? And I was like, oh, I guess I should get one of those. But he said I could always come back, you know? And so hearing that, I was just like, well, if I can always come back, how much of a risk is it really? Mm-hmm. Yeah, that’s 100% correct. Plus, you could work at Facebook if you really needed to. Oh god, no. I want to work at a real tech company. [LAUGHS] What? You don’t think it’s a real tech company? (LAUGHING) No. I do not. Why is that? It’s built on psychology. That whole company is built on psychology. And it’s just manipulative. And I don’t know. It’s just scary to me. Yeah. Yeah. Well, there’s a lot of design things going in there. That’s why. Design is a critical part of it of how you push that button, which I think you worked on. How do you get people to use enjoyable use things? Yeah I mean, and that — when I was studying at Georgia Tech, that was the question is, how do you make something addictive? We were trying to make addictive things. Then you want people to — you want it to be sticky. You want people to spend all their time there. That’s a data point that people are like, oh, someone spent four hours on our app. This is great. And then it’s like, no, actually, that’s bad for that person. [LAUGHS] Right. How do you get people addicted? What are the tricks that maybe people don’t know about? Well, it’s interesting. But if you make — anything that feels personalized to you makes you feel special. So I mean, Facebook has nailed it. It says, good morning, Sarah. And it’s like, tell people what you’re doing. And it makes you feel important. It makes you— and then the likes come in, and then that makes you feel like, oh, people are seeing me. I mean, it’s Dale Carnegie, “How to Win Friends and Influence People.” Every single one of those things was used in this app because it says your name over and over again. It makes you feel like people are watching you. That’s the type of stuff that people can’t get enough of. Was their design tricks that you could do to do that? A lot of it is text because that is — some people love the color blue, but some people hate the color blue. But if you say “Sarah” in big letters, and it’s my name, I’m going to read that and be like, oh, it’s talking to me. You know what I mean? So I think that’s a big thing. And then all of the little fun little animations you see, like when you click the heart, and you see it expand and fade away, that makes you feel good, like you did something. Anything that makes you feel like you’re doing something. Did you ever feel bad about that? Because there’s a lot of people who left who were design focused. Did you ever feel bad about what you were doing? I mean, I feel — not at Google because I was working on something that helped people be productive. And so that was cool. But when I hear — my mom has unfriended family members over what’s going on. And she’ll just scroll Facebook and kind of like — I don’t know — feel jealous of people, and feel like she’s missing out on things. And it’s— watching her do that, that is like — that’s not good. Those aren’t good feelings. And so feeling like I helped part of that system create these experiences, yeah, that makes me feel bad. And the notifications, and she’s just getting an email. She doesn’t know how to turn it off. She gets an email every single time anybody likes anything or sees anything. Why? That’s not important. People have taken this thing, and they’ve made it so important in their lives. So you, yourself, have used tech to further your career. So let’s talk about how you did that. You went viral in April for your Donald Trump lip syncs on TikTok. I want you to walk through why you decided to do TikTok. You were doing it to keep you sane during quarantine. Now, people had done Donald Trump lip syncs. So you talk about the process and then why you think it took off the way it did. Yeah, I mean, I was just playing around with TikTok. And I’ve always liked lip syncing. But I never made a big deal about it. When I was little, I lip synced songs all the time because I wanted to be a singer. And I found a Donald Trump clip quote. And I just lip synced it because I kind of wanted to be like one of those guys in the meetings who’s just saying absolutely nothing, but everybody thought I was the best. And I think the thing that flipped it was, when you do an impression of someone like Donald Trump, you put on the makeup, you do the hair, you have the tie, you do all of those things to be — that’s an impression. You be as much like him as possible. I went the other way. I was like, I’m not trying to be him. I’m trying to say, what if he was me? You know what I mean? What if I could just embody that absolute confidence, despite the fact that I sound like an idiot? And I think— when people write me, they’re like, I’m so glad I get to hear what he’s saying without seeing him. Without seeing the physicality. I don’t want to see him. What was the first quote you used? The first quote was, “I’m going to form a committee.” We’re going to have a few committees. I’ll call them committees. “And we’re going to make decisions. And we’re going to make decisions fairly quickly. And I think they’re going to be the right decisions.” So saying nothing. Absolutely nothing, but in a way that it made it sound like he invented the concept of committee. So is that why you chose it? ‘Cause this is a thing you had written about before, these kind of meaningless meeting speak. Yes. That was exactly it. When I heard it, and you’re seeing him say this, and you’re seeing people behind him go, yep— was this committee ever formed? No. You know what I mean? [LAUGHTER] Maybe you were glad it wasn’t formed actually, honestly. Why did you think this would stick? Did you have a feeling about it at the time? I didn’t. I mean, I shared a few clips. And people were like, oh, this is funny. I got a little bit of traction but not much, and wasn’t going to do any more because other people had started to do it. Yeah, there was a whole trend on TikTok. Yeah. You had just come to TikTok, right? You had not — you had been a Twitter person, as I recall. Exactly. Yeah, mainly all Twitter. And I was like, this isn’t even original anymore. So I don’t think I’m going to do it. But then he did the Lysol and the UV light. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, you can — which you can do, either through the skin or in some other way. I heard it. And I just saw the whole thing in my mind. It sounds interesting. We’ll get the right folks equipment. And then I see the disinfectant. I saw the props. I saw me as the other character, going, what are you talking about? And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or — I saw it. And so I just had to do it. Even though I had decided to stop doing them, I just had to do it. And I’m glad I did. So talk about that creative process. You heard it, and it struck you just ‘cause it was so strange. What did you see? I just — I closed my eyes, and I saw — you know, I saw, “we can inject it into the veins.” I saw UV light in some other way. I think he says something in some other way. And I saw me, like, what other way would it be? And he was like, you’re going to check on that, right? And I just saw being the other person, being like, check on what? You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. So I think it was just — I just saw it all in my head. And that’s what made me — and that’s a similar process to what I do. If I hear a clip and it becomes activated in my mind — I can see it visually — that makes me want to do it. So you have to see it visually. And so you picked TikTok over Twitter, why? Well, TikTok is really easy to take audio, and lip sync it, and create video to it. I mean, it’s just a really good, efficient tool for that. And that’s the only reason why I was using it. I was taking those videos and putting them on Twitter. And that’s where they were going viral because Twitter is so much more about news and what’s going on now. And this had news, what’s going on now, and comedy, and politics, and everything kind of wrapped up in one thing. So of course, it was going to go viral on Twitter. But TikTok is a great tool. It’s a great editing tool. So yeah, you just take the phone. And you’re just recording yourself. And it’s very sequential and chronological. So you record this bit, then this bit, then this bit. And after 60 seconds, you’re done. Right. And so you did this — you do these in 60 seconds. They’re that quick. Well, no, I mean — to make a 60-second one, it takes me two to five hours to do. Two to five hours. And you’re in your apartment doing this. Yeah. Was someone helping you? No. Just me holding — Just you. — up my phone. And I had a tripod and that’s it. And in the video, “How to Medical,” it got 23 million views on Twitter. You picked the props, which was a spray bottle. Yeah. How do you choose these props? I mean, just — like the last one I did with him talking about Joe Biden and taking drugs, it’s just like — they’re always projecting. Well, he’s on some kind of an enhancement, in my opinion. So it was just like, he should be taking drugs while he’s talking about someone else taking drugs. I mean, that was just obvious. I want to take one. I’ll take one. He’ll take one. We should both take a drug test. With a hydroxychloroquine — I’d like it. I’d like to take it. A lot of people are taking it. A lot of frontline workers are taking hydroxychloroquine. You know, he sounded very much like a drug dealer during that. I want the people of this nation to feel good. So it’s really just listening and just figuring out the subtext of what he’s saying. What about “man, woman, person, camera,” that one. Oh my god. That’s my favorite. This one took me all day to do. I mean, it was — This is one where you repeat this thing about when he was talking about how he did his cognitive test. How to man, woman, person, camera, TV. Yeah. And you had two people in it. It was you — Or is it person, woman, TV. Whatever. I can’t — Like, you go person, woman, man, camera, TV. So they say, could you repeat that? So you — how did you conceive of that one? So that one, I didn’t use TikTok for. And I started not using TikTok because I figured out how to do it on my own without that software. So while I was doing it, I just thought it would be funny to do a “Usual Suspects” parody so that he’s— people were like, oh, he was just looking at a man, woman, person, camera, TV. But I thought it was more fun if he actually was seeing them somehow. And yeah, I just recorded all of his parts. And then I took a minute to record the reaction of the other person watching him. And it was really difficult because he repeats himself three or four times. And you do that again. And you go person, woman, man, camera, TV. I would do a piece and be like, didn’t I just do that? And I had just done it. Yes. But he was saying it again. Extra points. You get extra points. They say you get extra points. I was like, what are you talking about? When you do take it apart, it really does seem crazy, when it comes out of someone else’s mouth. It really does. Which was the point. So people started to pick up on it. Were you surprised? You had Jerry Seinfeld, Ben Stiller, Jane Lynch. When did you realize this was something big? I mean, that first one went viral. And I got mentioned by Jerry Seinfeld. And that was amazing. And I thought that that was kind of a huge moment. And I did an interview with TMZ. And then they never even aired it. So I felt at that point like it was a one hit wonder kind of thing of just like, well, that was the big thing. And again, I wasn’t going to make anymore. But then he just kept giving me material. And so I kept having to use it. And I still didn’t think anything would be as big as that one. I was kind of just doing it for fun at that point. And then when Ellen called and wanted me on her show, that was like, oh, maybe this is actually getting a little bit bigger, and then Jimmy Fallon. And then I signed with my agent. And then I started meeting famous people. And then I have a Netflix special. And then I have my book got sold to CBS. It just piled on after that. When you think about that — I mean, this would be a comedy career where you’d have to do standup for years, and go around the country, and then maybe get a special and things like that. Yeah. You know, I started doing standup 10 years ago. And I think that at the beginning of this year, I was still of the mind— like what you said. I have to get passed at this club. I have to have my late night set. I have to do these steps. It’s the Seinfeld model, basically. You get your late night set. Then you get your show. And then you become a billionaire. Right. But it doesn’t really happen that way anymore because — and I should have known this from “10 Tricks.” That went viral, and that helped me get a book deal. But creating that platform, going from 60,000 Twitter followers to 2.3 million, that is a proof of concept that the industry can’t ignore. And they really only like people when they see other people like them. You know what I mean? It’s like, oh, people like you? OK, then we like you too. And I think there’s no steps involved, like I did this and this and this. But I’ve been working really hard. I’ve been writing a lot. And now, I have my big break. And now, I want to make a bunch of stuff that I’ve been thinking about for years. And it’s just almost like it was nothing for a long time, and then it was everything. Does the speed worry you? Yeah. I mean, if I didn’t have two books I’ve already written that I can develop into series, I would think that. But I have — I know that, no matter what, I’ll be able to keep writing and keep making things. Sometimes I’m like, well, in a year, is anyone even going to know who I am? And that’s a possibility. It could just be 2020 was my year, and then I’m moving on. But I’ve already started writing shows. And so I feel like I have a lot of opportunity right now that I’m not going to waste. Do you think you’re linked to Trump forever? Yeah, unfortunately. Yeah, I am. So talk about that. Yeah, I know. It’s a little weird. But I just think about your bio. And yeah, my Success is forever linked to this person that I absolutely hate. Do you think he’s actually funny himself? No, mm-mm. You don’t think he has a sense. He makes a lot of jokes in speeches. Oh, OK. I don’t. Tell me why he’s not funny then. He’s not funny because any attempt at humor comes from a place of deep insecurity and ugliness. Well, you can describe a lot of comics like that though. It was all about your pain and ugliness becomes comedy. OK. That, in addition to a lack of self-awareness about that insecurity and ugliness. You have to be aware of it in order to be funny. And I just think that he’s not even remotely self-aware. And I don’t think he has joy in his life. I mean, I don’t know how you are supposed to bring joy to other people with humor if you actually don’t know what the experience of joy is. Because I don’t know if he knows what that is. So he’s not funny. But how would you describe the humor then? OK. So if I was writing — the tweet he wrote the other day about “60 Minutes,” and my magnificent answers to her horrible cues, like — I tweeted that. And I was like, I would love to write like this. Because if this was intentional, it would be hysterical. And he is unintentionally brilliant in his satire. [LAUGHS] It’s a really, actually really good. The quote where he’s like, “I’m really actually very humble. I don’t think how humble I am, but I am probably one of the most humble people you’ll ever meet,” no self awareness of the fact that what you just said is the least humble thing you could be saying. That type of irony is something that writers like aspire towards. But he’s nailed it without even trying. You know what I mean? Right. You could do a whole thing on his tweets by writing — I could do a whole thing on his tweets, the whole thing about how I’m like — you know, I’m a smart guy. I have a really good you know what. He forgot the word for brain while he was bragging about how smart he is. But that is brilliant comedy. You know what I mean? [LAUGHTER] (LAUGHING) Yeah, it is in a lot of ways. So do you draw the line at any Trump impressions? There’s moments you could have lip synced that are absurd — the spreading Covid misinformation, having Covid, all kinds of things. Is there anything you would not lip sync because it’s too horrifying to find humor in? Or is every— the policies on immigrant children, when he suggested the late Michigan Congressman John Dingell was looking up from hell. Is there anything that you decided not to do? Yeah, a lot of those things you mentioned. I mean, anything where — he fumbled some words during a Memorial Day service. And people were like, oh, you should do this because he can’t speak. But it’s still a Memorial Day service, so I’m not going to touch that. The thing he said about George Floyd being proud of what was happening, I’ll never do that. Anything that — He even said something, and I almost started to do it, about friends that he lost to Covid. But the way he said it was just like, yeah, he was a friend of mine. I guess he was a friend. I saw him a few times. You know, it was so obvious that it wasn’t a friend. And so it was a good thing to make fun of. But at the same time, there’s death involved, so I didn’t want to do it. So — Right. Right. Do you have to like someone when you’re doing an impression? Norm MacDonald doesn’t like Alec Baldwin’s Trump impression, which is the full-scale, dressed up, looking like and making the facial expressions. His philosophy was quote, “if you do an impression of someone, you have to like that person.” He says, “contempt alone doesn’t work.” Is there anything you like about Trump or not? Here’s the thing. I have imposter syndrome. And Trump has the opposite of imposter syndrome. I question everything I say. And he thinks everything he says is brilliant. And there is a part of me that would absolutely love that as a superpower. You know what I mean? To stop questioning everything I think and to actually have that confidence. And so I think that’s the difference between me and Alec Baldwin is Alec Baldwin very much hates him, but also, is at the same level powerwise as him. I’m not. And I feel like that’s where my sort of impression, which I don’t even think they’re really impressions, it comes from a different angle of just like, what if I could be up there where he is, and say whatever I want, and not be questioned, and still be praised? Is that why you think it’s effective? A lot of people talk about the juxtaposition of you being— you’re an immigrant woman from Jamaica. You’re a person of color. I think it is because of what you’re talking about is the power differential. And you hear him. For some reason, through you, you actually hear the ridiculousness of him. I mean, I think that’s the irony of it is just you see a Black woman speaking, and you’re a little bit more suspicious. And I kind of took advantage of that. And because you’re a little bit more suspicious, you’re actually listening to what he’s saying. You realize he’s saying it, not me. And you’re like, oh. So I feel like whether it’s power, or for some people, it very much is that he’s white, I’m Black. I think for a lot of people, that’s part of it. But no matter what it is, I look absolutely nothing like him. And I don’t try to look like him. And they like that. Would it play as well if it was a white male comic? They’ve tried it. It wouldn’t. It wouldn’t. It doesn’t. That’s the other thing is that I — for a while, I was like, what am I doing? Is this even special or anything like that? But then I look at other people trying to do what I do, and it does take some effort. You can’t just move your lips. There has to be a little bit more involved. And I do think it’s not as funny when a white guy is doing it. It just isn’t. The lips syncing, I mean. So many people are like, when they hear my real voice, they expect to hear Donald Trump’s voice. And I feel like the visual trick of convincing people that this voice was actually coming out of my mouth is something that takes some effort. Absolutely. Is there any trick that you use? Or do you think — I think it’s really just being convincing. It’s like acting in a silent movie and convincingly emoting, even though it’s not your voice. It is a silent movie. That’s a great way to think about it. So YouTube comments are surprisingly positive. I was looking at a bunch of them. I know, right. I don’t understand it. Right? I don’t have to write Susan. Me either. We’re just gay about that. But even the MAGA crowd likes you. Are they not getting the joke? I remember “Silicon Valley,” the HBO show. And I’d go to parties, and all the Silicon Valley guys goes, oh, that’s a great show. I’m like, that show hates you, whatever. What do you think is at work there? Yeah, it’s interesting hearing that from you. Because people do enjoy being roasted. You’re being roasted, but you like it somehow. I got — Because the attention’s on you. Yeah, I was roasted for my birthday, and I loved it. I feel like with — yeah, with them, I couldn’t — I think that they — They don’t hate you. They hate a lot of comics. They hate Michelle. There’s all kinds of comics, especially women comics, that get attacked by MAGA. I’m sure it’ll happen eventually. So I’m not looking forward to it. But right now, it’s — the biggest hit I get is that I’m a Boomer comedian, which I’ve been accused of being only for Boomers. Only Boomers like me, which I probably shouldn’t perpetuate. But on my special, I met Winona Ryder. And she came up to me. And she’s like, my mom loves you. So — [LAUGHTER] Maybe it’s true. Yeah, I want to get to your special in a second. But I want to finish this. So Trump is not a fan. Do you feel powerful knowing that you’ve been able to get under his skin? I kind of do because he was asked about my videos. And he pretended to not have seen them. And I think it genuinely bothers him that I’ve separated his voice from his physical presentation because I think he works very hard on— I’ve heard that he watches his interviews without sound because he thinks that people are all visual, and they’re not actually listening. So they’re really visual. If you look strong, and in control, and powerful, and you pretend like there’s a huge crowd when there’s no crowd that people will be convinced. And so the fact that I’ve taken that away, I think, really bothers him. Right. Right. Have you gotten anything from the group around him? Nothing. No. Nothing at all. Knock on wood. I haven’t gotten anything. And I think the MAGA crowd, I think that they either don’t see it as making fun of him, or they really like him so much, yeah, that they like the attention that he’s getting from it. Right. Yeah, that’s one thing. And you’ve called yourself the Trump whisperer. Why do you call yourself that? I’ve just started getting into his head a little bit. And the thing that I noticed recently as his discomfort around feminism and how he try— there’s one where he wants to say mailman. But then he was like, or mailwoman. The mailman. He’s trying to be a feminist, but it’s a thing that catches in his head or something. And then it’s so condescending when it comes out. It’s like or mailwoman. From the mailman and the mailwomen. Every single time, it’s so funny. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Sway. If you’re enjoying this conversation, hit Subscribe to catch up on episodes you’ve missed, and get each new episode delivered directly to you. More with Sarah Cooper when we come back. Election Day is coming up. Do you think you’ve done your last Trump TikTok? That’s a good question. I don’t think so. You think you’re not going to do anymore. Well, that’s what’s — well, what if, on the night of the election, he decides to give a speech accepting his win, despite the fact that he didn’t win, or we don’t know yet, or whatever. I don’t know. Maybe on the day that he’s— [BARKING] That’s your dog, right? That’s my dog. That’s OK. Ah, stop. [KISSES] So maybe on the day that Joe Biden is inaugurated, I’ll do that speech where he’s accepted his win or something like that. [LAUGHS] That’s a good one. So I know you won’t miss the muse. But are you tired of your muse? I’m very tired of him. He’s — you know the whole thing about how we have more cases because we test more? I did that video so many months ago. And people are like, do the one where he — and I’m like, he’s been saying the same thing. He says the same thing over and over and over again. So there’s — I don’t know what else there is. Now, one of the other things you’ve done is the political impact of your comedy. Now, political scientists found that Tina Fey’s Palin impression made Republican and Independent supporters Sarah Palin less attractive to them as a candidate. Are you — do you think you’re changing the minds of Republicans and Independents or just playing to an echo chamber? I think that, yes, there was an echo chamber. But there are people who had checked out who checked back in because of my videos. I think that that probably happened. And hopefully, it got them to realize what the hell was going on if they were missing it. So I don’t know if I changed their minds so much as I made them a little bit more involved with what was going on. I don’t think I changed the mind of any — any Trump supporter, no. They might be able to laugh at my video, but they’re still going to vote for Trump. I don’t think I really changed anybody’s minds there. So what do you want to do next? Talk about what you’re doing with this new Netflix show, which is called “Everything is Fine.” “Everything’s Fine.” “Everything’s Fine,” which is the famous life in hell kind of thing. So explain — describe what you’re doing. Because it’s not standup. I was trying to figure out what it was last night when I was watching it. It’s not — You saw It? Yes, of course I did. Oh my god. You have so many celebrities. I’m like, oh, no, there’s Winona Ryder under the desk. How did she show up? That was a shocker, I have to tell you. And then Marisa Tomei. And you’re in bed with Jon Hamm. All of a sudden — talk about what you’re doing. Because it’s not standup. So what did — how did you conceive of “Everything’s Fine?” Yeah, I mean — I was just thinking about how we’re just inundated with news now. And everyone’s so glued to the news and what’s happening because we’re living in this crazy world where something crazy happens every second. So I just had this idea of this morning show anchor who basically has a breakdown and ends up under the desk. [MUSIC PLAYING] This story is about Sarah Cooper, who was a Morning News anchor from the spring of 2017 to the fall of 2020. At her peak, Cooper had a HUT rating of 54 and a 27 audience share. She looks all right here. But inside, she’s losing her mind. I knew I wanted to do a sketch special because doing standup right now without an audience would suck. But I wanted it to feel like “Mr. Show” because that’s one of my favorite sketch shows. And so I just had this idea to do this sort of overarching story with this morning show anchor, but then have sketches throughout. And so — Commercials and things like that. Yeah, parody commercials. Just have it feel kind of like one thing and be surprising and just something that you have trouble describing, like you don’t even really know what it is, to be able to be a morning show anchor, and then have Trump call in, and Trump is me, and have me — just stuff like that where there is no format, really. And you’re seeing behind the scenes because Fred Armisen is behind the scenes as my producer. And — So what were you trying to get through in it? Because some of it — at the end, I was quite uncomfortable, I have to say, especially the Helen Mirren part. For some reason, that exchange was so disturbing. Yeah. Helen Mirren and you are talking about attacking women, essentially, which was really, really disturbing. I have to say, that particular scene — you’re in the bus. You’re in an actual bus. And she got into it heavy. She was playing— what’s that guy? What’s the guy who was — Billy Bush. Right, Billy Bush. Yeah. It’d better not be the publicist. No, it’s her. Yeah, that’s her, with the gold. I gotta use some Tic-Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. [LAUGHS] You just kiss. I don’t even — and you’re a star, they let you do it. [LAUGHS] You just kiss. You just kiss. You can do anything. Whatever you want. Talk about where you were going ‘cause I think you were trying to make people uncomfortable in the sketch show. Well, I mean, I was trying to encapsulate what 2020 has been. And what 2020 has been is just something that you can’t really describe. It’s been very unpredictable, very disconcerting. Everyone feels like they’re not sure what the future is going to hold. Is it a time capsule? Or is this going to be our life? So I think that that’s kind of what I was going for, something that’s just unpredictable and just makes you feel a little — you know, just seen in terms of like, this is what we’re all going through. When you have the title “Everything’s Fine,” do you think everything’s fine? No. [LAUGHS] It is not fine. Everything’s not fine. And the more we say that everything’s fine when it’s not, the worse things get. So I think it’s about being honest about the fact that no, this isn’t fine. So I did get the right impression from your show. Everything’s not fine. Everything is not fine. When you think about where we’re going, one of the things I think about is the impact that Trump has had on culture, the larger impact. Mm-hmm. Give me your thoughts of what you think that will mean. Because everything is about him. Not just comedy is about him, the news. Everything is reacting to whatever idiotic thing he said that day. A lot of good things happened to you that wouldn’t have been possible without him. Right. Does it ever give you cognitive dissonance to have this happen? This is a terrible year, and your show is about the terrible year. Yeah, I mean, it does. I always — when I looked at YouTube influencers, I always thought that when you die, in your obituary, they’re going to mention YouTube. So [LAUGHS] the fact that in my obituary, Trump will probably be mentioned, TikTok will probably be mentioned, these things that — I absolutely hate Trump. So I mean, yeah, I don’t even know if I would have broken through had it not been for this. And I think that that’s the beauty of the internet is because you can — everyone can share something. And if enough people like it, and enough people want more of it, it can legitimize you in a way that nothing else can. So I mean, I owe a lot of my success to going viral on the internet. So it lets people like me, who don’t look like the standard form of a Hollywood starlet, be able to break through and become not only an actress, but a writer, and a producer, and all of the things that I want to do. So I highly recommend checking out the internet, if you haven’t checked it out yet. [LAUGHTER] Yeah, it’s the ethernets, the internets. The kids love it. The kids love it, apparently. What do you want to do next? What do what think — what comedy appeals to you? TV. TV. TV. TV. I want to do TV. Would you like to be on a show like “SNL,” for example? As a performer? Yeah. As a host, yes. Yeah, as a host, OK. [LAUGHS] Oh, aim high, Sarah Cooper. Ensemble stuff, forget it. Screw that. I would have loved to have been on “SNL” as a cast member a year ago. But now, I have other things that I really wanted to do. So — Oh, wow. [LAUGHS] I mean, it is so thrilling to me to take something like— there’s a chapter in my book called “How to be Harassed without Hurting His Career.” And that’s what a lot of women have gone through. It’s just like you need to be harassed by the right person at the right time. Don’t get harassed by the C.E.O. because then you are [expletive]. You know? To take that and to write a story around it, and put characters in, and have people experience that, and tell a story is just so exciting and thrilling to me. So that just feels like the next phase of this is to be able to take my cartoons that maybe turned into these 60-second videos, and turn it into a full series. It’s just being able to take up more space and say more. The essence is the same. but being able to explore it from so many different angles and give people that experience is really exciting to me. So what about — when you think about TV, you don’t think the internet is where you want to make your comedy. I mean, I guess when I say TV, I just mean a series with characters that people follow. I don’t know what platform that is. But it’s — Well, look, Quibi’s gone. I’m sorry to tell you. I don’t if you’ve heard. [Expletive] What? [LAUGHTER] I’m making everything for Quibi. Goddamn. Did you have a Quibi deal? I didn’t. And I’m so glad I didn’t. I was — But at the beginning of the year, that’s what I wanted. Right, right, right. Now, you don’t. But it doesn’t seem to work on the internet. These TV networks don’t seem to work on the internet for some reason. They’re going to figure it out. And you know what. I think you and me, we’re going to start a media company, like a real one. OK. All right. And then it’s going to take the entertainment that you might find on television, and we’re going to combine it with the essence of the internet that makes things successful there, and it’s going to be amazing. Oh, I like that. So how do you make money? How are you making money now? Is there any money you’ve made on the Trump videos? Twitter is very far behind YouTube in terms of being able to monetize. But I was able to make thousands of dollars on YouTube. Thousands. OK. Yeah, I would take the TikToks and post them on YouTube, same format. Oh, YouTube, OK. And I would monetize those with ads. But Twitter I wasn’t able to monetize. And I got the most views on Twitter, so I left the most money on the table at Twitter. Right. So you made no money on those. No. And is that thousands per video? Or all of the videos, you made thousands? Oh, you want to know exactly how much I made. Yeah, I do. I do. Oh my god. So you want to know. I’ll tell you how much I made for the person, man, woman, TV video. Which you put on YouTube from TikTok. “How To Person, Woman, Man, Camera, TV” revenue, estimated revenue, lifetime estimated revenue, $19,463.72 Wow. So that’s how much YouTube paid me for that video. Hmm. And 0 on Twitter. And 0 on Twitter. Yeah. I guess you don’t want to tell me your Netflix salary. So you don’t have to. Don’t worry. I’m not going to ask. I’m not get— So when you think about what you — if everything fell apart — you’ve had so many opportunities this year. I don’t think that’s going to be the case — Which internet company would you go back to work for? Ooh, good question. Yeah, I’m full of them, Sarah. Which internet company? I’d go back to Google. Yeah. Would you? Yeah, absolutely. Which internet company would you not work for? Besides Facebook? Yeah. I got that. I got that impression. Probably Etsy because I think it should be “Eetsy,” and I wouldn’t be able to work there because I’d just keep mispronouncing the name of the company. [LAUGHS] I am going to ask you one last question. When you look at someone like Kamala Harris and others, if Biden wins, is this a funny administration? No, it’s boring. Yeah. It’s very boring. Yeah. But we have to stay engaged because my biggest regret is not voting in 2010. Obama won. It was amazing. And I think I checked out. I think a ton of people just checked out. And so it’s not going to be interesting. It’s not going to be exciting. Trump will hopefully be off doing something that we can laugh at because it won’t be affecting us. But Biden and Harris are going to be very, very boring. And hopefully they will get a lot done because hopefully Democrats will take all of the branches. So that’s what I hope. Boring, but I’m still going to be engaged. Is there a Biden impression? No. I don’t think so. You don’t think — is there any politician? Pick a politician, not Trump. If you had to pick one. Or anybody, anybody. Hannity. Hannity. Yeah, any Fox News anchor. Yeah, any — if you watch Fox News now, it’s the best satire on television because it’s people who have brains rationally defending the absolutely irrational. And it’s complete satire. So any of them. Elon Musk I did, and I will always enjoy because he’s ridiculous. Any — somebody called it reverse mansplaining. And so anybody who mansplains a lot, and I can show them how smug they sound will be fun. OK, well, then, there’s — you’ve got a career for the rest of your life, I think. The rest of my life. The rest of your life. Sarah, thank you so much. And good luck with the special. Thank you. And good luck with everything you’re doing. Thank you so much. And say hi to your husband. I will. All right, thanks, Sarah. Bye. [MUSIC PLAYING] “Sway” is a production of New York Times Opinion. Is produced by Nayeema Raza, Heba Elorbany, Matt Kwong, and Vishakha Darbha.

As the most powerful man in the country peddled hydroxychloroquine and disinfectant snake oil as cures for the coronavirus, the comedian Sarah Cooper scoured her kitchen cabinet for props, scouted her lockdown apartment for locations and angled her iPhone. The result: a series of lip-sync videos posted on TikTok and Twitter — and viewed by millions. The viral clips starred her facial expressions and the president’s voice. But Ms. Cooper’s voice quickly followed. She soon nabbed a headliner spot at the Democratic National Convention. Months later, she’s the star of the celebrity-packed Netflix special “Everything’s Fine.” Ms. Cooper says, “My success is forever linked to this person that I absolutely hate.” But she hopes that after Nov. 3, she can put Trump behind her. This episode contains strong language. Times Opinion has teamed up with Kara Swisher on a new podcast about power and influence.
