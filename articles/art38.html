Round 7: Jones opens up and Tyson comes back. Round 6: Tyson definitely went after that K.O. a few times. Round 5: Tyson is opening up. Round 4: More of the same. Round 3: Jones has a smart plan, at least. Round 2: Sugar Ray Leonard calls it ‚Äúshake and bake.‚Äù Round 1: Action and clinching. Lets talk about this surprisingly good production value. Nate Robinson had a strategy, kind of. Jake Paul saw it and knocked him out. Explain to me again how these fights are legit. Yeah, that Badou Jack fight was pretty lopsided (for a decision). Jamaine Ortiz won in the ring and is winning on Instagram. Edward Vasquez won the first fight of the night. Trump could end up a part of this and it would actually make sense. Are these fights real? Who‚Äôs bankrolling this spectacle? By Kevin Draper For about 30 seconds there, it looked like both boxers were going to go all out in the final round, but then reality set in. ‚ÄúNot a battle of the ages, but a battle of the aged,‚Äù the announcer quipped. Tyson looks like he could go a couple more rounds, while Jones looked done a couple of rounds ago. Tyson got some shots in, while Jones got maybe one. Tyson won the round, and should have won the fight. The three celebrity fighting judges scored the fight a draw. Why a draw, and not a split decision? Were the judges actual scoring the fight for real, or just having some fun? Was it decided even before the fight that it would be a draw? Who knows, and who cares? Mike Tyson fought Roy Jones Jr. in 2020, everybody had fun and nobody got seriously hurt. A draw seems appropriate. By Morgan Campbell Jones opened this round with a salvo, bouncing lefts and rights off Tyson‚Äôs dome. The offense didn‚Äôt deter Tyson, who pressed forward with big lefts and rights. So Jones opened up again, pelting Tyson with another flurry of punches. The first round Jones won definitively. But seven rounds in we haven‚Äôt had a serious injury, so they‚Äôre both winners in that sense. By Kevin Draper Since this is technically an exhibition there isn‚Äôt supposed to be a knockout, but Tyson threw a couple of punches midway through the round that had lights out intent. They just missed Jones. Besides that, a lot of clenching. Jones landed one clean shot near the end of the round. By Morgan Campbell Tyson looks fresher. He landed a right hand to the body early, and several left hooks upstairs as the round progressed. Jones is still clinching, still looking to force Tyson to carry his weight, but Jones is fading fast. Between rounds he slumped in his corner, grimacing and breathing heavily while his cornermen doused him with water. By Kevin Draper More of the same: Any time Tyson got close, Jones wrapped him up as quickly as possible, even being warned by the referee at one point. Jones showed a bit of an attacking strategy, trying to catch Tyson surprised with unconventional footwork and a quick jab or two, but it didn‚Äôt particularly work. When he wasn‚Äôt being grabbed, Tyson landed a couple of right-handed hammers to the body. By Morgan Campbell Jones is deep into his game plan for this fight: lean on Tyson, walk him back if possible, and make him tired. A solid strategy if you‚Äôre fighting a 54-year-old, but not quite as foolproof if you‚Äôre 51, as Jones is. Tyson threw the heavier blows. Jones threw the faster punches. Neither fighter landed many clean shots. Lots of heavy breathing though. By Kevin Draper Tyson opened the second round by immediately exploding into Jones, with Jones quickly grabbing him to slow things down, much like the first round. Tyson landed the biggest shot of the night so far 30 seconds into the round, a strong left to Jones‚Äôs face. There was a bit of extracurricular activity after the bell, and for a second it looked like there was some animosity. But then the fighters remembered it was an exhibition and hugged each other.       Roy Jones trainer: Make turns quicker By Morgan Campbell Tyson started fast, bobbing, weaving, jabbing, hooking, and missing. Jones started quickly, too ‚Äî moving feinting, jabbing, and missing. Eventually the two faded fighters fell into a clinch, one of several that defined the first round. By Kevin Draper Nate Robinson got absolutely dominated by Jake Paul, getting knocked down three times en route to his knockout loss. Robinson‚Äôs former teammates and opponents in the N.B.A. all seemed to tune in. Nick Young was disappointed: That was no representation of the NBA Family lol Stephen Curry was concerned ‚Ä¶ Be ok Nate......come on man. ‚Ä¶ while Andre Iguodala replied to him with a ‚ÄúFriday‚Äù reference. Cmon Craig!!! Bradley Beal got dragged into a meme: Dawg üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ https://t.co/Qdp532Qcf6 And Markieff Morris had the wisest tweet of the night: Boxing ain‚Äôt that sport to play with!! By Kevin Draper Perhaps the biggest surprise of the night? The production value of the stream is actually pretty good. Even with a $49.99 pay-per-view price, an event on Fite TV sponsored by Triller and Weedmaps doesn‚Äôt necessarily scream professional. The quality of a phone pointed at a television screen would not have been too unexpected. But these fights actually look great. There is a lighting grid right above the ring ‚Äî which probably wouldn‚Äôt work outside of the pandemic because it would block the view of fans ‚Äî that is shining directly onto the fighters. All other lights are off, giving the fights a cinematic feel, like a better version of how the Barclays Center is lit for Brooklyn Nets games. The camera work is also quite different from normal. The main camera seems to be both lower and closer than usual, and it is never still, slowly panning as if it is being shot by a drone. There are no camera operators on the posts, but additional cameras are on jibs for close-up and alternate angles. Most professional sporting events this summer and fall suffered from being played in cavernous venues that often felt lifeless without fans. But this feels like something completely different, a production wholly conceived of during the pandemic that takes advantage of no fans rather than suffers for it. Boxing purists might not like it. The moving camera may cause queasiness. The look wouldn‚Äôt be out of place in a boxing video game. But at least it is different and interesting. By Morgan Campbell The former Knicks basketball player Nate Robinson entered the fight with a stark speed advantage over the YouTube star Jake Paul, and Robinson showed it off repeatedly, sprinting across the ring throwing wild punches before falling into a clinch. When the referee would separate the two novice fighters ‚Äî combined pro boxing experience: one bout ‚Äî Robinson would back off and then run in again. And again. And again. Paul isn‚Äôt a craftsman, but he has spent the last year training with boxers, including Floyd Mayweather prot√©g√© J‚ÄôLeon Love. So even if he‚Äôll never contend for a title, or even beat a full-time boxer, he‚Äôs boxed enough to recognize a pattern. So late in Round 1, when Robinson rushed straight in, Paul clipped him with a right hand to the back of the head for the fight‚Äôs first knockdown. In the second, Robinson still hadn‚Äôt varied his tactics, so Paul had no reason to do anything besides try to time him with a big right hand. And it happened. Twice. The first one dropped Robinson, but the 37-year-old beat the referee‚Äôs count. The second one deposited Robinson flat on his face, midway through the second round, ending the fight, and sparing us four more rounds of rushing, clinching and mauling. By Kevin Draper The California State Athletic Commission, which regulates all fights in the state, has been down this road before. Last year, about this time, the agency sanctioned a fight between Logan Paul and KSI, two YouTube stars who had fought once before, in London. Calling them amateur fighters is both accurate and insulting to real amateur fighters who train and fight for years. But deciding whether or not to permit a bout between two YouTubers wasn‚Äôt particularly difficult. As Andy Foster, the executive officer of the commission, explained it, the basic goal is to make sure all fights are safe, allowing for the fact that the two fighters are trying to pummel each other in the face. Two physically matched, mostly unskilled YouTube stars is a safe, even match, even if it doesn‚Äôt sound particularly compelling. By that token, Mike Tyson and Roy Jones Jr., both in their 50s and former professional fighters who know exactly what they are doing are, well, professionals. Record-wise, the fight will not count; it is considered an exhibition. But every other fight will, including the one between Nate Robinson, the former N.B.A. player, and Jake Paul, the YouTube star and brother of the aforementioned Logan Paul. By Morgan Campbell Late in Round 1, 33-year-old prospect Blake McKernan landed a right hand to Badou Jack‚Äôs head, the kind of clean punch that wins the Sacramento, Calif., native respect and room to operate when he‚Äôs fighting the kind of guys that fill out his 13-0 record. But Jack isn‚Äôt a journeyman like Alfredo Contreras or Miguel Cubos. He‚Äôs a former world champ at 168 and 175 pounds, and he absorbed the shot without blinking, which made sense. That punch was McKernan‚Äôs only connection in the opening round. Jack landed 16 times. The remaining seven rounds were only marginally more competitive. Jack stalked McKernan and landed every variety of punch ‚Äî jabs, right hands, lefts and rights to the body. McKernan retreated and chose his spots to counterattack, but Jack overwhelmed him. Every judge scored every round for Jack, who improved to 23-3-3, and now hopes for another title fight against Jean Pascal, who defeated him last December. McKernan left the bout with his first loss and a hematoma above his right eye. By Morgan Campbell Midway through his victory over rugged lightweight Sulaiman Segawa, 24-year-old Jamaine Ortiz boasted roughly 5,700 Instagram followers. By the time Ortiz finished off Segawa to seal a seventh-round technical knockout victory, that figure had jumped by more than 1,000. And by the time rappers French Montana and Swae Lee launched into their post-fight medley, Ortiz‚Äô Instagram following had cracked five figures. By that metric, Ortiz, a smooth switch-hitter who improved his record to 14-0, recorded one of the biggest wins of the evening, captivating casual fans and drive-by viewers with his performance and converting them into fans of his own. Anybody wondering whether this card would feature real fights should thank the matchmakers, because Ortiz-Segawa was as competitive and fast-paced and violent and skilled as the featherweight bout preceding it. Segawa, a southpaw slugger who fights out of Silver Spring, Md., actually outlanded Ortiz 129-121, but Ortiz connected on the bout‚Äôs definitive blow ‚Äî a left hook to the rib cage that dropped Segawa to a knee. He beat the count, but Ortiz unloaded a series of shots, prompting referee Ray Corona to stop the fight. By Kevin Draper Even among the surreal and larger-than-life characters that have populated the boxing world over the years, Mike Tyson stands out. Might the closest comparison be one of the greatest soccer players ever, and Tyson‚Äôs friend, the recently passed Diego Maradona? ‚ÄúThe Hand of God, Maradona has left us,‚Äù Tyson tweeted on Wednesday. ‚ÄúIn 86 we both won our championships. They use to compare the two of us. He was one of my hero‚Äôs and a friend. I respected him so much. He will be greatly missed.‚Äù The Hand of God, Maradona has left us.  In 86 we both won our championships.  They use to compare the two of us.  He was one of my hero‚Äôs and a friend.  I respected him so much.  He will be greatly missed. pic.twitter.com/E5j6DSfJas Tyson made an appearance on the Argentine talk show Maradona hosted in the mid-2000s, where he compared their upbringings. ‚ÄúThe important thing is that people like us, who come from the same place we do, have always fought to get where we are,‚Äù he told Maradona. Both Tyson and Maradona were athletically gifted, both have suffered from personal demons and both spent about as many years remembered as a punchline as they were remembered for their athletic prowess. Maradona mostly harmed himself ‚Äî he was addicted to cocaine and abused alcohol ‚Äî but he also was accused of domestic abuse and said to have associations with organized crime. Tyson often harmed others outside of the ring, and was sentenced to prison for rape. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
