Live Updates: Cuomo Expands Mail-In Voting in New York<br></h1><p id="artcont">RIGHT NOW Pelosi endorses Joe Kennedy over Ed Markey in Senate race in Massachusetts. New York expands mail-in voting amid virus fears. After three nights of buildup, it’s time for Joe Biden to stand on his own. Steve Bannon, Trump’s former top adviser, is arrested on fraud charges over border wall fund-raising. Obama’s takedown of Trump was a dire warning of the risks facing democracy. A judge in New York rules again that Trump must produce his tax returns. How it felt inside the empty hall where Kamala Harris accepted the V.P. nomination. The N.A.A.C.P. sues the Postal Service over mail slowdowns ahead of the election. New York State will allow most voters to cast their ballots by mail in the November general election, joining a growing list of states that have expanded mail-in voting to address the potential spread of the coronavirus at polling places. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, signed a bill on Thursday allowing voters to request an absentee ballot if they cannot show up at a polling location because of the risk of contracting or spreading an illness, effectively permitting the state’s more than 12 million registered voters to vote by mail. Mail-in voting has expanded during the pandemic over the objections of President Trump, who has repeatedly made false claims that the practice leads to widespread fraud. At the same time, recent cutbacks at the Postal Service have slowed delivery and drawn heated condemnation and a bevy of lawsuits, and led to questions about its capacity to handle a crush of mail-in ballots. While all voters will receive absentee ballots in at least nine states, including New Jersey and California, New York’s system will be different: Voters will have to request mail-in ballots, either online, by phone, in person or by mail. The ballots can be requested  immediately and will be counted if they are postmarked by Election Day. “The federal administration has ordered an unprecedented attack on the U.S. Postal Service and with Covid-19 threatening our ability to have safe, in-person voting, these measures are critical to ensuring a successful and fair election at one of the most important moments in our nation’s history,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. On Wednesday, the Trump campaign sued New Jersey over that state’s decision to conduct the November election almost entirely by mail. Mr. Trump has also cited difficulties with mail-in ballots in several primaries in New York City. Though there has been no evidence that the primary results were marred by criminal malfeasance, the mishandling of tens of thousands of ballots delayed results in key races. Despite railing against mail-in voting, Mr. Trump and the first lady both requested mail-in ballots this month from Florida. The president has suggested Florida’s mail voting system is sound because it had “a great Republican governor” in Ron DeSantis, a Trump ally. — Luis Ferré-Sadurní, Michael Gold and Michael Cooper We have heard from the heroes of the Democratic Party’s past. We have heard from several leaders who may represent its future, including Senator Kamala Harris, the vice-presidential nominee. On the final night of the convention, the spotlight will finally turn to the man who is the party’s present, Joseph R. Biden Jr. Even with the awkward limitations of a virtual convention, the programming of the last three nights has built steadily and more or less smoothly toward the unveiling of Mr. Biden as a president-in-waiting. It now falls to Mr. Biden to fill the political silhouette his party has gradually sketched — one that frames him as a steady hand for difficult times, capable of bringing concrete relief to people suffering through a crisis. TRANSCRIPT “Hey, everybody, it’s me, Kamala.” “Tonight we are going to hear from so many phenomenal women who are working to help us build that more perfect union.” “Tonight I’m thinking of the girls and boys who see themselves in America’s future because of Kamala Harris — a black woman, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, and our nominee for vice president. This is our country’s story: breaking down barriers and expanding the circle of possibility.” ♫ “I’m in love with my future, and you don’t know ...” ♫ “Donald Trump’s ignorance and incompetence have always been a danger to our country. Covid-19 was Trump’s biggest test. He failed miserably. Today America has the most Covid deaths in the world and an economic collapse.” “My mom worked hard and paid taxes, and the Obama administration told her she could stay. My dad thought you would protect military families. So he voted for you in 2016, Mr. President. He says he won’t vote for you again after what you did to our family.” “The wife of a U.S. Marine veteran was deported to Mexico.” “Instead of protecting us, you tore our world apart.” “My mom is a good person, and she’s not a criminal.” “Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job, because he can’t. And the consequences of that failure are severe: 170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone, while those at the top take in more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before. But more than anything, what I know about Joe, what I know about Kamala, is that they actually care about every American, and that they care deeply about this democracy. They believe that in a democracy, the right to vote is sacred, and we should be making it easier for people to cast their ballots, not harder. They understand that in this democracy, the commander in chief does not use the men and women of our military, who are willing to risk everything to protect our nation, as political props to deploy against peaceful protesters on our own soil. This president and those in power, those who benefit from keeping things the way they are, they are counting on your cynicism. They know they can’t win you over with their policies. So they’re hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote does not matter.” “With only one nomination received and pursuant to our rules, I hereby declare that Kamala Harris is elected as the Democratic candidate for vice president.” “She is the first black woman, first South Asian woman to be named on the Democratic ticket.” “This is a historic pick.” “Someone who looks like us on a presidential ticket, that’s crazy.” “That I am here tonight is a testament to the dedication of generations before me: women and men who believed so fiercely in the promise of equality, liberty and justice for all. This week marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment. And we celebrate the women who fought for that right. Yet so many of the Black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting long after its ratification. But they were undeterred. Without fanfare or recognition, they organized and testified and rallied and marched and fought, not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table. My mother taught me that service to others gives life purpose and meaning. And oh, how I wish she were here tonight, but I know she’s looking down on me from above. I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman, all of five feet tall, who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, Calif. On that day she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now and speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America. Make no mistake: The road ahead is not easy. We may stumble. We may fall short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly and deal with our challenges honestly. We will speak truths, and we will act with the same faith in you that we ask you to place in us. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.” [music and applause] In the 2020 campaign, Mr. Biden has seldom been the most eloquent advocate for his own cause. In the most important moments of his campaign, he has leaned heavily on other, more magnetic and fluid speakers: James E. Clyburn in the days before the South Carolina primary, and Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg before the Super Tuesday contests in March. He will have help again tonight, from allies who will address the audience before him, including Mr. Buttigieg, Andrew Yang and Senator Tammy Duckworth. But if ever there were a moment for Mr. Biden to stand on his own, this is it. President Trump seems to have done his best this week to tee up a major political opportunity for his challenger, making admiring comments about believers in the conspiracy theory QAnon and calling for Americans to shun Goodyear, the Ohio tire company, because of its restrictions on political attire in the workplace. Mr. Biden’s critique of the president appears as salient as ever — he just has to deliver it. Over his near half-century in public life, Mr. Biden has made good speeches, bad speeches, campaign kickoff speeches and concession speeches, speeches without proper attribution to original sources, speeches so impossibly Biden that no one could ever accuse him of lifting anything. “No one ever doubts that I mean what I say,” Mr. Biden, 77, is fond of telling audiences. “The problem is, I sometimes say all that I mean.” For tonight’s speech, he conferred with family, friends, trusted strategists and others he admires, including Jon Meacham, the presidential historian, whose recent book “The Soul of America” has been echoed by Mr. Biden throughout his presidential bid. — Alexander Burns, Katie Glueck and Matt Flegenheimer Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s former top adviser, was charged on Thursday in New York with fraud for his role in a scheme related to an online fund-raising effort that collected more than $25 million for Mr. Trump’s much-touted plan to build a wall along the Mexican border, officials said. Mr. Bannon and other defendants connected to the “We Build the Wall” campaign “defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors, capitalizing on their interest in funding a border wall to raise millions of dollars, under the false pretense that all of that money would be spent on construction,” Audrey Strauss, the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. Mr. Bannon was arrested early Thursday in Connecticut by U.S. postal inspectors and brought to Manhattan where he faced charges in a two-count indictment unsealed in Federal District Court. He was expected to appear before a U.S. magistrate judge in New York later in the day. According to federal authorities, Mr. Bannon, 66, who was widely considered the architect of Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, hatched the plot to defraud donors with three other men, including Brian Kolfage, an Air Force veteran who founded “We Build the Wall.” Mr. Kolfage promised donors that all money raised would be used “in the execution of our mission and purpose,” but instead, he took more than $350,000 in donations for his own personal use, prosecutors said. Mr. Bannon, through an unnamed nonprofit organization, received more than $1 million from “We Build the Wall,” prosecutors said, some of which he used pay off hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal expenses. Mr. Bannon, who rose to prominence at the conservative news site Breitbart News, accompanied Mr. Trump to the White House in 2017 and became his chief strategist. But he was pushed out within a year, after clashing with the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, her husband and Mr. Trump’s senior adviser. — Alan Feuer and William K. Rashbaum TRANSCRIPT Tonight I want to talk as plainly as I can about the stakes in this election — because what we do these next 76 days will echo through generations to come. I have sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president. I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope for the sake of our country that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously, that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care. But he never did. For close to four years now, he has shown no interest in putting in the work, no interest in finding common ground, no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends, no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves. Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job, because he can’t. And the consequences of that failure are severe. This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down, if that’s what it takes for them to win. So we have to get busy building it up — by pouring all our efforts into these 76 days and by voting like never before: for Joe and Kamala and candidates up and down the ticket, so that we leave no doubt about what this country that we love stands for. If President Trump has subjected his predecessor to a thousand paper cuts on Twitter, former President Barack Obama responded on Wednesday night with one grand rhetorical saber stroke, offering one of the most comprehensive denunciations of one president by another in American history. Mr. Obama’s address for the Democratic National Convention painted a dire picture of the country under Mr. Trump, portraying his successor as a man unfit, uncaring and unserious, who threatens both the nation’s welfare and its core democratic institutions. “This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that’s what it takes to win,” Mr. Obama, hair grayed and manner grave, said in one of the most emotional speeches he has ever delivered. The former president, who has cast aside his initial reluctance to engage with Mr. Trump, created a concise indictment of a president who has ridiculed him personally, leveled racist attacks against him and sought to erase any trace of Mr. Obama’s policy legacy since taking power. “I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously; that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care,” said Mr. Obama, speaking from the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia — not far from Independence Hall, where he delivered a far more upbeat address on racial issues in 2008. “But he never did,” the former president went on. “He’s shown no interest in putting in the work; no interest in finding common ground; no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends; no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves. Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t.” As Mr. Obama spoke, Mr. Trump responded with two tweets in all-caps, first repeating the baseless claim that the former president had spied on his 2016 campaign, then asking why Mr. Obama had not endorsed Joseph R. Biden Jr. until the Democratic primary was effectively over. — Glenn Thrush A federal judge on Thursday rejected President Trump’s latest effort to block the Manhattan district attorney from obtaining his tax returns, dismissing Mr. Trump’s arguments that the prosecutor’s grand jury subpoena was “wildly overbroad” and issued in bad faith. The ruling, by Judge Victor Marrero of Federal District Court in Manhattan, is the latest turn in a yearlong fight over the subpoena, which has already reached the Supreme Court once and could end up there again if, as expected, Mr. Trump appeals. The district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a Democrat, has been seeking eight years of Mr. Trump’s personal and business returns and other financial records as part of an investigation into the president’s business practices. The Supreme Court, in a landmark decision in July, rejected Mr. Trump’s argument that a sitting president was immune from criminal investigation. But the ruling allowed the president to return to the lower court and raise other objections to the subpoena. It has been known that Mr. Vance was investigating whether New York State laws were broken when hush-money payments were made in the run-up to the 2016 election to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump. Earlier this month, Mr. Vance’s office suggested it was investigating the president and his company for possible bank and insurance fraud, a significantly broader inquiry than prosecutors had acknowledged in the past. — Benjamin Weiser and William K. Rashbaum WILMINGTON, Del. — At long last, after a bruising primary campaign and months of suspense, a senator from the nation’s largest state stood on a stage in one of the nation’s smallest and uttered 13 remarkable words: “I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America.” It was the pinnacle of Kamala Harris’s political career. And no one made a sound. For nearly 19 minutes on Wednesday, Ms. Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, experienced a politician’s dream, turned upside-down by a country’s nightmare. With the coronavirus pandemic prompting Democrats to hold a virtual convention, Ms. Harris accepted her party’s nomination not in front of a jubilant crowd, but in a quiet exhibit hall with about 30 journalists on hand. The site of this grand moment was the Chase Center on the Riverfront, along the Christina River in Wilmington. Earlier this year, it hosted a bridal expo and a model train show, but on Wednesday it became the epicenter of Democratic politics, not that anyone would have wished for that. This was supposed to be Milwaukee’s honor, with the Democratic ticket appearing before thousands in the arena that is home to the Milwaukee Bucks. Milwaukee did get a consolation prize: The press credentials in Delaware showed the Milwaukee Art Museum. There were some familiar sights for a convention, including a heavy law enforcement presence and television crews. But there were no swarms of people and no packed schedule of events and parties — though the restaurant in the adjacent hotel did offer specials like a Constitution Burger and Red, White and Blueberry Panna Cotta. Inside the exhibit hall was an imposing stage, with huge video screens and American flags as a backdrop. Reporters, who had been tested for Covid-19, wore masks and sat distanced from each other, among the state delegation signs that are a staple of political conventions. Ms. Harris stood onstage in darkness awaiting her moment to speak. Around 10:50 p.m., the lights went up and it was time. There would be no applause or cheers as she spoke, just like last week, when Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Ms. Harris made their debut as a ticket in a high school gymnasium with only journalists in attendance. But when she finished, music played — “Work That” by Mary J. Blige — and there was a virtual approximation of a crowd: A screen behind the lectern showed a grid of cheering supporters. Ms. Harris turned to them and waved. Mr. Biden soon joined her (at a distance) onstage, along with their respective spouses. If the lack of spectators bothered them, they did not show it. — Thomas Kaplan Democrats formally nominated Senator Kamala Harris for the vice presidency on Wednesday night, placing a woman of color on a major party ticket for the first time and showcasing the diversity of race and gender they believe will energize their coalition to defeat President Trump in the fall. A day after nominating Joseph R. Biden Jr., a 77-year-old fixture of Washington establishment politics, Democrats tried to make the case that while Mr. Biden would be one kind of change agent — a repudiation of Trumpism — Ms. Harris would help steer the party in new directions and reflect a changing America. Speeches by former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Speaker Nancy Pelosi were intended to underscore the history-making moment of Ms. Harris’s nomination, highlighting her uniquely American biography: A child of immigrants and a graduate of a historically Black university, she is one of the few women of color elected to the United States Senate. “We’re at an inflection point,” Ms. Harris said as she formally accepted the nomination. “The constant chaos leaves us adrift. The incompetence makes us feel afraid. The callousness makes us feel alone.” “We can do better and deserve so much more,” she continued. “We must elect a president who will bring something different, something better and do the important work.” Far more than the two previous nights, which centered on testimonials to Mr. Biden’s character and empathy, Night 3 focused on policy, addressing issues like gun violence, climate change, affordable child care and immigration. In videos, activists promoted Mr. Biden’s plans to tackle a warming planet, and survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence reminded viewers of his role in crafting the Violence Against Women Act. The American child of a deported undocumented mother begged the president to reunite families torn apart by his immigration policy. In perhaps the most policy-heavy speech of the evening, Ms. Warren, speaking from an early childhood learning center in her home state, Massachusetts, praised Mr. Biden’s “really good plans.” She highlighted his proposals to make child care more affordable, to provide universal preschool and to raise wages for child care workers. Much of the evening was devoted to the power of women in politics. To mark the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote, Ms. Pelosi and Mrs. Clinton, two of the most influential women in politics, wore white in their appearances this week, in tribute to the suffragists. In their remarks, both anointed Ms. Harris as a successor of sorts, though they had declined to endorse her or any of the other five women who sought the Democratic presidential nomination. — Astead W. Herndon and Lisa Lerer The N.A.A.C.P. is the latest group to file a lawsuit against Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and the U.S. Postal Service, alleging that recent slowdowns in mail delivery could have grave consequences for Americans’ right to vote. As with the recent lawsuit filed by a coalition of state attorneys general, the N.A.A.C.P. suit asks the court to reverse measures put in place by Mr. DeJoy that have caused delays in the delivery of medications, paychecks, benefits, and ballots. While Mr. DeJoy said on Tuesday he would suspend cost-cutting moves until after the election, the N.A.A.C.P. contends that his announcement only seems to suspend some of the service cuts he has put into place. The recent changes are expected to be discussed at a hearing this afternoon before the Congressional Progressive Caucus where David Williams, a former postal governor who resigned in April, will testify. Lawmakers plan to question Mr. DeJoy at a Senate committee hearing on Friday and at a House oversight hearing on Monday. House lawmakers are also expected to vote Saturday on legislation that would reverse the changes put into place by Mr. DeJoy and provide $25 billion for the beleaguered agency. The N.A.A.C.P.’s complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., states that mail-in ballots will be necessary in November to ensure that people can vote without risking the spread of the coronavirus and notes that infection and death rates for the virus are disproportionately high among Black Americans. It claims that the Postal Service failed to take the required steps before implementing operational changes, including submitting them to the Postal Regulatory Commission, an oversight body. “As the country faces an uphill battle against Covid-19 and systemic racism, we’re witnessing a significant onslaught against our postal system at a time when prompt mail delivery matters more than ever, especially for voters of color,” Derrick Johnson, president of the N.A.A.C.P., said in a statement. — Hailey Fuchs Michael R. Bloomberg promised to spend big to defeat President Trump. Across a few short months, he put a billion dollars into his own bid for the Democratic nomination. Now, having dropped out in March after a skewering on the debate stage by Senator Elizabeth Warren and a lone electoral success in American Samoa, Mr. Bloomberg is preparing to step back into the political spotlight on Thursday with an address to the Democratic National Convention. The appearance, coming just before Joseph R. Biden Jr. will accept the party’s nomination, has stirred anger among some progressives as well as former Bloomberg campaign workers. It has also reignited questions about the multibillionaire’s pledge to throw his fortune behind the general-election effort to defeat Mr. Trump. “He stiffed our party and all the monthly workers he promised to keep on through November,” Amy Siskind, a prominent progressive activist, wrote on Twitter. “Why is Bloomberg speaking?” In March, Mr. Bloomberg made an enormous $18 million transfer to the Democratic Party and offered up the leases to 13 field offices for the party’s use. Within weeks of exiting the 2020 race, he put $4.5 million into three major progressive groups — Swing Left, Collective Future and Voto Latino. But he has not given directly to Mr. Biden, whom he endorsed upon withdrawing from the race, and his termination of thousands of campaign workers who expected to be working through November in Mr. Biden’s name has inspired multiple lawsuits. — Rebecca R. Ruiz Speaker Nancy Pelosi endorsed Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts in the heated Democratic primary for one of the state’s U.S. Senate seats, bolstering the 39-year-old Mr. Kennedy in his challenge to the incumbent, Senator Edward J. Markey. “Never before have the times demanded we elect courageous leaders as today, and that is why I am proud to endorse Joe Kennedy for Senate,” the speaker said in a video announcing her endorsement, which was reported by The Boston Globe. She praised Mr. Kennedy, a grandnephew of President John F. Kennedy and Senator Ted Kennedy, for helping flip the House of Representatives in 2018, adding that he “knows that to achieve progressive change, you must be on the front lines, leading movements of people.” Ms. Pelosi’s decision to endorse in the Sept. 1 primary is unusual: She is usually a significant defender of incumbents in the House, where she served with Mr. Markey for more than a quarter century. Some groups that have tried to challenge Democratic incumbents in the House, only to run into pushback from House leadership, questioned Ms. Pelosi’s decision to back a challenger. “This move reeks of hypocrisy,” said Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats, a grass-roots organization that has helped insurgents like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York defeat incumbents. “The party is setting one standard for progressives and one entirely different standard for the establishment.” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who ousted Joseph Crowley, a member of Democratic leadership, in 2018, declared on Twitter, “no one gets to complain about primary challenges again.” — Emily Cochrane The fourth and final night of the Democratic National Convention will air tonight from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern time.

In the one cubby in the classroom, three colorful blocks spelled out “BLM,” for “Black Lives Matter.” On a shelf over her shoulder were four green letters: “DBFH,” an acronym of her campaign slogan, “Dream big, fight hard.” A child-sized letter carrier’s uniform alluded to the current battle over cutbacks at the Postal Service. A Twitter thread compiled by her campaign revealed the not-so-hidden messages surrounding her: BLM blocks for Black Lives Matter. pic.twitter.com/7ZfYoCraEB — Evan Nicole Brown Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said on Thursday that he was overcome with emotion watching his colleague Kamala Harris accept the Democratic nomination for vice president the night before, but he also issued a warning for his party not to become complacent. Mr. Booker reflected on Ms. Harris’s status as the first Black woman and the first candidate of Indian descent to be on a major party’s presidential ticket during a virtual breakfast hosted by the Pennsylvania Democrats on Zoom. “I had to hold a tissue box as it happened,” Mr. Booker said. He and Ms. Harris, whom he called his sister, had both vied for the Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Booker said that Pennsylvania, a state carried by Mr. Trump in 2016, could decide the election. He vowed to cross the Delaware River to help Democrats in New Jersey’s neighboring state, which he said had enticing vegan cheesesteaks. “I’m willing to get into a boat, dinghy or canoe and come across that river,” he said. — Neil Vigdor Two years after his death, Senator John McCain continues to take flak from President Trump. In a tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump panned Mr. McCain’s unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign and contended that Mr. McCain’s loss to Barack Obama paved the way for Mr. Trump’s election as president in 2016. Sarah is correct. McCain was a lousy candidate with lots of bad policy, but the “deadheads” sabotaged his campaign from the inside, and never gave him a chance to win. Hope they were happy with OBiden, who gave you me! https://t.co/rynLuGRKHA Mr. Trump has lobbed similar posthumous broadsides at Representative John Lewis to Representative John D. Dingell Jr. Mr. Trump was responding to a Fox News appearance on Wednesday night by former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, Mr. McCain’s running mate in 2008. Ms. Palin had been asked to comment about the Republican strategist Steve Schmidt’s endorsement of Mr. Biden in this year’s election. Mr. Schmidt was a top adviser to Mr. McCain in 2008 and clashed with Ms. Palin, a dynamic that was chronicled in the book “Game Change.” Ms. Palin accused Mr. Schmidt and Nicolle Wallace, who also played a prominent role in Mr. McCain’s 2008 campaign, of sabotage and called them “wolves in sheeps’ clothing.” Ms. Wallace is a host on MSNBC. Mr. Trump’s put-down of Mr. McCain was his latest insult directed at Mr. McCain, who  died of a brain tumor in 2018. In 2015, Mr. Trump was condemned across the political spectrum for belittling Mr. McCain’s military record as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. “He’s not a war hero,” Mr. Trump said at the time. “He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.” Months after Mr. McCain’s death, Mr. Trump lashed out at him on Twitter for having voted in 2017 against a bill to repeal Obamacare. And last year, the White House asked the Navy to hide a destroyer named after Mr. McCain so that the ship would not appear in photographs taken while Mr. Trump was visiting Japan. — Neil Vigdor Fox News hosts on Wednesday night devoted four hours to Day 3 of the Democratic convention but carried little of the convention itself. Instead, the programming included more criticism of the Democratic Party; its nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr.; his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris; former President Barack Obama; and the 2016 Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. An example: The host Tucker Carlson asked Sarah Palin if there was anything she could have done in 2008, when she was the Republican vice-presidential nominee, to warrant what she and Mr. Carlson described as the fawning media coverage that Ms. Harris is enjoying. “I would not have prostituted myself in terms of changing any of my positions in order to garner better press,” Ms. Palin said. “For instance,” she elaborated, “I am all about all of our freedoms, including the Second Amendment, and I would not, for instance, say yeah, you know, mandatory gun confiscation, which is what the Democrats are rooting for and pulling for. I would never have gone there in order to get that good coverage.” Ms. Palin was apparently referring to the false claim that Ms. Harris has threatened to send the police to people’s houses to take their guns. Ms. Palin’s words marked a change in tone from last week, when she congratulated Ms. Harris on Instagram and offered tips like, “Don’t get muzzled — connect with media and voters in your own unique way.” Mr. Carlson summed up the convention as “platitudes heaped upon clichés smothered in a thick sauce of self-righteousness and stupidity,” adding, “We only tune in because it’s our job.” The host Sean Hannity cut away to the actual convention only to show about 20 seconds of remarks by Mrs. Clinton, calling her the “twice-failed candidate.” The host Laura Ingraham wrapped up the night by criticizing Mr. Obama’s policies on trade, immigration and international affairs. “He’s the man who solved none of these terrible issues and problems that they’re all talking about during his eight years in office,” she said. “The Obama pixie dust he was sprinkling tonight was more like sand in your eyes.” — Kathleen Gray and Andy Newman Updated Aug. 20, 2020 </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
