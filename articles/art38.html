Trump says he will wait until Friday or Saturday to announce his Supreme Court pick. Here’s what early polls say about who should choose Ginsburg’s replacement. Biden has $466 million in the bank and a huge financial edge on Trump. Justice Department recommends withholding federal funds from three Democratic-led cities, despite lack of clear authority. Biden will be in Wisconsin today as Trump heads to Ohio. As the Supreme Court fight heats up, Biden urges Republican senators to ‘follow your conscience.’ Abortion was on the back-burner in the presidential race. Not anymore. President Trump said on Monday that he would wait until the end of the week to nominate a replacement for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in deference to her funeral services, trimming even further the time available to confirm his selection before the Nov. 3 election as he hopes to do. “I think it’ll be on Friday or Saturday and we want to pay respect, it looks like we will have probably services on Thursday or Friday, as I understand it, and I think in all due respect we should wait until the services are over for Justice Ginsburg,” Mr. Trump said on “Fox & Friends.” Even as he talked about showing respect for Justice Ginsburg, Mr. Trump asserted with absolutely zero evidence that her dying wish that she not be replaced until the next president is chosen, as conveyed by her granddaughter to NPR, was actually made up by Democrats. “I don’t know that she said that, or was that written out by Adam Schiff and Schumer and Pelosi?” he said, referring to three leading Democrats, Representative Adam Schiff of California, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. “I would be more inclined to the second, O.K., you know? That came out of the wind. It sounds so beautiful, but that sounds like a Schumer deal, or maybe a Pelosi or Shifty Schiff.” White House officials had indicated that the announcement of Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court pick could come as early as Tuesday and remain eager to get it done sooner rather than later. The president’s aides have been working on a plan for such a scenario for months, whittling down the list of candidates in advance in order to move quickly. Mr. Trump said he was currently considering five people but did not name them. The front-runner is said to be Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago, followed by Judge Barbara Lagoa of the 11th Circuit in Atlanta, according to people close to the process. Kate Todd, a deputy White House counsel, was also said to be on the list. Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, has also been promoting Judge Allison Jones Rushing of the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, but at age 38, she is viewed by many aides as too young. If Mr. Trump announces his choice on Friday, that would leave just 39 days until the election, which would be the quickest confirmation since Sandra Day O’Connor was appointed in 1981. Since 1975, confirmation on average has taken about 70 days. But Mr. Trump again insisted on a confirmation “before the election” even though Senate Republicans blocked consideration of President Barack Obama’s nomination for a vacant seat in 2016 months before the election. “The bottom line is we won the election, we have an obligation to do what’s right and act as quickly as possible,” Mr. Trump said. The president’s stated goal has set lawmakers on a collision course with one another at a time when Congress already has major issues on its agenda, including spending bills to keep the government open past next week and a stalled coronavirus relief package to help millions of Americans left unemployed by the pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 people. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, on Sunday denounced Mr. Trump’s decision to move ahead with a pick. — Peter Baker Senators were set to return to Washington on Monday with a Supreme Court confirmation fight looming, as Republican leaders weighed the timing of a vote to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. With President Trump vowing to name a replacement by the weekend, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, was working behind the scenes to lock up the support he would need to proceed before Inauguration Day — and possibly before the Nov. 3 election. Two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, have publicly objected to the idea of a vote before Election Day, meaning Mr. McConnell could only afford to lose one more member of his party, given his slim, 53-to-47 majority. Attention was focused on Senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who were seen as possible holdouts but had said nothing publicly about their intentions. Mr. Romney was the only Republican to break with his party and vote to convict and remove Mr. Trump at his impeachment trial. A vote on a Supreme Court nominee before the election could prove tricky for Mr. Gardner, who is in a tough re-election race in the politically competitive state of Colorado. And Mr. Grassley, a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, had previously held to Republicans’ 2016 position that a Supreme Court vacancy should not be filled in an election year. Democrats, who lack the power to block a Supreme Court confirmation on their own, are instead mounting a pressure campaign to sway the two additional Republicans who would be needed to do so. The are also warning of the consequences if they fail. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said that “nothing is off the table” if Democrats were to take control of the Senate, including abolishing the 60-vote legislative filibuster and potentially adding additional seats to the nation’s highest court. The political battle comes as lawmakers are already at a stalemate over another economic stimulus measure to counter the toll of the pandemic, and are working to reach consensus on a stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown at the end of the month. On Capitol Hill on Monday morning, dozens of protesters gathered outside the residence of Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, after he reneged on his vow that any Supreme Court vacancy arising in an election year should not be filled until after Inauguration Day. — Emily Cochrane THE UPSHOT It will be a while until we have a good understanding of public opinion in the aftermath of the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Most high-quality polls are conducted over three or more days, so we’ll have to wait to see many full poll results. Even then, those results will reflect only the state of play at the outset of what’s sure to be a long fight. But here’s what we know so far. The early results are decent for Biden. We do have our first results from a few quick online surveys. YouGov found that voters didn’t want President Trump to appoint a new Supreme Court justice before the 2021 presidential inauguration, by a margin of 51 percent to 42 percent, and that if Mr. Trump did appoint a new justice, they did not want the Senate to seat him or her. Ipsos found that a much larger majority of Americans — 62 percent — think that the winner of the presidential election should replace Justice Ginsburg, while just 23 percent disagreed. Why the big difference? Question wording. The results of issue questions are often highly sensitive to the wording of the question. In this case, the huge difference between the Ipsos and YouGov results might be explained by a common bias in questionnaire design: acquiescence bias. In general, people tend to be nice and agreeable, so questions that simply ask voters to agree or disagree with a statement will generally find higher support for “agreement” than a similar question with a forced choice between opposing ideas. In this case, if the pollster simply asks whether the respondent agrees that the winner of the election should replace Justice Ginsburg, most voters might say “yes.” But if you give the same respondents a second option — whether Mr. Trump should choose the nominee — you can bet that plenty of Trump supporters would take the option, even though they might have agreed, if asked the other question, that the winner should decide. That’s probably a better reflection of the politics of the issue. More of the same in the horse race. There weren’t too many polls this weekend, but most of them were very consistent with what we thought we already knew: a modest but still significant advantage for Joe Biden. Maybe the most noteworthy one was an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, the first live-interview, education-weighted national survey in a while. It found Mr. Biden up by eight points among registered voters, with a net one-point shift in the president’s direction since August. On balance, that’s better for Mr. Biden than both the trend line and the average.  — Nate Cohn Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign said on Sunday that it entered September with $466 million in the bank together with the Democratic Party, giving Mr. Biden a vast financial advantage of about $141 million over President Trump as they head into the intense final stretch of the campaign. That gap marks a complete reversal from this spring, when Mr. Biden emerged as the Democratic nominee and was $187 million behind Mr. Trump, who began raising money for his re-election bid shortly after he was inaugurated in 2017. Mr. Trump dodged a question about the disadvantage during an appearance on Fox & Friends early Monday but noted that the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which prompted millions in contributions to Democratic campaigns over the weekend, was “a big event” for the opposition. “I could raise so much money if I took one day to make phone calls to rich people, but I don’t like doing that. I never have,” Mr. Trump told the show’s hosts, who repeatedly questioned whether he was taking the gap seriously enough. The president’s once-formidable financial lead has been erased after slower spending by Mr. Biden’s campaign in the spring, his record-setting fund-raising over the summer — especially after he named Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate — and heavy early spending by Mr. Trump’s campaign. Mr. Trump and his joint operations with the Republican National Committee entered September with $325 million, according to Mr. Trump’s communications director, Tim Murtaugh. Some Republicans have questioned how a Trump campaign that has raised $1.3 billion since the beginning of 2019 with the Republican National Committee has already spent nearly $1 billion of those funds before the start of voting. Trump officials have repeatedly pointed to their bigger investment in ground operations that Democrats have forgone during the pandemic, such as door-to-door canvassing, as prudent spending that will provide a benefit as voting begins. “Our early investment in states is going to move the needle in a way that Joe Biden’s campaign just can’t do, even if they tried starting now,” Bill Stepien, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, told reporters earlier this month. An extraordinary influx of cash in August accounts for Mr. Biden’s newfound financial lead, after he and his opponent entered the month nearly neck and neck. The Biden campaign and his joint operations with the Democratic National Committee raised a record $364.5 million last month — more than any previous candidate has raised in a single month — while Mr. Trump brought in $210 million, their campaigns said. “We’re going to have the resources, not just to go wide on our map but also to go deep within those states,” said Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, regarding the Electoral College battlegrounds. — Shane Goldmacher and Glenn Thrush Attorney General William P. Barr escalated the Trump administration’s war on Democratic-led cities on Monday by identifying three that he said could lose federal funding over their responses to protests against police brutality and systemic racism this summer. It is unclear whether the administration has the legal standing to withdraw the funding. An effort by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to defund so-called sanctuary cities is still winding its way through the courts with mixed results. Still, the Justice Department said that New York, Seattle and Portland had all “permitted violence and destruction of property to persist and have refused to undertake reasonable measures to counteract criminal activities.” “We cannot allow federal tax dollars to be wasted when the safety of the citizenry hangs in the balance,” Mr. Barr said in a statement. “It is my hope that the cities identified by the Department of Justice today will reverse course and become serious about performing the basic function of government and start protecting their own citizens.” President Trump has cast Democrats as unable to protect citizens and maintain public safety, often resorting to great exaggeration or misleading characterizations of Democratic positions. In a memo earlier this month, he threatened to withdraw billions of dollars from some of the country’s largest cities. The memo gave Mr. Barr 14 days to identify anarchist jurisdictions, citing the cities of New York, Seattle and Portland as some that had permitted “anarchy.” All three cities are led by Democratic mayors. — Katie Benner Former Vice President Joseph R.

Biden Jr. urged Republicans on Sunday not to rush a Supreme Court nominee through the Senate in the final six weeks before the presidential election, suggesting that such a move would amount to an “abuse of power” at an already perilous moment in American political history. In his first extensive remarks on the looming Supreme Court battle since he acknowledged the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday, Mr. Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, appealed directly to the few pivotal Senate Republicans “who really will decide what happens,” urging them to oppose an effort to push through a new nominee before the election. “Please, follow your conscience,” he pleaded in a speech at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. “Don’t vote to confirm anyone nominated under the circumstances President Trump and Senator McConnell have created. Don’t go there. Uphold your constitutional duty. Your conscience. Let the people speak. Cool the flames that have been engulfing our country.” TRANSCRIPT The voters of this country should be heard. As I said, voting’s already begun. By the time we get to the middle of October, there will be millions and millions and millions who have already voted. In just a few weeks, all votes in this nation will be heard. They’re the ones who the Constitution envisioned should decide who has the power to make this appointment. And even if President Trump wants to put forward a name now, the Senate should not act until after the American people select their next president, their next Congress, their next Senate. If Donald Trump wins the election, then the Senate should move on his selection and weigh the nominee he chooses fairly. But if I win this election, President Trump’s nominee should be withdrawn. And as the new president, I should be the one to nominate Justice Ginsburg’s successor. We’re in the middle of a pandemic. Like I said, as I speak, we’re probably passing 200,000 deaths lost to this virus. Tens of millions of Americans are unemployed, health care in this country hangs in the balance before the court. And now, in a raw political move this president and the Republican leader have decided to jam a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court through the United States Senate. That’s the last thing we need at this moment. So I appeal to those few Senate Republicans, the handful who really will decide what happens, please follow your conscience. Don’t vote to confirm anyone nominated under the circumstances President Trump and Senator McConnell have created. Don’t go there. Mr. Trump has promised to nominate a replacement for the position in the next week, seizing on an issue that has the potential to electrify the bases of both political parties and to inject a new measure of uncertainty into an already unpredictable presidential race. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has vowed to hold a floor vote. Many Republican senators have already indicated their support for Mr. Trump’s approach, fueling long-simmering Democratic skepticism over Mr. Biden’s insistence that bipartisan cooperation was still possible, even in an era of political polarization. Mr. Biden promised on Sunday that as president, he would consult with senators from both parties before selecting his own nominee, part of “a process that restores our finest traditions, not the extension of one that’s torn this country apart the last years.”  — Katie Glueck and Thomas Kaplan For months, abortion has been relegated to a back burner in the presidential campaign, eclipsed by a worldwide pandemic, an economic crisis and protests over racial justice. But the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the looming confirmation battle to replace her could force the candidates to discuss a volatile issue six weeks before Election Day — one that carries significant political risks for both sides, even as it energizes portions of their bases. Mainstream views on abortion are more moderate than those of the activists on either wing, with most Americans saying that abortions should be legal with some restrictions. An all-out fight over abortion could further alienate the more moderate suburban voters that both sides are competing for. Democrats especially must navigate their own divisions over how far to push an issue that Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, has long found personally uncomfortable. Since Justice Ginsburg’s death on Friday, President Trump and Mr. Biden have so far treaded lightly on the subject. But there is pressure on both candidates to address the abortion issue, because of its significance to their respective bases at a moment when so much is at stake. Socially conservative strategists see the sudden emergence of the abortion issue as an important opportunity for Mr. Trump, who has lagged in the polls. They believe it may help shore up Republican swing voters in Arizona, or motivate base voters who might not have gotten around to requesting an absentee ballot. “This alters the political landscape in a very significant way,” said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. “This will take the focus off the coronavirus; this will take the focus off a lot of things.” Planned Parenthood, the largest reproductive rights organization in the country, is reassessing its strategy to fight a two-front war: pushing for Mr. Biden and Democratic candidates in key states, and pressing Republican senators to hold off on a confirmation vote until a new president is elected. The group is planning to run a new round of political ads. “People are fired up — they’re in front of the court, they’re rallying, they’re holding vigils,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of Planned Parenthood. “All of the tools are coming out to play in this fight, not only to prevent this nomination from happening but also around the election.” — Lisa Lerer and Elizabeth Dias President Trump’s expected announcement of a Supreme Court nominee will reshape the presidential campaign and draw intense attention to a handful of Republican senators.
