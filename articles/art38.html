A poll in North Carolina finds voters distrustful of Trump and Tillis. NBC faces blowback for booking a Trump town hall Thursday to compete with Biden’s on ABC. Biden did not meet with a Ukrainian energy executive, his campaign says. Lindsey Graham, running for re-election, says his reference to ‘the good old days of segregation’ was sarcastic. Obama plans to hit the road for Biden. But first, a podcast. What Kamala Harris learned about power at Howard University. An estimated 5.2 million Americans cannot vote in the 2020 election because they have been convicted of felonies, according to a report released Wednesday by the Sentencing Project — a number that most likely depresses turnout for Democrats. Only about a quarter of those people are actually incarcerated, the report says, and more than 4 in 10 have completed their full sentence but remain barred from the polls. The United States is an outlier in permitting the denial of voting rights to people who are former felons, and the specific provisions governing the restoration of those rights vary widely from state to state. Felony disenfranchisement occurs at higher rates in the South, and is generally believed to hurt Democrats on balance, in part because a disproportionate number of those barred from voting are Black, and Black voters make up a significant part of the Democratic base. The new report found that Black Americans are disenfranchised by felony records at almost four times the rate of others. In seven states — Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wyoming — more than one in seven Black adults are disenfranchised, it found. That is more than twice the national average of Black felony disenfranchisement. Thanks to state actions expanding the restoration of voting rights, the total number of people barred from voting is down by 15 percent from the 2016 presidential election, when the Sentencing Project, which tracks incarceration data and advocates for a “fair and effective” criminal justice system, estimated that 6.2 million people were blocked. In the past four years, several states have removed some barriers to voting, including Colorado, Louisiana, Nevada, New Jersey and Wyoming. Governors in Iowa, Kentucky, Virginia and New York have restored voting rights to large categories of people through blanket executive orders. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, for example, has granted 61,075 people on parole the right to vote, according to the state corrections department. Georgia edged out Florida as the state with the highest rate of felony disenfranchisement, according to the report, but Florida still leads the country in the sheer number of those disenfranchised, an estimated 1.1 million people. In 2018, Florida voters overwhelmingly approved a measure to restore voting rights after completion of sentence, but the state legislature has since blocked anyone who has failed to pay court-ordered fines and fees from regaining the right to vote. — Shaila Dewan President Trump on Wednesday expressed support to California Republicans who installed more than 50 unauthorized absentee-ballot drop boxes falsely labeled “official” — an extraordinary endorsement by a president of a practice that state officials say is deceptive and illegal. “Fight hard Republicans,” Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet that linked to an article about California state officials demanding the removal of the unauthorized boxes. California’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, has given the state Republican Party until Thursday to remove the boxes, which are labeled “Official Ballot Drop Off Box” or “Ballot Drop Box” and have been placed near churches, gun shops and party offices in Los Angeles, Orange and Fresno Counties over the last two weeks. The party has refused to remove the boxes or even place disclaimers on them. To the average voter, the gray metal boxes are virtually indistinguishable from drop-off sites established by the state, which are governed by strict regulations intended to prevent the partisan manipulation or theft of ballots. This is not the first time Mr. Trump has advised his supporters to contravene the law or state regulations to undermine the integrity of the election or erode faith in the process. In September, he suggested that North Carolinians stress-test the security of their elections systems by voting twice — an act that constitutes the kind of voter fraud the president has railed against. In recent months, a handful of states and local governments, most of them controlled by Democrats, have expanded the use of drop boxes as a safe alternative to voting in person during the coronavirus pandemic, and Republicans have tried to reverse those efforts through state orders or lawsuits. Mr. Trump has repeatedly slammed Democrats for a practice known as “ballot harvesting” — the collection of assigning a third party to collect batches of voter ballots. But on Monday, Hector Barajas, a spokesman for the California Republican Party, said the party’s actions were legal because state law did not restrict them from collecting voters’ completed ballots. He blamed Democrats for blocking Republicans from making the third-party collection of ballots illegal. Mr. Trump seized on that point on Wednesday, tweeting, Democrats “have been taking advantage of the system for years!” But the placement of the boxes go beyond anything either party has done, and Mr. Becerra said he would consider pressing criminal charges or seeking a civil court ruling against the party. “This is like nothing I have ever seen before,” Mr. Becerra, a Democrat, said in a phone interview on Tuesday, contending that state Republicans were trying to stir up confusion around drop boxes. “You want people to have confidence in the system, to know that if you submit a ballot it will be counted. How can you do this at a time when people are losing faith in the process?” — Glenn Thrush With a half-million votes already cast, President Trump and Senator Thom Tillis trail their Democratic challengers in North Carolina, according to a new poll from The New York Times and Siena College, signaling potential trouble for Republicans in a state critical to both the presidential race and the battle for control of the Senate. Joe Biden leads Donald Trump in North Carolina, a state Mr. Trump won in 2016. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of 627 likely voters in North Carolina from Oct. 9 to Oct.13. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. leads Mr. Trump among likely voters, 46 percent to 42 percent, while Mr. Tillis is behind Cal Cunningham, his Democratic challenger, 41 percent to 37 percent. Both leads are within the poll’s margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, leads his Republican challenger, Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, more comfortably, 51 percent to 37 percent. The poll was conducted within the last few days, well after Mr. Cunningham offered an awkward public apology for the romantic (but PG-rated) texts he sent this summer to a woman who is not his wife. It found that Mr. Cunningham, a former state senator and an Iraq war veteran, retains a 15-point advantage among women. Democrats are hoping that Mr. Cunningham will be one of at least four challengers the party needs to win Republican-held seats to take control of the Senate. While Mr. Cunningham has seen the percentage of likely voters who viewers him unfavorably jump in the last month from 29 percent to 41 percent, the new poll found that he and Mr. Tillis are viewed as untrustworthy by the same portion of  voters: 48 percent. Mr. Cunningham’s five-point lead over Mr. Tillis in the Times/Siena poll has held steady since early September, but there is still time and room for the race to shift: 15 percent of voters surveyed said they remained undecided in the Senate race — nearly twice as many as those who said they were undecided in the presidential contest in North Carolina. Mr. Biden’s standing in North Carolina, a state that Mr. Trump won by almost four points in 2016,  is consistent with the leads he has built in other battleground states. The former vice president has significant advantages among women and suburbanites, and is far more trusted to deal with the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus. Early in-person voting begins in North Carolina on Thursday. — Reid J. Epstein and Matt Stevens NBC was battered with criticism on Wednesday after it announced plans for a Thursday town hall with President Trump to air opposite an already-scheduled ABC event with his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr. Top Democrats, media pundits, and many journalists inside NBC and MSNBC were taken aback by the network’s choice of the 8 p.m. Eastern time slot, which will make it impossible for Americans to watch both candidates live. “The point of a news organization is to serve the public,” Vivian Schiller, a former executive at NBC, Twitter, and National Public Radio, wrote on Twitter. “This is the opposite.” Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden were originally been scheduled to face off on Thursday in Miami at a formal debate — until last week, when Mr. Trump abruptly withdrew after the Commission on Presidential Debates decided to stage the event virtually over concerns that Mr. Trump could still be contagious with the coronavirus. Mr. Biden quickly arranged his own telecast with ABC, prompting Mr. Trump’s campaign to seek its own event that evening. After a lengthy negotiation — NBC wanted proof that the president would not pose a health risk, which it only received on Tuesday — the network announced its plans Wednesday morning. Numerous staff members at NBC and MSNBC expressed private dismay on Wednesday at their leaders’ decision. One former NBC News executive, Mark Lukasiewicz, who produced political conventions and candidate forums for the network, wrote on Twitter, “This is a bad result for American voters, who should not be forced to choose which to watch.” Presidential events have a unique draw, particularly at the height of the campaign: Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump’s first debate in Cleveland last month drew 73 million viewers. Neither town hall on Thursday is likely to come anywhere close to those numbers, given that formal debates air simultaneously across a dozen or more networks. Whether exposure to a mass audience is politically useful for Mr. Trump is also an open question: he received poor marks for his performance at last month’s debate. — Michael M. Grynbaum The Biden campaign on Wednesday rejected a New York Post report that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had met with an adviser to the Ukrainian energy company associated with his son Hunter Biden, a claim based on material provided by Republican allies of President Trump who have tried for months to tarnish Mr. Biden over his son. In a statement, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, Andrew Bates, said that Mr. Biden’s official schedules showed no meeting between Mr. Biden and an adviser to the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, on which Hunter Biden served. The Post story has cited an email allegedly sent from that adviser, Vadym Pozharskyi, to Hunter Biden, thanking him for “giving an opportunity to meet your father.” The authenticity of the email correspondence could not be independently verified. “We have reviewed Joe Biden’s official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place,” Mr. Bates said. Facebook said Wednesday it had decided to limit the distribution of the story on its platform, saying it invited additional fact-checking. A Twitter spokesman also said it would block links to the story and images of it from being posted on its platform. Hunter Biden’s business dealings have been a subject of intense Republican focus over the last year, including his ties to a Ukrainian company while Mr. Biden, as vice president, worked on Ukraine policy. Both Bidens have said that the two did not discuss Ukraine with each other . A presidential impeachment tied to the subject and an investigation by Senate Republicans have found no evidence that Mr. Biden, the former vice president, engaged in wrongdoing over his son’s business dealings. The Post report said the email correspondence was part of a trove of material on a laptop computer that was dropped off for repairs at a shop in Delaware, Mr. Biden’s home state, and never retrieved. It said the store owner made a copy of the correspondence and provided it to the lawyer for Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, who provided the material to The Post. “The New York Post never asked the Biden campaign about the critical elements of this story,” Mr. Bates said. “They certainly never raised that Rudy Giuliani — whose discredited conspiracy theories and alliance with figures connected to Russian intelligence have been widely reported — claimed to have such materials.” Mr. Trump was impeached in December for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, charges centered around his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and other Democrats. He was acquitted by the Senate in early February. Senate Republicans have been conducting an investigation into Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings and whether the elder Mr. Biden had improperly used his influence to help his son. They issued a report last month that concluded that while Hunter Biden had “cashed in’’ on his father’s name to close lucrative deals, there was no evidence of improper influence or wrongdoing by the former vice president. — Katie Glueck Senator Lindsey Graham, who is fighting off an increasingly steep re-election challenge in South Carolina, drew criticism on Wednesday after he invoked the “good old days of segregation” at the confirmation hearing of Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Asking the judge about various Supreme Court precedents as he opened the third day of hearings, Mr. Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, appeared to be trying to drive home the point that there was no longer any meaningful push in America to challenge the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, which held that school segregation was unconstitutional. “One of the reasons you can say with confidence that you think Brown v. Board of Education is a super precedent is you are not aware of any effort to go back to the good old days of segregation via legislative body. Is that correct?” he asked. Judge Barrett answered in the affirmative. Mr. Graham later said that he was being sarcastic when he used the expression, but for the second time in a week he found himself on the defensive for remarks about race. Mr. Graham, who has evolved into one of President Trump’s biggest allies from one of his toughest critics, and who reversed himself on the propriety of trying to confirm a Supreme Court justice in an election year now that doing so benefits Republicans, has been tied in recent polls of the state. His comment drew a swift rebuke from his Democratic rival, Jaime Harrison, who shared a clip of Mr. Graham’s remark on his Twitter account, sending it bouncing across social media. “The good old days for who, Senator?” asked Mr. Harrison, who is Black. “It’s 2020, not 1920. Act like it.” .@LindseyGrahamSC just called segregation “the good old days.” The good old days for who, Senator?

It’s 2020, not 1920. Act like it. pic.twitter.com/qVhhfp7oRY During a break in the hearing, Mr. Graham said he had been misunderstood and rebuked his opponent for the criticism. His comments were “dripping with sarcasm,” Mr. Graham said, referring to the era of segregation as “dark days.” “It blows my mind that any rational person could believe that about me,” he added. The comment came just a few days after Mr. Graham was roundly criticized for saying during a campaign forum in South Carolina that Black people “can go anywhere in this state” as long as they were “conservative, not liberal.” He had been talking about his friendship with the state’s other Republican senator, Tim Scott, who is a Black man. — Nicholas Fandos Former President Barack Obama plans to hit the road on behalf of his former vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., over the next two weeks for socially-distanced appearances in battleground states to encourage Democrats during early voting, according to people familiar with his plans. Aides to the former president would not say where or when Mr. Obama plans to travel but a person familiar with the planning said his team had discussed possible visits to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin or Florida with Mr. Biden’s team. It is not clear if Michelle Obama, the former first lady and a figure whose popularity rivals her husband’s, will also make in-person appearances. Aides to Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden would not respond to specific questions about his schedule and said an announcement would be forthcoming when the arrangements had been finalized. Mr. Obama’s endgame re-engagement, a reprise of his efforts on behalf of Hillary Clinton four years ago, kicks off this afternoon when he sits down with two former White House advisers, Jon Favreau and Tommy Vietor, who host the popular Pod Save America podcast. The podcast episode, due to run 30 minutes, will be taped at 4 p.m. and posted Wednesday evening; interview topics will include “his thoughts on the race, his pitch to voters, his thoughts on the future of Trumpism and democracy,” Mr. Favreau said. Mr. Obama, who adopted a posture of neutrality during the Democratic primaries, expressed initial reluctance to take on President Trump personally — to deprive him of an easy foil that could motivate the president’s base. But he cast aside caution over the summer and fall, appearing at fund-raisers, roundtables and side-by-sides with Mr. Biden and campaign surrogates over Zoom. Mr. Obama’s address to the Democratic convention in August painted a dire picture of the country under Mr. Trump, portraying him as a man unfit, uncaring and unserious, who threatens both the nation’s welfare and its core democratic institutions. “This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that’s what it takes to win,” Mr. Obama, hair grayed and manner grave, said in one of the most comprehensive denunciations of a sitting president made by a predecessor. — Glenn Thrush TRANSCRIPT “We’ll make sure that all of these emails get to the right place, and we will do everything we can to make sure that the American people get a chance to see as much as we can equitably produce.” Reporter: “If you look at the chronology of public statements surrounding this development, it would appear that this action was taken by you in response to public, pleas from the president. You’ve been secretary of state for two and a half years or so. You’ve had ample time to meet the imperatives of transparency and doing so within three weeks of an election, obviously will strike even fair-minded observers as political in nature.” “I actually have been involved in these emails for a long time. You’ll recall I previously served as a member of Congress, where Secretary Clinton’s use of personal server containing classified information became a very important issue. I think that’s really important for the American people to continue to understand — this isn’t that there was a stray comment on her personal server. This was a system designed to evade State Department rules and regulations on which, on that server, ended up containing highly classified information — that’s important. Second, with respect to our transparency, it’s an ongoing process. We’ve had people out for Covid. We have lots of challenges and production of documents — today, you can go to the State Department’s website and see 35,000-plus emails that came from Secretary Clinton’s server that were provided in response to various inquiries. We’ve provided documents to Capitol Hill all throughout my time in two and half years. And we’re going to continue to do the work as we identify material. We look at it and review it. We’ll make sure we make the right decisions for the American people and transparency.” Under intense pressure from President Trump, who is behind in the polls and seeking a rerun of the help his campaign got from late discussion of Hillary Clinton’s emails in 2016, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that Americans had a right to “transparency” — but did not commit to releasing any more of the emails ahead of the Nov. 3 election. Mr. Pompeo’s comments to journalists on Wednesday appeared to be an attempt to placate his boss and fuel political outrage against Mrs. Clinton, even as he said that the State Department had already released more than 35,000 documents from her personal server. “We’re going to continue to do the work,” Mr. Pompeo said. “As we identify material, we’ll look at it and review; we’ll make sure we make the right decisions for the American people, in transparency.” He refused to say how many more emails have yet to be released from a cache that Mrs. Clinton, who served as secretary of state under President Barack Obama, turned over to investigators as she campaigned for president against Mr. Trump in 2016. Instead, Mr. Pompeo noted that “35,000-plus emails that came from Secretary Clinton’s server that were provided in response to various inquiries” were posted on the State Department’s website. Mr. Pompeo also said that the department has continued to release documents since he took over in 2018; the last batch appears to have been posted on the department’s website in May 2019. Last year, State Department investigators concluded that while she was secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton had risked compromising classified information by using a private email server for official business. But they found that she did not deliberately or systematically do so. Mrs. Clinton had largely disappeared from public life since 2016. But Mr. Trump, who is trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr. in polls and is seeking to whip up supporters in the homestretch of the campaign, has been reminding voters of the email debacle and lashing out at Mr. Pompeo for not releasing all the documents. “They’re in the State Department, but Mike Pompeo has been unable to get them out, which is very sad,” the president said last week. “Actually, I’m not happy about him for that — that reason. He was unable to get them out. I don’t know why. You’re running the State Department, you get them out. Forget about the fact that they were classified. Let’s go. Maybe Mike Pompeo finally finds them.” Mr. Pompeo initially said he would “get the information out that needs to get out.” But his remarks on Wednesday left it unclear when any release might happen. He cited delays in producing additional documents because of the coronavirus and other “challenges.” He also dismissed as “ridiculous” a question about whether releasing more of Mrs. Clinton’s emails at Mr. Trump’s demand would violate the Hatch Act, which bars political activity at the federal workplace. — Lara Jakes President Trump’s advisers did not expect Iowa to be a swing state in 2020. Though the state is a traditional presidential battleground, Republicans hoped that Mr. Trump’s 9-point victory there in his first campaign signaled that Iowa was his for keeps. It hasn’t turned out that way: private polling for both parties has found Mr. Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. in a tossup contest for Iowa’s seven electoral votes. The state continues to battle coronavirus outbreaks, with Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, resisting the strictest public-health measures, and perhaps contributing to Mr. Trump’s challenges. And so the president is headed to Des Moines for a rally on Wednesday evening, aiming to pump up his conservative base. In overwhelmingly white, largely rural Iowa, Mr. Biden’s electoral strength is all about support from women. A New York Times/Siena College poll last month found Mr. Biden was leading among Iowa women by 14 points, while Mr. Trump was up by 8 points with men. In that poll, women in the state disapproved of Mr. Trump by a double digit margin, and fully half of female voters said they strongly disapproved of the president. But Mr. Trump continues to have a path to winning the state because of the support he has in the most rural areas. Mr. Biden is leading in the Des Moines metro area and in the smaller cities in Eastern Iowa, but the president fares better in the less-populated swaths of the agriculture-heavy state. For Republicans, the stakes for Mr. Trump’s visit go beyond just the presidential race. Senator Joni Ernst, a first-term Republican, is in a difficult fight for re-election against Theresa Greenfield, her Democratic challenger, and there are contested House races in all four of Iowa’s congressional districts. While Republican hopes of picking up some of Iowa’s three Democratic-held House seats have receded, the party is still aiming to hold the line in down-ballot races there, even if Mr. Trump gets wiped out at the national level. But having the president himself front-and-center in the state may be a mixed blessing for Republicans there. There is no telling exactly what message Mr. Trump might deliver onstage in Des Moines, or whether the presence of the world’s most famous coronavirus patient is likely to help or hinder candidates who are trying to focus voters’ attention on other issues in the final weeks of the campaign. — Alexander Burns As a student at Howard University, called “The Mecca” by those who know its legacy, Kamala Harris settled into the pragmatic politics that have defined her career. She participated in protests, but was a step removed from the more extreme voices on campus. She sparred with the Black Republicans on the debate team but made no secret that she thought some tactics by activists on the left were going too far. She extolled the values of racial representation, joining a generation of Black students who decided to step into the institutions — in government and the corporate world — that were unavailable to their parents. In interviews, more than a dozen classmates and friends who knew Ms. Harris and attended Howard themselves placed their experience in the larger context of Black politics in the 1980s and a changing Washington. They were the children of the civil rights movement, the early beneficiaries of federal school desegregation, with newfound access to institutions and careers. Words like mass incarceration and systemic racism were not yet widely used, though the effects of both were becoming visible around Howard’s campus. Instead, there was an overarching belief among them that increased racial representation could bend any institution to their will, that participating in a system many viewed as unjust was an important form of harm reduction. Ms. Harris has personally cited this belief in years since, including when she discusses her decision to become a prosecutor. More than 30 years later, the power and limitations of Ms. Harris’s instinct to couple insider politics with her lens as a Black woman and first-generation American are on display as Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s running mate. On the vice-presidential debate stage last week, Vice President Mike Pence criticized her record as prosecutor, arguing that it disproportionately affected people of color. “I will not sit here and be lectured by the vice president on what it means to enforce the laws of our country,” Ms. Harris responded, a response that is also a callback to a worldview that she formed in college. That’s when she and her classmates weighed what to do in the world and decided a system that had historically oppressed Black Americans could be made to work in their favor. Ms. Harris, who declined to be interviewed about her college years, said through a campaign spokeswoman that she was proud to be back at Howard — occasionally working from an office on campus during the campaign — and that the college was “a place that shaped her.” — Astead W. Herndon Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign on Wednesday introduced a new ad featuring Bridgett Floyd, one of George Floyd’s sisters, who in an emotional testimonial calls the former vice president “the change we need.” Set against a soft piano score, Ms. Floyd recalls Mr. Biden’s personal outreach after the killing of Mr. Floyd by the Minneapolis police, set against pictures of Mr. Biden praying, reflecting and interacting with Black voters on the campaign trail. “He was actually there to listen,” Ms. Floyd says in the ad. “He was very sincere.” The ad, released on what would have been Mr. Floyd’s 47th birthday, comes as the Biden campaign is ramping up its effort to energize Black voters as early voting gets underway. Though the ad will air nationally on television, digital platforms and radio, the Biden campaign plans to target it in 16 different states as well. The ad is being accompanied by a day of action to honor Mr. Floyd on his birthday, organized by the George Floyd Memorial Foundation, which was founded by members of his family. The social media campaign asks people to ensure that they “make a voting plan now” and to call their senators to pass a criminal justice overhaul bill. The foundation also announced a partnership with the National Urban League to get out the vote. “He should still be here today,” Ms. Floyd said in a statement. “For that reason, I greatly believe that we need change, and it’s pivotal that people vote in this election. People need to make a plan and take voting seriously — it’s more important than ever.” — Nick Corasaniti It is one of the most enduring questions of President Trump’s appeal: Who are the nearly 30 percent of Hispanic voters who say they support him, despite his anti-immigration rhetoric and policies? There is no one simple answer. Mr. Trump has strong backing from Cuban and Venezuelan exiles in South Florida, who like his stance against communism. And his campaign has heavily courted evangelical Latinos throughout the country. But no other group worries Democrats more than American-born Hispanic men, particularly those under the age 45, who polls show are highly skeptical of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Men are the core of President Trump’s base. In polling, gender gaps exist in nearly every demographic: among white voters, among senior citizens, among voters without a college degree, men are far more likely than women to support his re-election. Polls suggest that this election could result in the largest gender gap since the passage of the 19th Amendment a century ago. Yet what has alienated so many older, female and suburban voters is a key part of Mr. Trump’s appeal to many of these men, interviews with dozens of Mexican-American men supporting Mr. Trump shows: To them, the macho allure of Mr. Trump is undeniable. He is forceful, wealthy and, most important, unapologetic. In a world where at any moment someone might be attacked for saying the wrong thing, he says the wrong thing all the time and does not bother with self-flagellation. Paul Ollarsaba Jr., a 41-year-old Marine veteran, voted for a Republican for the first time in 2016, won over by what he saw as Mr. Trump’s commitment to the military. “I am Mexican,” Mr. Ollarsaba said, adding that for years he thought that meant he had to vote for Democrats. When he began supporting Mr. Trump in 2016, his family ostracized him. “My parents say: ‘Why are you supporting a racist? You’re Mexican, you have to vote this way,’” he said. “No, it’s my country. It’s fear, people are afraid of saying they support the president.” Though Hispanic women overwhelmingly support Mr. Biden, Hispanic men appear to have a persistent discomfort, with polls showing him struggling to maintain more than 60 percent of the group, far below his average among nonwhite voters. Mr. Biden has not done enough to directly reach out to these young Latino men, Republican and Democratic strategists say. “You have these U.S.-born Hispanic males under 40 who are pretty Trumpy, the question is why?” said Mike Madrid, a Republican consultant involved with the Lincoln Project, which is working to get Mr. Trump out of the White House. — Jennifer Medina AD WATCH With less than three weeks to go before Nov. 3, it’s the time of year for closing messages. And for candidates with virtually unlimited money, that means highly-produced 60-second TV ads voiced by high-profile surrogates that intend to leave the viewer optimistic and perhaps a bit emotional not just about voting but about America and, maybe, even life itself. These two ads, from the Democratic Senate candidates Jaime Harrison in South Carolina and Mark Kelly in Arizona, don’t bother to mention the incumbent Republicans each man is trying to defeat. They don’t have to, because by this point in the campaign, voters in each state have been bombarded by tens of millions of dollars of advertising eviscerating Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Martha McSally of Arizona. Instead, Mr. Harrison and Mr. Kelly are, in the closing weeks of the campaign, pitching voters on a broader idea. For Mr. Harrison, it’s a belief, voiced by the South Carolina-born actress Viola Davis, that a Democrat can win in what has been a solidly Republican state for a generation. Mr. Kelly’s ad, voiced by his wife, the former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, is her testimonial to his fidelity and loyalty — to her, to the country and, if elected, to Arizona. It almost doesn’t matter what’s in the ad; just hearing Ms. Giffords’s voice, still shaky nine years after she was shot in the head outside a Tucson supermarket, is a moving tribute to his candidacy. Neither ad touches on any policy stance or political statement. Their aim is simply to tug at heartstrings without offering a political rationale. It’s the television version of the phrase: “If you know, you know.” Mr. Harrison’s and Mr. Kelly’s ads are airing in their respective states. These ads are the luxury of a campaign so flush with cash that it can afford a minute-long interruption to the onslaught of vituperative TV spots in battleground states. They bring to mind the classic 2016 Bernie Sanders ad with no words, set to the Simon and Garfunkel song “America,” and represent the campaign’s final efforts to define themselves. For Mr. Harrison, that means inspiring hope that he can actually win. For Mr. Kelly, it’s pitching the idea that the famously prickly former astronaut is actually a nice guy. — Reid J. Epstein The unlikely transformation of Joseph R. Biden Jr., a 77-year-old whose seemingly limited appeal to small donors left him financially outflanked in the primaries, into perhaps the greatest magnet for online money in American political history is a testament to the ferocity of Democratic opposition to President Trump. Mr. Biden now has a once-unimaginable cash edge over Mr. Trump, and since Sept. 1 he has reserved about $140 million more in television advertising than the president. Money alone does not determine presidential winners — Hillary Clinton vastly outspent Mr. Trump in 2016 — but the cash has provided Mr. Biden enviable flexibility to engineer the electoral map to his advantage. “There was always going to be a large amount of money coming into the nominee,” said Michael Whitney, a Democratic digital fund-raising specialist who worked for Senator Bernie Sanders in the primary. “I’m sure they never dreamed it would be this big.” To chart Mr. Biden’s consequential financial turnabout, The New York Times analyzed the flow of nearly 11 million online contributions from the first nearly 500 days of his campaign. The analysis looked at $436 million given through August to Mr. Biden and his shared committee with the Democratic National Committee via ActBlue, the donation-processing platform. Checks, merchandise sales and other offline giving were not included. The Times analysis shows four inflection points in Mr. Biden’s fund-raising metamorphosis, beginning with one unwittingly provided last fall by Mr. Trump, whose presidency has been rocket fuel for Democratic fund-raising. The other three points — all linked in different ways to race — emerge from the 2020 data: Mr. Biden’s sweeping victories delivered by Black voters in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, the protests following the police killing of George Floyd and, especially, the selection of Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
