Florida sees a record early vote, with Democrats casting more mail-in ballots than Republicans. A poll finds Trump and Biden tied in Georgia, and Democrats gaining in Senate races. ‘No more business as usual’: Democrats weigh boycott of committee vote on Judge Barrett. Pennsylvania, where Trump will campaign Tuesday, has been battered by the coronavirus. Voters favor Biden over Trump on almost all major issues, a new poll shows. Melania Trump, who had the coronavirus, cancels a campaign appearance because of a lingering cough. MILWAUKEE — Despite the unseasonably cool 35-degree temperature, lines were already snaking around two sides of the Frank P. Zeidler Municipal Building in downtown Milwaukee by 7:30 a.m., as crowds waited for more than two hours to cast their ballots on the first day of early voting in Wisconsin. Jon Berlin, 70, a psychiatrist, arrived with his partner, Susan Hrlevich, 60, at 5:20 a.m. The pair, who are independent voters, wore parkas and brought folding canvas chairs as they walked from their downtown residence to cast votes for Joseph R. Biden Jr. They said they feared even longer lines — and exposure to the coronavirus — if they had waited until Nov. 3 to vote. “I don’t feel safe in this country for the first time,” said Mr. Berlin. “We have this horrible pandemic and we need a leader who can face the truth and tell the truth.” Early voting has drawn crowds around the nation, and both campaigns are seeking to turn out their supporters. Senator Kamala Harris of California, Mr. Biden’s running mate, planned to participate in a virtual Milwaukee rally with Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and several local officials to encourage early voting there. Chrystal Gillon-Mabry, a 68-year-old artist, and her sister, Coral Hegwood, 59, a retired city employee, brought books to read and chairs when they arrived before 5:30 a.m. Ms. Hegwood said that she was still undecided as she stood in line. “I don’t want to vote for Trump, but I don’t want to compromise my Christian beliefs,” she said. Afterward, she said she had voted for Mr. Biden. “I prayed and prayed on it,” she said, concluding that “Biden has more compassion than Trump — he has no compassion or empathy for anybody.” Before in-person early voting began Tuesday, more than 915,000 Wisconsinites had voted since officials began mailing absentee ballots Sept. 17, a figure that amounts to about 30 percent of the state’s total vote in 2016. The turnout has been far higher in the state’s traditionally Democratic strongholds. Dane County, which includes Madison and is by far the state’s most Democratic county, has had turnout already that amounts to close to half the votes cast there four years ago. No other county’s turnout eclipsed more than 37 percent of its 2016 numbers. While Wisconsin Democrats have encouraged voters to cast ballots as soon as they are able, the state’s Republican Party urged supporters to wait until early voting began. “Avoid the long lines on Election Day,” read a flyer the Republican Party of Wisconsin mailed to supporters last week, urging them to make plans to vote early, which the state describes as voting “absentee” in person. The mailing made no mention of voting by mail. Denise Williams, 67, who uses a walker and has been staying mostly at home since the pandemic, was glad to socialize — from at least a few feet apart — with fellow voters, all of whom wore masks. She arrived at 6 a.m. and waited almost three hours. “Our country is too divided, I want it back together again,” said Ms. Williams, a retired nursing assistant who voted for Mr. Biden. She would have voted by mail, she said, but she never received a ballot. “I wanted to make sure my vote got in, and with my health, I don’t know how I’ll be on Election Day.” — Kay Nolan and Reid J. Epstein THE EARLY VOTE When early voting began in Florida on Monday,  366,436 Floridians went to the polls and cast ballots in person, according to data collected by the United States Elections Project. The total eclipsed the record set on the first day of early, in-person voting four years ago, when about 291,000 people cast ballots, according to The Miami Herald. Including mailed-in ballots, more than three million people have now voted so far this year in Florida. That’s more than 30 percent of all the votes cast in the state in the entire 2016 election, data shows. Both parties, and campaigns up and down the ballot, are trying to figure out whether the big early numbers are likely to translate into record turnout or simply indicate that people are voting earlier than usual because of coronavirus fears and mail delays. The early data, collected by Michael P. McDonald, a professor of political science at the University of Florida, shows that registered Democrats in Florida have been far more likely to vote by mail than Republicans, suggesting that President Trump’s frequent broadsides against voting by mail may have resonated with Republicans. “This is a dynamic we’re seeing elsewhere, too,” Dr. McDonald said in an interview. But Republicans nearly tied Democrats when it came to casting ballots in person on the first day of early voting. Here is what the Florida data showed, as of early Tuesday afternoon: 3,033,702 Floridians have already voted. Turnout is already 31.7 percent of what it was in the entire 2016 election. 366,436 people had voted in person, including 154,004 Democrats and 153,743 Republicans. 2,667,266 people had voted by mail, including 1,293,994 Democrats and 812,363 Republicans. Democrats have requested 802,576 more mail-in ballots than Republicans. — Michael Cooper More than two decades of scandals and blunders have made Florida the nation’s elections punchline, the state that kept the world at the edge of its seat while votes for president were manually recounted. “I feel like I’ve seen this movie before,” a federal judge, Mark E. Walker, wrote this month after Florida’s voter registration site crashed under the weight of thousands of last-minute applications. Now the state faces an election conducted in the midst of a pandemic, amid unsubstantiated fraud claims spread by the president and others. Reasonable predictions suggest that wrangling over the results could stretch far beyond election night. Is Florida ready? Elections officials say yes. With the snafus of years past, they say, have come lessons that prepared the state to process a crush of mail ballots and juggle coronavirus-era logistics, from securing drop boxes to distributing sanitizer. But this is Florida, the nation’s biggest presidential battleground and a mirror of American polarization, where winning an election by more than a percentage point is considered a landslide. And where, to crib Faulkner, the past is never really past. The most pressing concern is the expected surge in mail ballots — and in envelopes with missing or problematic signatures. Florida allows voters to “cure” deficient ballots, but that requires time for supervisors to notify them. If that vulnerability is obvious, others are less so. Attacks by Russian hackers in at least two counties in 2016 have never been fully explained, raising questions about whether the state might still be vulnerable, despite security upgrades. Civil rights groups complain that Republican leaders are creating last-minute obstacles for voters who want to use drop boxes and for former felons who recently regained their voting rights. And the prospect of citizens flocking to stake out polling stations in response to unsubstantiated rhetoric about possible fraud has prompted elections supervisors to meet with law enforcement on keeping the polls safe. “Florida has very good laws about voter intimidation,” said Mark Earley, a supervisor in Tallahassee. “I’m a little bit more concerned about party heads responding to the noise. We don’t need help, OK? More people with high emotional levels is not a recipe for helping a supervisor of elections office. Let us do our jobs.” — Patricia Mazzei and Frances Robles A shift against President Trump among white college-educated voters in Georgia has imperiled Republicans up and down the ballot, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll released Tuesday, as Republicans find themselves deadlocked or trailing in Senate races where their party was once considered the favorite. In the presidential race, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Trump were tied at 45 percent among likely voters, unchanged from a Times/Siena poll last month. But over the same period, Senator David Perdue’s lead evaporated against his Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff, while another Democrat, the Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, pulled ahead in a special election for the state’s other Senate seat. Mr. Ossoff is now tied with Mr. Perdue, who led by four percentage points a month ago, at 43 percent. The race will head to a January runoff if no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote, making the standing of Shane Hazel, the Libertarian candidate who held 4 percent of the vote in the survey, potentially crucial to the outcome. The survey, conducted from Oct. 13 to 19, found that Mr. Perdue’s favorability ratings declined significantly since the last Times/Siena poll of the state, though it found no immediate evidence of a shift in Mr. Ossoff’s favor after Mr. Perdue made national headlines by mocking the first name of the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, on Oct. 16. The special election for Senate, meanwhile, is all but certain to go to a January runoff, with no candidate near 50 percent. Dr. Warnock has opened a comfortable 32-23 percent lead over Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican who was appointed to the seat, with Representative Doug Collins, another Republican, in third at 17 percent. The findings are the latest indication that Democrats could be on the cusp of realizing their often tantalizing but elusive dream of a Blue Georgia. A victory there for Mr. Biden would doom the president in his bid for re-election, and even one Senate victory could be the difference in giving Democrats control of the Senate. The Trump campaign has run millions of dollars’ worth of often uncontested television advertisements to hold a state that he carried by five percentage points in 2016; the results suggest that his efforts have done little to nudge the state in his favor. The poll’s margin error was plus or minus 4.1 percentage points. — Nate Cohn A federal appeals court ruled Monday that Texas election officials can continue to reject mail-in ballots because of perceived signature discrepancies without giving voters a chance to correct them. The ruling reversed a Federal District Court judge’s ruling last month that it was unconstitutional to reject a mail-in ballot because of a possible signature mismatch if the voter was not first informed of the problem and offered the opportunity to address it. The appeals judges, from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, wrote that the lower court’s ruling “takes it upon itself to rewrite” the state’s procedures. “Texas’s strong interest in safeguarding the integrity of its elections from voter fraud far outweighs any burden the state’s voting procedures place on the right to vote,” the appeals court held. The three-judge panel stayed the injunction that had been issued by the District Court pending a further order from the appeals court. Monday’s was just the latest in a flurry of decisions handed down by courts in recent weeks related to voting in the November election, several of which have made casting a ballot more difficult amid the pandemic, which is scaring many voters away from polling stations. There is an ongoing legal battle in Texas over Gov. Greg Abbott’s effort to limit the number of drop boxes that each county in the state can offer. There have also been legal disputes over the availability of and ease of access to mail-in voting in the state and when early, in-person voting should be allowed to begin. Texas has long been reliably Republican, but the race for president is relatively close there this year — President Trump leads Joseph R. Biden Jr. by only a few points in the polls — and the Republican Senator John Cornyn’s re-election race is fairly competitive. — Matt Stevens Democrats are considering boycotting a Senate Judiciary Committee vote on Thursday to approve the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court, a symbolic move designed to protest the Republican rush to confirm President Trump’s nominee before Election Day. A day after they tried unsuccessfully to shut down the Senate, Democrats were plotting more procedural tactics to throw sand in the gears of Republicans’ swift confirmation timetable and draw voters’ attention to the pre-election push to install a conservative justice who would tip the court’s majority to the right. Democrats have conceded that they do not have the votes to block or substantially delay Judge Barrett’s confirmation. Still, if they followed through with their idea of skipping the committee vote on Thursday, Republicans would be forced to postpone it or break the panel’s rules requiring the presence of Democrats to conduct official business. Party leaders were also contemplating a repeat of a maneuver they attempted on Monday, in which they tried to force the Senate to adjourn until Nov. 9, the week after the election. Republicans blocked them then and would do so again. Democrats believe that dilatory tactics can help make their case to voters that Republicans are shredding Senate norms in a mad dash to install her and cement a 6-to-3 conservative majority at a time when millions of voters have already cast their ballots. “The overwhelming feeling right now is no more business as usual,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the judiciary panel. “Our tools and time are limited, but we are determined to use every one of them, even if they seem somewhat unorthodox.” Republicans have trudged on unperturbed, dispensing with Democrats’ procedural maneuvers as they arise. After the Judiciary Committee’s vote on Thursday, votes on confirming Judge Barrett are expected to begin in the full Senate on Friday and run through early next week. Republicans appear to have the votes they need to confirm her, despite unified Democratic opposition. Before then, Judge Barrett is scheduled to resume courtesy visits with Republican senators. Senators John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska this week will join dozens of senators in both parties who have already met with Judge Barrett. — Nicholas Fandos President Trump and the first lady will campaign on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, one of the key battleground states where Joseph R. Biden Jr. leads in the polls exactly two weeks before Election Day. Mr. Trump trails Mr. Biden, his Democratic opponent, in all of the swing states that he carried in 2016, according to a New York Times snapshot of polling averages. That includes Pennsylvania, where Mr. Biden’s polling lead is averaging eight percentage points. At his airport rally in Erie, Pa., on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump was planning to be joined by the first lady, Melania Trump, in her first public appearance since recovering from the coronavirus, but  on Tuesday afternoon she canceled, with an aide citing a lingering cough. Mr. Biden, who was born in Pennsylvania and has been trying to flip blue-collar voters there who supported Mr. Trump four years ago, is not expected to make any public appearances before the final presidential debate on Thursday in Nashville. But as the debate nears, his presence is looming large over Mr. Trump’s campaign. On Monday, Mr. Trump unleashed a torrent of anger about Mr. Biden and the business practices of his son Hunter Biden during a morning conference call with campaign staff members that several reporters listened in on. Mr. Trump also called Mr. Biden “a criminal” during a rally in Arizona, and his re-election campaign announced a $55 million advertising blitz that will focus on reaching older voters in battleground states — a demographic that polls suggest is moving toward Mr. Biden. Mr. Trump’s Pennsylvania rally comes a day after the Supreme Court let stand a ruling by the state’s highest court that allowed election officials to count some mailed ballots received up to three days after Election Day, citing the pandemic and postal delays. The ruling is a major victory for Democrats who have been pushing to expand access to voting in the pandemic, and for a party that has been requesting absentee ballots in far greater numbers than Republicans. Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania’s attorney general, said on Monday that the ruling “makes clear our law will stand despite repeated attacks.” “With nearly a million votes already cast in Pennsylvania,” he added, “we support the Court’s decision not to meddle in our already-working system.” The ruling was a defeat for Pennsylvania Republicans who had asked the Supreme Court to intervene. Yet the court’s action — the result of a deadlock — suggested that Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, could play a decisive role in election disputes if she is confirmed to the court as expected next week. — Mike Ives, Adam Liptak and Nick Corasaniti THE STATE OF THE STATES President Trump is headed back to Pennsylvania Tuesday evening for a rally in a state he narrowly won in 2016, and hopes to hold in his column this year. Current Pennsylvania polls show that Joseph R. Biden Jr. is leading Mr. Trump by an average of 7 percentage points, according to the Upshot’s calculator. Here is how the state is doing on two of the biggest issues of the day: the coronavirus and the economy. Pennsylvania has reported at least 189,970 cases, the 11th most in the nation, and 8,591 deaths, the nation’s eighth highest death toll, since the beginning of the pandemic, according to a New York Times database. And the virus is surging there again: over the past week, there have been an average of 1,514 cases per day, an increase of 42 percent from the average two weeks earlier, according to the database — a level the state has not seen since April. Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate in September was 8.1 percent, according to data collected by Moody’s Analytics, above the national average of 7.9 percent. The situation has improved since April, when the state’s unemployment rate hit 16.1 percent. But to answer one of the most basic questions of a re-election campaign — are you better off today than you were four years ago? — unemployment in the state is higher than it was in September 2016, when it stood at 5.4 percent. — Michael Cooper  Joseph R. Biden Jr. holds a nine-point lead over President Trump amid widespread public alarm about the trajectory of the coronavirus pandemic and demand among voters for large-scale government action to right the economy, according to a national poll of likely voters conducted by The New York Times and Siena College. With just two weeks left in the campaign, Mr. Trump does not hold an edge on any of the most pressing issues at stake in the election, leaving him with little room for a political recovery absent a calamitous misstep by Mr. Biden, the Democratic nominee, in the coming days. The president has even lost his longstanding advantage on economic matters: Voters are now evenly split on whether they have more trust in him or Mr. Biden to manage the economy. On all other subjects tested in the poll, voters preferred Mr. Biden over Mr. Trump by modest or wide margins. Mr. Biden, the former vice president, is favored over Mr. Trump to lead on the coronavirus pandemic by 12 points, and voters trust Mr. Biden over Mr. Trump to choose Supreme Court justices and to maintain law and order by six-point margins. Americans see Mr. Biden as more capable of uniting the country by nearly 20 points. Joe Biden leads Donald Trump among most groups, and Mr. Biden is notably ahead among voters age 45 and older, who typically lean Republican. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely voters in the United States from Oct. 15 to 18. Over all, Mr. Biden is backed by 50 percent of likely voters, the poll showed, compared with 41 percent for Mr. Trump and 3 percent divided among other candidates.Most of all, the survey makes clear that crucial constituencies are poised to reject Mr. Trump because they cannot abide his conduct, including 56 percent of women and 53 percent of white voters with college degrees who said they had a very unfavorable impression of Mr. Trump — an extraordinary level of antipathy toward an incumbent president. — Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin As Americans head to the polls in states across the country for early voting, a New York Times/Siena College survey of the country released Tuesday showed just how divided the voting process is shaping up to be this year. Roughly one-third of voters said they planned to vote in person on Election Day. Nearly as many said they had already cast an early ballot, and about another third said they still planned to vote early — either in person or by mail. An intractable gender divide has come to define this election season, and it plays out in voting habits as well as in vote choice. Although they were no more likely than men to report having voted already, women were nearly 20 percentage points likelier to say they planned to vote before Election Day, the poll found. Of the more than two-thirds of male likely voters who have not yet voted, a majority plan to vote in person on Nov. 3, compared to just 41 percent of their female counterparts. Perhaps related, men tended to express a lower level of concern about the coronavirus: Fifty-eight percent of female voters said that they thought the worst of the virus was still to come, but just 44 percent of male voters agreed. Asked which candidate they trusted to handle five separate political issues, women chose Joseph R. Biden Jr. over President Trump on each one by no fewer than 13 percentage points. On the question of who would better unify the country, female voters were more than twice as likely to choose Mr. Biden than to pick Mr. Trump. Men tended to favor the president on most issues, although on unifying America and handling the coronavirus pandemic they were basically split. Looking simply at vote choice, Mr. Trump’s advantages among men and white voters, at six points each, are not much changed from a Times/Siena poll last month. And they’re an insufficient counterweight to Mr. Biden’s strength among women and nonwhite voters. With nonwhite women in particular, Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump, 70 percent to 20 percent. — Giovanni Russonello Melania Trump, the first lady, was expected to accompany President Trump to his rally in Erie, Pa., on Tuesday evening, but canceled her campaign stop hours before the event because she has a lingering cough, according to an administration official. Mrs. Trump, who had the coronavirus earlier this month, announced last week that she had tested negative. She has not joined her husband at a rally since his re-election “kick-off” rally in June 2019, and she was set to appear with him in a state that is essential to his re-election chances. Outside of her speech at the Republican National Convention, Mrs. Trump has resisted the campaign’s requests for more of her time headlining fund-raisers or other events for her husband. “Mrs. Trump continues to feel better every day following her recovery from Covid-19,” said Stephanie Grisham, her chief of staff. “But with a lingering cough, and out of an abundance of caution, she will not be traveling today.” Mr. Trump spent Monday attacking Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease specialist, and said, despite signs that the nation was headed toward another coronavirus peak, that people were “tired” of hearing about the virus from “these idiots” in the government. — Annie Karni President Trump called on the attorney general on Tuesday to take action against his political opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., over his son’s foreign work, an extraordinary push to use the levers of the federal government to sway an election in its final days. “We’ve got to get the attorney general to act,” Mr. Trump said on the show “Fox and Friends,” when asked whether he wants to see investigations into unverified information about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter that the president’s personal lawyer claims he recently obtained from Hunter’s laptop. “He’s got to act. And he’s got to act fast,” Mr. Trump said of Attorney General William P. Barr, calling on him to appoint a special prosecutor or a similar official. “This is major corruption, and this has to be known about before the election. And, by the way, we’re doing very well. We’re going to win the election.” A spokesman for Mr. Biden declined to comment. Last week, The New York Post published an unsubstantiated article based on material provided by allies to Mr. Trump claiming that when the elder Biden was vice president in 2015, he met with an adviser to a Ukrainian energy company on whose board Hunter Biden served. Mr. Biden’s campaign rejected the assertion and said his schedule showed no meeting with the adviser. A call for authorities to take action against a political opponent is remarkable, especially two weeks before a presidential election. A day earlier, Mr. Trump repeatedly called his opponent “a criminal,” using the same word for a reporter he chided for not focusing on the Post story. The president has repeatedly called on Mr. Barr to intervene in issues since he was confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Biden is leading or tied with Mr. Trump in nearly every public poll in the battleground states that handed Mr. Trump his 2016 victory. Mr. Biden has significantly cut into Mr. Trump’s edge on issues like the economy, and the president’s poor performance in handling the pandemic has brought his poll numbers down. The president made the comments during an interview in which his answers were studded with lies and falsehoods about a range of issues, and in which he criticized the Bidens, the news media and the infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony S. Fauci. After spending Monday attacking Dr. Fauci, who remains popular in public opinion polls, Mr. Trump claimed Tuesday he was “not at odds” with him, before renewing the attacks. The president falsely described Dr. Fauci as a “Democrat,” and claimed he was a “good friend” of the family of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York. “He’s been there for a long time, I leave him there, and he’s been wrong,” Mr. Trump said of Dr. Fauci. He then accused reporters of favoring Dr. Fauci “because they think he’s against me.” — Maggie Haberman AD WATCH A series of ads featuring poll workers and election officials begins airing Tuesday, meant to assure Americans that the voting process is safe and secure. The $1.7 million campaign was produced by VoteSafe, a bipartisan voting rights group, and it says as much about the national psyche as it does about the political race. In one ad, Sue from Pennsylvania introduces herself as “an Army wife, a mother, a grandmother and a die-hard believer in our right to vote.” She is not a politician, she says. She is a poll worker, who has worked in Pennsylvania for the last eight years. As she is shown setting up a polling location and placing bilingual “Vote Aquí/Here” signs outside a community center near Easton, Pa., Sue addresses concerns about whether voting will be secure this November. Her answer is clear. “I know the process. I have seen it up close,” Sue says. “It is safe, it is secure, and I promise I am going to protect your vote as if it was my own.” Election officials across the country have faced unprecedented difficulties in shoring up trust in the November elections amid the pandemic and a constant flood of misinformation and falsehoods about the election from the Trump campaign and conservative media outlets. Though some states face a shortage of money and poll workers and the threat of foreign interference is real, the vote-casting process remains both safe and secure, and voter fraud in the United States is exceptionally rare. Digital ads are targeting independent voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida. The campaign is also airing daily on Fox News in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. The constant attacks by the president on the nation’s electoral system have started to wear on public faith in the process. But rather than turn to celebrities or lawmakers to defend the system, VoteSafe’s use of trusted and familiar local elections workers could help the ads land among an increasingly skeptical public. — Nick Corasaniti One evening last month, about 100,000 people watched and donated to a virtual fund-raiser for the Biden campaign featuring Hillary Clinton, Senator Kamala Harris, and two actors who portrayed them on “Saturday Night Live,” Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph. By all accounts, the small-donor event was a success: It raised $4.4 million. That same night, Joseph R. Biden Jr. beamed into a more intimate affair of fewer than two dozen people, hosted by the billionaire financier Haim Saban. Tickets cost half a million dollars apiece. It raised even more: $4.5 million. While Mr. Biden’s campaign has trumpeted the small donations flooding in at record rates, the elite world of billionaires and multimillionaires has remained a critical cog in the Biden money machine. And as the size of checks has grown, the campaign has become less transparent, declining so far to disclose the names of its most influential check collectors, known as bundlers. From Hollywood to Silicon Valley to Wall Street, Mr. Biden’s campaign has aggressively courted the megadonor class. It has raised almost $200 million from donors who gave at least $100,000 to his joint operations with the Democratic Party in the last six months — about twice as much as President Trump raised from six-figure donors in that time, according to an analysis of new federal records. — Shane Goldmacher A poll worker in Memphis was fired last week after he improperly turned away several voters wearing T-shirts that said “Black Lives Matter” and “I Can’t Breathe,” a local election official said. The official, Suzanne Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Shelby County Election Commission, said in an interview Monday night that although Tennessee law prohibited voters from wearing clothing with the names of active candidates or political parties, the rule did not apply to social justice expressions. The voters should have been allowed to cast their ballots, she said. “Frankly, we were horrified when we learned that,” Ms. Thompson said. “So we took immediate action. No one should ever be turned away from a polling location.” Each state creates its own laws about political campaigning at polling places. Several states ban buttons and signs, while others go further and regulate dress codes. Some states forbid mentions of specific candidates, while others disallow any statements on political issues. Voters who violate state law could be turned away, and on rare occasions people have been arrested after refusing poll workers’ instructions to cover up. Find the laws in your state here. In 2018, the Supreme Court struck down a Minnesota law that prohibited political statements on apparel, even on broad issues like gun rights or labor unions. In a cautious 7-to-2 decision, the court acknowledged the value of decorum and solemn deliberation as voters prepare to cast their ballots. But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that Minnesota’s law was not “capable of reasoned application.” The court found that the Minnesota law was too difficult to parse, for example by allowing a rainbow T-shirt unless a gay rights issue was on the ballot. The ruling allowed states to enforce more narrowly written restrictions. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
