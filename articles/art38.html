Calling Trump a ‘coward,’ Biden campaign seizes on a report that he insulted fallen soldiers. The White House tried to rescind an order to lower flags to half-staff after John McCain died, a former official says. Veterans and military families react to the report on Trump’s comments. In Kenosha this week, the contrast between Trump and Biden was strong. Trump’s advice to vote twice gives state elections officials new headaches. WILMINGTON, Del. — A visibly angry Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Friday lashed President Trump over reporting that Mr. Trump had made extraordinarily disrespectful remarks about fallen soldiers, saying that such words would confirm that the Republican is unfit to serve as commander-in-chief. The comments came a day after a report by The Atlantic that Mr. Trump had referred to American soldiers killed in combat during World War I as “losers” and “suckers” and had repeatedly shown disdain for military service at other points in his presidency. Mr. Trump has  denied the reporting. “If what is written in The Atlantic is true, it’s disgusting,” Mr. Biden said in remarks he delivered in a gymnasium a short drive from his home. “It affirms what most of us believe to be true: that Donald Trump is not fit to be commander in chief.” Ticking through a list of other well-documented instances in which Mr. Trump has dismissed the sacrifices of military veterans, including those of the late Senator John McCain, Mr. Biden continued, “President Trump has demonstrated he has no sense of service, no loyalty to any cause other than himself.” Mr. Biden’s late son, Beau Biden, served in the Iraq war, and Mr. Biden, who is keenly attuned to the death toll of American troops, often concludes his remarks with the phrase, “May God protect our troops.” A palpably outraged Mr. Biden on Friday noted his son’s service, saying that Beau Biden “wasn’t a ‘sucker.’ The servicemen and women he served with, particularly those who did not come home, were not ‘losers.’” He said that the reporting appeared to be true, calling it “damning” and saying that “I’ve just never been as disappointed in my whole career with a leader.” Military veterans often lean Republican, but in 2018 a number of the most prominent Democratic House candidates were veterans, and Mr. Biden, who has been endorsed by a long list of Republican national security experts, hopes to appeal to more voters with ties to the military. Mr. Biden’s criticism of Mr. Trump came in a speech that was otherwise focused on the economy, an area that has been a source of political strength for the president, though the ravages of the pandemic have threatened his standing on the issue. In a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday, likely voters were evenly split on whether Mr. Trump or Mr. Biden would do a better job handling the economy. Before Mr. Biden’s speech, the Labor Department provided a snapshot of the virus’s continuing economic toll. The U.S. economy added 1.4 million jobs in August, the department said, smaller than the gain of 1.7 million jobs in July. Payrolls remain more than 11 million jobs below their level before the pandemic. The unemployment rate declined to 8.4 percent, down from 10.2 percent in July and 14.7 percent in April. In response to the jobs report, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, Tim Murtaugh, said in a statement that Mr. Biden “hopes for economic ruin to buoy his political fortunes.” “While the work is not finished,” he said, “President Trump’s policies positioned us to fight through the coronavirus crisis and reopen faster than doomsayers like Biden predicted.” Thomas Kaplan reported from Wilmington, and Katie Glueck from New York. — Thomas Kaplan and Katie Glueck The Biden campaign and leading Democrats quickly seized on a report in The Atlantic that President Trump had privately referred to American soldiers who died in combat as “losers” and “suckers,” saying it revealed Mr. Trump to be a “coward” motivated by self-interest rather than self-sacrifice. “If, what is written in The Atlantic is true, it’s disgusting,” Joseph R. Biden Jr said. “It affirms what most of us believe to be true, that Donald Trump is not fit to be commander in chief.” Mr. Trump continued to deny the report in the Atlantic. “It was a totally fake story. And that was confirmed by many people who were actually there,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday. “I’ve done more for the military than almost anybody else.” Earlier Friday morning, on a call with reporters set up by the Biden campaign, Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat who was severely wounded while serving as a helicopter pilot in Iraq, singled out a section of the story in which Mr. Trump reportedly shunned the presence of wounded veterans at public events. “I’ll take my wheelchair and my titanium legs over his bone spurs any day,” she said, referring to the minor ailment Mr. Trump cited to obtain a medical deferment to avoid service in the Vietnam War. “I am not shocked to hear more instances of Donald Trump belittling those who have shown more bravery than he is capable of,” said Ms. Duckworth, who was among the contenders to become Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s running mate. Aides to Mr. Biden plan to make Mr. Trump’s history of disparaging service members a staple of their attacks down the homestretch, three senior Biden campaign officials said on Friday. “According to Trump, the winners in life are those who put themselves before all and the losers are those who don’t,” Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father who represented Virginia at the Democratic National Convention last month, said on the call. “His soul is that of a coward,” added Mr. Khan, who delivered a blistering rebuke of Mr. Trump at the 2016 Democratic convention, citing the legacy of sacrifice left by his son Humayun, an Army officer killed by a suicide attack in Iraq in 2004. Mr. Trump responded to that speech by saying he too had “made a lot of sacrifices,” and went on to cite his career as a developer who had built “great structures.” Late Thursday, Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic magazine, reported that Mr. Trump had canceled a scheduled 2018 appearance at a World War I cemetery in France because he was afraid the rainy weather would muss up his hair — and because he believed those who died in combat had made the foolish decision to throw away their lives. Mr. Trump said: “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers,” according to Mr. Goldberg, a longtime foreign and military affairs reporter, citing four unnamed people with “firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day.” On the same trip, the article said, he referred to American Marines slain in combat at Belleau Wood — one of the most important American engagements of the war — as “suckers” for getting killed. Mr. Trump has come under criticism before for similar remarks about veterans. In 2015, he mocked Senator John McCain’s five and a half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, saying, “He’s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.” The Associated Press confirmed some aspects of the report in The Atlantic, citing “a senior Defense Department official with firsthand knowledge of events and a senior U.S. Marine Corps officer” with knowledge of the exchanges. Marching over to reporters under the wing of Air Force One after returning from a campaign rally Thursday night, a visibly angry Mr. Trump rebutted the account and said it had been made up to damage his chances in the election. “If people really exist that would have said that, they’re lowlifes and they’re liars,” he shouted above the noise of the plane’s engines. “And I would be willing to swear on anything that I never said that about our fallen heroes. There is nobody that respects them more.” He added, “What animal would say such a thing?” — Glenn Thrush, Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman President Trump wasn’t simply furious that the flags on federal buildings had been lowered to half-staff to honor the late Senator John McCain in August 2018: He actually tried to have them raised, again, on all buildings across the country, according to a former senior official at the Department of Homeland Security. In an interview on Friday, the ex-official, Miles Taylor, said he was in Australia on a counterterrorism trip when he and others on the trip learned of Mr. McCain’s death. Soon, said Mr. Taylor, he started getting phone calls from Washington. “I get someone from the White House, a senior person there, who calls and says, ‘What is going on with the flags. The president is upset, this has gone out too soon and he doesn’t want it to happen.’” Mr. Taylor, a Trump appointee who served in the Department of Homeland Security from 2017 to 2019 and was eventually chief of staff to Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, said he was uncertain of the procedure for lowering flags to half-staff, and spotty Wi-Fi on the trip across the globe had left him somewhat out of the loop on how the president was reacting to Mr. McCain’s death (the White House had lowered its own flag on the presidential complex, only to raise it again, in what was seen at the time as a perplexing break from protocol). After some frantic middle-of-the-night research, he said, he learned that after the White House lowered its flag, D.H.S. had sent orders for all federal buildings to follow suit. “I was then asked, ‘Would you guys be able to rescind the directive?’” Mr. Taylor said. He said he told the White House official that “we would need a compelling reason for the White House to order us to do that.” “They never ended up giving us that order, but the intimation I got was, ‘This shouldn’t have happened,’” Mr. Taylor said. It was that the president “won’t want them down, and he’s angry, and look into what you would be able to do with it.” Mr. Taylor, who recently endorsed Joseph R. Biden Jr. in a video testimonial released by the group “Republican Voters Against Trump,” said that he found the episode “pretty astounding and disgusting.” Mr. Trump has angrily denied a new report in The Atlantic that said that he was furious when he saw the flags lowered to half-staff. Speaking with reporters on Thursday night, Mr. Trump insisted that he respected Mr. McCain even though they disagreed. “I was never a fan. I will admit that openly,” Mr. Trump said. But “we lowered the flags. I had to approve that, nobody else, I had to approve it.” — Annie Karni A report that President Trump chose not to visit a cemetery in France to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the battle of Belleau Wood and honor the Marines killed during it because he believed they were “losers" struck a raw nerve with veterans of the corps and military families. The response, initially, came mostly from veterans and their family members on social media who were not likely to support Mr. Trump anyway. But discussion of his comments, reported by the Atlantic late Thursday — and what they revealed about the president if proven to be true — spanned the political spectrum. Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts and a Bronze Star recipient who served four combat tours in Iraq, said the insults, which Mr. Trump has vehemently denied, were rooted in the president’s feeling of inadequacy when confronted with people willing to risk their lives for their country. “The most selfless thing you can do is put your life on the line. That is a concept so foreign to this president, he not only doesn’t get it, but actually hates it,” Mr. Moulton said in an interview. “Every time he sees a veteran, it reminds him that he is a coward. It reminds him that he lied about his feet so he wouldn’t have to go.” M.J. Hegar, the Democratic nominee for Senate in Texas and a Purple Heart recipient, called the president’s reported comments “disgraceful.” She said she was “having a very physical and visceral response to the reporting” in an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC Thursday night. “As a Medevac pilot, I Medevacked so many wounded and dying, and dead patriots who have served this country,” said Ms. Hegar, an Air Force helicopter pilot who suffered shrapnel wounds evacuating soldiers under fire from the Taliban in 2009. Some of Mr. Trump’s defenders questioned the Atlantic report — parts of which have been confirmed by other news outlets. They point out that John Bolton, the former national security adviser who has been sharply critical of Mr. Trumpt since leaving his administration, backed up the president’s claim the trip was scrapped because of inclement weather, rather antipathy toward the troops. Representative Conor Lamb, Democrat of Pennsylvania and a veteran of the Marines, said Belleau Wood was not just any battle, but a defining moment in the history of the corps. “Every Marine learns in their first weeks, probably their first days, about the importance of Belleau Wood,” he said Friday during a conference call set up by the Biden campaign. More than 1,800 Marines would die during a succession of clashes with German attackers in early June 1918. Mr. Lamb, a lawyer who served as a military prosecutor for much of his active-duty service, hedged a bit in his remarks, telling reporters that even if all the details of the Atlantic story are never fully verified by on-the-record accounts, “they are consistent with what we have heard the president say publicly multiple times.” — Glenn Thrush KENOSHA, Wis. — The usual campaign-friendly stops were spurned. There was no grilled bratwurst or Wisconsin frozen custard to eat for the cameras. The candidates’ motorcades did not pull over at Tenuta’s Deli, a 70-year-old local institution whose walls are lined with the obligatory framed photographs of visiting politicians. The campaign trail returned in a scaled-back form to Kenosha this week, as President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. arrived in town for back-to-back events, each striking a sharply different tone in a city struggling with civil unrest and the coronavirus pandemic. Here are three takeaways from a week focused on Wisconsin: Mr. Trump played to his base. The president arrived on Tuesday, crunching through the rubble of burned buildings in Kenosha’s Uptown district and meeting with a group of local officials at a high school, including the county sheriff and the city’s police chief. He did not meet with the family of Jacob Blake, who was shot by a police officer on Aug. 23 and remains in a hospital. Mr. Trump struck a law-and-order note, condemning the destruction that has scarred Kenosha. “These are not acts of peaceful protest but, really, domestic terror,” he said. Mr. Biden pressed his case that he can bridge the nation’s widening divides. When the Democratic nominee arrived on Thursday, he first met with the Blake family, a conversation that a family representative described as engaging and prayerful. Then he headed to Grace Lutheran, a church that stands out in the community for its warmth, giving away meals and household supplies to Kenosha families. In front of a carefully selected group of community leaders, Mr. Biden, too, condemned violence, but promised to focus on correcting racial disparities if elected. “I’m going to go down fighting for racial equality, equity across the board,” he said. In Kenosha, few people showed up for either candidate. This city of 100,000 people is still boarded up, frozen in place even though it has been a week since any violent unrest. Marches and protests have dwindled. And only a few relatively small, scattered groups seemed interested enough on either day to catch a glimpse of a sitting president or the former vice president. — Julie Bosman TRANSCRIPT I just spent an hour or more with the family as I got off the airplane — had an opportunity to spend some time with Jacob on the phone. He talked about how nothing was going to defeat him. How whether he walked again or not, he was not going to give up. I think ultimately what’s been unleashed with a lot of people is they understand that fear doesn’t solve problems, only hope does. I am, I really am optimistic. I promise you, win or lose, I’m going to go down fighting, I’m going to go down fighting for racial equality, equity across the board. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their creator. Well that may be what your birthright was, but it’s very different than actually being treated equally. Being treated the same. Everything from Black mortality rates and pregnancy straight to educational opportunities, and everything in between. But the country’s ready. And if they’re not, it doesn’t matter because there are certain things I ain’t going to change, certain things worth losing over. And this is something worth losing over — if we have to — but we’re not going to lose. Drawing a sharp contrast with President Trump, Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday aligned himself strongly and sympathetically with protesters of racial injustice and with Black voters during an afternoon of raw interactions with people in Kenosha, Wis., who are still grappling with the police shooting of Jacob Blake. The former vice president repudiated Mr. Trump’s divisive approach to matters of racial injustice and civil unrest and offered an alternative vision focused on national unity. In his first day of campaigning outside his home state of Delaware or neighboring Pennsylvania since the coronavirus pandemic hit in March, Mr. Biden met for about an hour with Mr. Blake’s family and legal team immediately after landing in the critical battleground state of Wisconsin, and spoke with Mr. Blake himself by phone. Mr. Biden also hosted a listening session with activists, elected officials, clergy members, businesspeople and a few law enforcement officers, aiming to appeal to a broader cross-section of the community than Mr. Trump did on his trip. The former vice president emphasized his commitment to correcting decades of systemic racism, as he acknowledged racial disparities in health care, education and the criminal justice system and said that “we’re finally now getting to the point” of addressing “the original sin: slavery. And all the vestiges of it.” “Win or lose, I’m going to go down fighting,” Mr. Biden said as he described the possibility of a more just future. “I’m going to go down fighting for racial equality, equity across the board.” — Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Katie Glueck President Trump on Thursday reiterated his desire to “get along” with Moscow despite an international uproar over the poisoning of the Russian dissident Aleksei A. Navalny with a deadly nerve agent, saying that when the subject of Russia appears on the news, he turns it off. Speaking at a small campaign rally in Latrobe, Pa., Mr. Trump did not mention Mr. Navalny on a day when his press secretary issued a stern statement about the apparent assassination attempt against the dissident, who is the most prominent domestic critic of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Nor did he address new warnings from his own intelligence officials that Russia is seeking to interfere in the 2020 election on his behalf. Instead, he boasted that he had kept the United States “out of wars,” and he pointed to his persistent efforts to thaw relations between Washington and Moscow. “It’s good that I get along,” Mr. Trump said. “If I get along with Russia, is that a good thing or bad thing? I think it’s a good thing.” His remarks came hours after the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, called Mr. Navalny’s poisoning “deeply reprehensible” and said the United States would “hold those in Russia accountable wherever the evidence leads.” But she also insisted to reporters that “no one has been tougher on the Russian government than this president.” While the Trump administration has taken some punitive actions against Russia’s government, including the expulsion of diplomats and an array of economic sanctions, it has done so mainly under pressure from Congress or European allies — and often only with Mr. Trump’s grudging approval, according to several former White House officials. — Maggie Haberman Eris Eady, a project organizer at the Alliance for Safety and Justice, began a Zoom call this week with a request to the hundreds of participants: Tell us why, or for whom, you are here. The answers poured into the in-meeting chat. “For my son,” who was fatally shot. “For survivors of mental and emotional abuse.” “For myself.” “For all our Black men and boys.” And then: “For those who don’t think that voting makes a difference.” For all that narratives about crime shape American politics, crime survivors are rarely centered in the conversation, if they are heard at all. Many express a sense that their voices and their needs don’t matter at the polls, just as they didn’t matter to the person who shot, assaulted or otherwise harmed them. Hence the Zoom call, which served as the introductory event for a new campaign called #HealTheVote that aims to turn out 100,000 crime survivors for the coming election. The Alliance for Safety and Justice, an advocacy group that supports crime prevention and rehabilitation programs instead of mass incarceration, will announce the initiative on Friday. Its premise is that crime survivors are, like women or working-class voters or people with disabilities, a constituency with distinct needs that elected officials should be pushed to address — and also that engaging in the political process can help survivors themselves. The campaign is nonpartisan, and it includes both Democrats and Republicans promoting a shift away from the 1990s-era “tough on crime” approach that led to mass incarceration of people of color. — Maggie Astor With President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. dueling this week over crime, safety and unrest in American cities, a simple question was on most political observers’ minds: Which narrative will win? The answer is anything but simple for pollsters, who use straightforward questions to take a read on the national mood. How can they ask questions that drive to the heart of the debate, when neither side can even agree on its terms? In recent weeks the standard wordings have felt insufficient, and polling firms have adjusted the questions they’re asking. They’re seeking to determine which candidate’s approach resonates more — not only whether voters are truly worried that the flare-ups of urban violence will reach their homes, but also whom they blame for them and how they think they should be quelled. “What we want is good measurement, and if past measurements are out of whack with the current situation, then we have to revise them and try to test other approaches,” said Gary Langer, whose polling firm conducts research on behalf of ABC News, The Washington Post and other news outlets. An ABC News/Ipsos poll released Friday suggested that Mr. Trump’s recent efforts to cast himself as the candidate of law and order were not succeeding. The poll found that a majority of Americans — 55 percent — said that the president’s comments on the protests were making the situation worse. A larger majority — 59 percent — said that Mr. Biden would do a better job reducing violence in the country. In polls released on Thursday by Quinnipiac University from the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Florida, researchers asked voters who they thought would do a better job guiding the country through a crisis — language that intentionally wasn’t specific to the pandemic or the protests. In Pennsylvania, a slim majority still preferred Mr. Biden to command the country during a crisis, but in Florida, it was about an even split: 49 percent Mr. Biden, 47 percent Mr. Trump.  — Giovanni Russonello President Trump’s call for people to test the integrity of the elections system by trying to vote both by mail and in person has created new headaches for state election officials, who are already dealing with the formidable task of holding an election during a pandemic. Douglas A. Kellner, co-chairman of the New York State Board of Elections, accused Mr. Trump on Thursday of fueling concern in the minds of voters and, in doing so, adding more work to county elections boards already “stretched to the limit” by a presidential election and the coronavirus. “It’s hard to imagine how we could add any more stress to the system,” said Mr. Kellner, a Democrat. Maggie Sheehan, a spokeswoman for Frank LaRose, Ohio’s secretary of state, a Republican, said, “Ohio voters are encouraged to choose one way to vote, as any additional effort to cast a ballot will not be counted and unnecessarily burdens election officials.” And Jena Griswold, Colorado’s secretary of state and a Democrat, said, “2020 has been unprecedented in so many ways, but I never imagined that as secretary of state I would have to inform both the president and the U.S. attorney general that it is illegal to vote twice.” That was after Attorney General William P. Barr suggested during an interview with CNN that he was not sure whether voting twice was illegal in North Carolina. — Stephanie Saul and Nick Corasaniti In Kenosha’s week at the center of the election, the contrast between Trump and Biden was strong, but pollsters are struggling to clarify whose message is resonating most.
