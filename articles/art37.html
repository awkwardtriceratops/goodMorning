Facebook’s revenue rises 22 percent, and profits jump 29 percent. Amazon’s profits keep surging during the pandemic. Apple’s sales increase despite declining iPhone revenue. U.S. economic growth hit a quarterly record, but a shortfall remains. Nancy Pelosi urges the Treasury secretary to respond to Democrats’ demands on a relief package. Exxon Mobil will cut thousands of jobs as it contends with low oil and gas prices. Newspaper ad revenue is pummeled in the pandemic, but Fox News and ABC thrive. Twitter’s business is showing signs of recovery as advertisers, who abandoned the platform early in the pandemic, begin to return. Revenue in the third quarter was $936 million, a 14 percent improvement from the same quarter a year ago that exceeded analyst expectations of $775 million. Net income was $29 million, down 21 percent from a year ago. But user growth was sluggish. Twitter added just one million daily active users in the quarter, reaching a total of 187 million. Analysts had predicted the company would reach 195 million daily active users. “We remain confident that our larger audience, coupled with ongoing revenue product improvements, new events and product launches, and the positive advertiser response to the choices we’ve made as we have grown the service, can drive great outcomes over time,” said Ned Segal, Twitter’s chief financial officer. Twitter said it was looking for more opportunities to connect users with live experiences and said the winter season could accelerate the growth of online shopping, giving the company more advertising opportunities. But Twitter cautioned investors that the election could introduce uncertainty into advertiser spending. In the previous quarter, Twitter saw many advertisers pull their campaigns in response to widespread Black Lives Matter protests in the United States. — Kate Conger Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said on Thursday that profits in its most recent quarter rose 59 percent from a year ago, as marketers plowed money into advertisements on its internet search engine and YouTube. Alphabet posted a net profit of $11.25 billion in the third quarter as revenue rose 14 percent to $46.1 billion. Both figures far exceeded Wall Street’s expectations and Alphabet’s stock rose more than 5 percent in after-hours trading. When advertisers slowed spending with Google earlier this year as Covid-19 started to spread widely in the United States, Alphabet’s business took a significant hit. In the second quarter, Alphabet’s quarterly revenue fell from a year earlier for the first time in the company’s history. But as the economy has improved and businesses found their footing, advertisers have returned. Google remains as indispensable as ever to advertisers even as the company defends itself against an antitrust lawsuit filed earlier this month from the Justice Department. The suit accuses the company of cementing the dominance of its search engine through anticompetitive agreements with device makers and mobile carriers. — Daisuke Wakabayashi It was another blockbuster financial quarter for Facebook. The social network reported on Thursday that its revenue for the third quarter had risen 22 percent from a year earlier, to $21.2 billion, while profits jumped 29 percent to $7.84 billion. The results surpassed analysts’ estimates of $19.8 billion in revenue and profits of $5.53 billion, according to data provided by FactSet. Facebook delivered the results even after a wide-ranging boycott by advertisers this summer over issues of hate and toxic speech on the site. Though the grass-roots campaign, Stop Hate for Profit, rallied many of the top advertisers on Facebook to reduce their spending, the overall effects were brief. The company has also been dealing with increasing regulatory pressure, including a possible antitrust case from the Federal Trade Commission. The company continued gaining users as well. More than 1.82 billion people used the Facebook app every day, up 12 percent from a year earlier, the company said. In total, more than 2.54 billion people used one or more apps in Facebook’s family — Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger or Facebook — daily, up 15 percent from a year earlier. “We had a strong quarter as people and businesses continue to rely on our services to stay connected and create economic opportunity during these tough times,” said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive. “We continue to make significant investments in our products and hiring in order to deliver new and meaningful experiences for our community around the world.” Facebook is spending more as it works to secure its platform before Tuesday’s presidential election. The company said that it employed more than 56,000 people, up 32 percent from a year earlier, and that more than half of its revenue had gone to operating expenses. The threat of regulation is a point of uncertainty, Facebook said. In its earnings report, executives warned of changes to laws regarding trans-Atlantic data transfers, based on impending potential changes to European Union law. Analysts shrugged off those concerns. “Despite an ongoing boycott, small and medium-sized businesses, which make a much bigger contribution to the company’s overall sales, continued to allocate their ad dollars to Facebook,” said Jesse Cohen, a financial analyst at Investing.com. “Similar to other social media platforms, Facebook showed no signs that it was feeling the squeeze from the coronavirus pandemic.” — Mike Isaac The pandemic-fueled surge in online shopping pushed Amazon to a record for both sales and profits in the latest quarter. Sales for the third quarter were $96.1 billion, up 37 percent from a year earlier, and profits rose almost 200 percent to $6.3 billion. What’s more, the quarter did not include the usual boost from Prime Day, Amazon’s yearly deal bonanza, which was delayed to October because of the pandemic. And the profit came during a building boom, with Amazon expanding its warehousing and delivery infrastructure by 50 percent this year. The company added almost 250,000 employees in the quarter. The results far surpassed forecasts by analysts, who had expected the company to post $92.8 billion in sales and $3.8 billion in profit, according to estimates compiled by FactSet, a financial data firm. The company sold 46 percent more items and digital downloads in its store, more than twice the rate it had grown before the pandemic. Amazon Web Services, the company’s lucrative cloud computing division, grew 27 percent, as companies accelerated their shift to a model that is more accessible to work forces managing systems remotely. Amazon said sales could reach $121 billion in the fourth quarter, because of the confluence of Prime Day, the holiday shopping season and the turn to online spending because of the pandemic. — Karen Weise Apple’s sales rose slightly in the latest quarter even though the pandemic forced it to push back the iPhone 12’s release to October, highlighting the increasing strength of other parts of the company’s business. Apple said on Thursday that revenue rose 1 percent to $64.7 billion in the three months that ended on Sept. 30, despite a 20 percent drop in iPhone sales because the previous year comparison included early sales of the iPhone 11. Profits fell 7.4 percent to $12.7 billion, partly because Apple spent more on research and development. In its earnings release, Apple did not provide guidance for the current quarter, which is the figure many investors had anticipated most because it would have signaled sales expectations for the new iPhone 12. The new iPhone went on sale this month. Apple’s services business, which includes revenues from the App Store and digital offerings like Apple Music, continued to shine. Services revenue increased 16.3 percent to $14.5 billion. Apple has made that business central to its growth strategy, and it has become the company’s No. 2 revenue driver after iPhones. Sales of iPads also rose by 46 percent, Mac computers by 29 percent and wearables by 21 percent. All those products combined to make up for the decline in iPhone sales. “There are lots going on here, and everything is going incredibly well,” Luca Maestri, Apple’s finance chief, said in an interview. But the services business faces a threat. A large chunk of that revenue — about $8 billion to $12 billion a year — comes from payments from Google to make its search engine the preselected choice on iPhones. That partnership is now in jeopardy after the Justice Department sued Google this month and singled out the deal as one of the biggest ways Google unfairly edges out competitors. Apple’s revenue dip is unlikely to spook investors because it was expected, given the later-than-usual iPhone release. The company typically releases new iPhones in September. The next quarter will be the true test of how much Apple can keep its enormous iPhone business humming. For more than a year, analysts have anticipated this year’s final quarter because many customers have been waiting to upgrade their devices so they could buy the iPhone 12, which works with faster 5G wireless networks. Investors have poured money into Apple’s stock in expectations that the quarter would deliver record results, pushing the company’s valuation past $2 trillion. — Jack Nicas Stocks on Wall Street rallied on Thursday, rebounding from their worst decline in more than four months, led by gains in big technology companies. After an unsteady start, the S&P 500 rose about 1.2 percent. The index had dropped 3.53 percent on Wednesday, it’s sharpest daily decline since mid-June. The Stoxx Europe 600 ended a volatile day with a small decline. A handful of large technology companies rose ahead of their earnings reports. Twitter jumped nearly 8 percent, and was one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500. Facebook, Alphabet and Apple and Amazon were also higher and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.6 percent. But the concerns that had fueled the sell-off on Wednesday — the resurgent coronavirus pandemic in Europe and the United States — lingered in some corners of the financial markets. Crude oil prices dropped about 3 percent, adding to a more than 5 percent decline the day before. Both France and Germany announced new nationwide restrictions on Wednesday, shuttering hospitality and leisure businesses and asking people to stay at home through November. The International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for the British economy on Thursday, saying G.D.P. would decline 10.4 percent this year and grow only 5.7 percent in 2021, a deeper contraction and slower recovery than it predicted three weeks ago. In that time, a second wave of coronavirus cases went from being a theoretical risk to a reality, as it sweeps across much of Europe. The renewed focus on the pandemic has added to an already turbulent stretch for traders on Wall Street, where expectations for imminent economic aid from Washington have been dashed and concern about the upcoming presidential election are keeping many investors on the sidelines. A report on U.S. gross domestic product data for the third quarter, released Thursday, showed the fastest quarterly increase on record but revealed an incomplete recovery, with the economy still several percentage points smaller than before the pandemic. G.D.P. grew 7.4 percent in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said. Weekly unemployment claims remained elevated at 732,000. — Eshe Nelson and Matt Phillips 2019 Q4 LEVEL $20 trillion +7.4% Q2 to Q3 –9.0% Q1 to Q2 15 10 Gross domestic product, adjusted  for inflation and seasonality, at  annual rates 5 ’15 ’16 ’17 ’18 ’19 ’20 2019 Q4 LEVEL $20 trillion +7.4% Q2 TO Q3 –9.0% Q1 TO Q2 15 10 Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation and seasonality, at annual rates 5 ’15 ’16 ’17 ’18 ’19 ’20 Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis By Ella Koeze U.S. economic output grew at the fastest pace on record last quarter as businesses began to reopen and customers returned to stores. But the economy has climbed only partway out of its pandemic-induced hole, and progress is slowing. Gross domestic product grew 7.4 percent in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The gain, the equivalent of 33.1 percent on an annualized basis, was by far the biggest since reliable statistics began after World War II; the previous record was a 3.9 percent quarterly increase in 1950. Still, the economy in the third quarter remained 3.5 percent smaller than at the end of 2019, before the pandemic began. By comparison, G.D.P. shrank 4 percent over the entire year and a half of the Great Recession a decade ago. The report was the last major piece of economic data before the presidential election on Tuesday. President Trump hailed the big gain as evidence that the economy had roared back to life after the spring’s pandemic-induced shutdowns. But economists said the third-quarter figures revealed less about the strength of the recovery than about the severity of the collapse that preceded it. G.D.P. fell 1.3 percent in the first quarter and 9 percent in the second as the pandemic forced widespread business closures. A big rebound was inevitable once the economy began to reopen. The challenge is what comes next. “The reason we had such a big bounce is that the economy went from closed to partially open,” said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America. “The easy growth was exhausted, and now the hard work has to be done in terms of fully healing.” Already, there are signs that the recovery is losing steam. Industrial production fell in September and job growth has cooled, even as a growing list of major corporations have announced new rounds of large-scale layoffs and furloughs. Most economists expect the slowdown to worsen in the final three months of the year as virus cases rise and federal aid to households and businesses fades. “We’re having a record recovery, but it comes after an even more record collapse, and it looks like economic momentum is fading in the fourth quarter,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist for TD Securities. — Ben Casselman TRANSCRIPT I feel very confident that Joe Biden will be elected president on Tuesday, whatever the end count is. But on the election that occurs on Tuesday, he will be elected. On Jan. 20, he will be inaugurated president of the United States. So while we don’t want to be overconfident or assume anything, we have to be ready for how we are going to go down a different path. We’ve come to a fork in the road when it comes to the coronavirus. The president has taken us on a deadly path. The Heroes Act takes us on a scientific path to help save the lives, the livelihood and the lives of the American people. This weekend should be very interesting to see how many more people will vote in advance. I hope that people will not depend on the mail because they have done all they can to dismantle the postal system. But I salute our postal workers, our letter carriers and those who are making the best of the situation. But even the Postal Service is saying it’s too late now to mail. Well I want, I want a bill for two reasons. First and foremost, the American people need help, they need real help. And second of all, we have plenty work to do in the Joe Biden administration. We’re going to build the infrastructure of America in a green way. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said on Thursday that she wanted to reach a deal on an economic relief bill during Congress’s lame duck session after the election in order to clear the decks for a Joseph R. Biden Jr. presidency, expressing optimism despite months of faltering negotiations. “I want a bill for two reasons,” Ms. Pelosi said at her last news conference before the election. “First and foremost, the American people need help, they need real help. Second of all, we have plenty to do in a Joe Biden administration.” The comments came hours after she wrote to Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, requesting a response to key differences in the stumbling talks as small businesses continue to struggle and millions of Americans remain out of work. “Your responses are critical for our negotiations to continue,” Ms. Pelosi warned Mr. Mnuchin. Hampering the deal are a list of outstanding issues, including Democrats’ demand for aid to state and local governments, the amount of funding for schools and child care and the terms of a national testing plan that Ms. Pelosi has long sought. Despite Ms. Pelosi’s wishes, it remains unlikely that lawmakers and the administration will be able to quickly reconcile their differences, particularly given widespread conservative concern on Capitol Hill over the scope and size of the package. Ms. Pelosi, however, continued to demand responses to a number of issues, insisting that Mr. Mnuchin, the lead negotiator for the White House, agree to final language and respond to a number of Democratic demands. Ms. Pelosi said that Mr. Mnuchin had yet to agree to final testing language, despite the Treasury secretary declaring earlier this month that “we’ll fundamentally agree with their testing language.” “The president’s words that ‘after the election, we will get the best stimulus package you have ever seen’ only have meaning if he can get Mitch McConnell to take his hand off the pause button and get Senate Republican chairmen moving toward agreement with their House counterparts,” Ms. Pelosi wrote, referring to Senate Republicans’ public objections to the nearly $2 trillion framework. Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, has privately counseled the White House to hold off agreeing to a deal until after the general election. — Emily Cochrane and Nicholas Fandos Under pressure from low oil and natural gas prices, Exxon Mobil said on Thursday it would cut 1,900 jobs through voluntary and involuntary layoffs in the United States in the next several months. Exxon also said it is reducing the number of contractors it uses around the world by 14,000 over the next two years. These cuts follow large reductions by other oil and gas companies. On Wednesday, the company said it would maintain its dividend at its current level. Exxon Mobil directly employs more than 70,000 people and said the new job cuts in the United States would primarily be in its Houston management office. “These actions will improve the company’s long-term cost competitiveness and ensure the company manages through the current unprecedented market condition,” the company said in a statement that cited the drop in energy demand because of the pandemic. The U.S. benchmark oil futures contract was trading around $36 a barrel on Thursday, down from about $56 a barrel a year ago. Exxon Mobil’s stock, which has dropped sharply this year, was up about 3 percent Thursday afternoon. — Clifford Krauss Airbus reported a consolidated operating loss of 636 million euros, or $745 million, in the third quarter, but the European aerospace giant managed to stop bleeding cash and expected continued stability after adjusting its business in response to the coronavirus crisis, the company said Thursday. Chief executive, Guillaume Faury, sounded a cautiously optimistic note about the company’s future at a news briefing, a day after its rival Boeing announced plans to slash another 7,000 jobs through the end of next year, building on a much larger cut announced this spring. The European Central Bank left monetary policy unchanged following a meeting of its Governing Council on Thursday, but signaled it could take further steps to stimulate the eurozone economy in December. “In the current environment of risks clearly tilted to the downside, the Governing Council will carefully assess the incoming information, including the dynamics of the pandemic, prospects for a rollout of vaccines and developments in the exchange rate,” the bank said in a statement. Tiffany & Company said on Thursday that it has agreed to cut the price of its sale to the French conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. The settlement would end a dispute between the companies and seal one of the luxury world’s largest deals. Tiffany and LVMH agreed to a revised price of $131.50 a share, down from $135. That would bring the sale to just under $16 billion, or about $400 million less than before.  They also agreed to settle dueling lawsuits in a Delaware court. Newspaper companies have suffered even more during the pandemic than they did during the Great Recession, but revenue for television networks like ABC and Fox News has soared, according to a report released on Thursday by Pew Research Center. The combination of the pandemic and a presidential campaign meant larger audiences than usual for Fox News, CNN and MSNBC. Of the three, only the top-rated channel, Fox News, was able to translate the surge in the number of viewers into more advertising dollars. Ad sales for Fox News increased 41 percent in the second quarter of 2020, compared with the same period in 2019. At the same time, CNN had a 14 percent slump, and MSNBC’s ad sales fell by 27 percent, according to the report. Fox News has had consistently higher ad revenue than its rival cable networks since 2007, Michael Barthel, a senior researcher with Pew, wrote in an email, adding that Fox News may have been able to “provide some unique value to advertisers” because it is unmatched in its appeal to Republicans. Mr. Barthel also suggested that, during a summertime advertiser boycott of Tucker Carlson’s prime time Fox News show, companies may have shifted their ad spending to other programs on the network, rather than decamp to its competitors. Many TV networks cut back the time allotted for commercial breaks in part because companies were advertising less during the pandemic, said Gregory Aston, the head of digital media research science at Kantar Media, which provided data for Pew’s report. He added that traffic to CNN’s website surged 40 percent, while downloads of the network’s app increased 35 percent, which may have helped it “optimize its revenue opportunity.” ABC had the largest ad sales increase of the broadcast networks, with a 21 percent jump, compared with single-digit jumps for CBS and NBC, according to the report. But ad revenue sank by a median of 42 percent at Gannett, McClatchy, The New York Times Company and three other publicly traded newspaper companies that collectively own more than 300 daily papers. Tribune Publishing had a year-over-year decline of 48 percent. Digital ads failed to support the publications, as sales plunged 32 percent. Political ads for local television, as well as retransmission fees paid by cable providers, helped buffer local television owners from the effects of the pandemic, according to the report. But overall advertising revenue slipped for five companies, including Sinclair Broadcast Group and Tegna, that collectively own 600 stations. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
