Trump is greeted by protesters and supporters as he arrives in Kenosha. The president’s trip risks further unrest and represents a consequential political bet. Biden will visit Kenosha ‘soon,’ the D.N.C. chairman says. Trump compares officers who shoot people to golfers who ‘choke’ and floats baseless ‘dark shadows’ theory about Biden. Trump’s conspiracy theory claims have floated around online for months. Biden is expected to shatter records with more than $300 million raised in August. Trump has won another delay in turning over his tax returns. A poll finds people who consume conservative media are less likely to wear masks. As President Trump arrived in Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday afternoon, on a trip to survey a city that was thrown into tumult first by a police shooting and then by the killing of two protesters, he was greeted by a mixture of protesters and supporters. If the president’s trip was meant to highlight the issues of law and order he has made central to his re-election campaign, it was threatened to be overshadowed by a series of comments he made on Monday. Mr. Trump likened the police officer who shot Jacob Blake in the back, setting off protests, to a golfer who choked on an easy putt. And the president declined to denounce a 17-year-old who was charged with killing two protesters during a night of unrest in the city last week. A crowd of Black Lives Matter activists mixed with Trump supporters gathered in downtown Kenosha, occasionally chanting in each other’s faces and hurling insults as they awaited the president’s arrival. “This is just ridiculous,” said John Crisman, who drove in from nearby Paddock Lake, Wis. “I was just standing here with my sign and some old lady started telling me that Black lives don’t matter, all lives matter. It’s just disheartening to see all this.” Several dozen of Mr. Trump’s fans, wearing red caps and waving American flags, cheered as the president drove by, then immediately headed back to their cars. “How often do you get to see a president?” asked Dan Dowd of Long Grove, Ill., as he and his wife, Diane, left the gathering. He dismissed the protesters’ suggestion that conservatives were inciting violence. “The right is tolerant — all the violence is coming from the left,” he said, motioning toward a parking lot of cars that had been burned last week during the unrest. “There ought to be a way to express feelings without burning businesses to the ground.” Representative Mark Pocan, a Democrat and Kenosha native, stood outside a library downtown earlier Tuesday and said he hoped that Mr. Trump would bring with him a message of unity. “It would be great to find his inner spirit, hopefully,” Mr. Pocan said. “Donald Trump takes care of Donald Trump all too often. It would be nice if Donald Trump took care of Kenosha for a change.” Kejuan Goldsmith, an activist, said that a large crowd of demonstrators would gather outside the Kenosha County courthouse in the afternoon, with a presence that he hoped would prevail over Mr. Trump’s message. “We don’t want any of the negativity,” Mr. Goldsmith said. “I know he’s going to try to turn all this positivity into negativity. But we’re out here fighting. We’re doing this because we demand justice.” Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, a Democrat, had asked Mr. Trump to put off his visit, but the president proceeded anyway. Mr. Evers announced a measure to help the city recover from last week’s unrest: businesses that were damaged by fires or other vandalism will be eligible to apply for $20,000 interest-free loans for rebuilding. The governor called a special session in the state capital of Madison on Monday to address police reform, but Republican legislators, who hold a majority, chose not to participate. No votes or debates took place. — Julie Bosman and Michael Cooper The corner where Jacob Blake was shot turned into a community festival on Tuesday, led by family members and activists who wanted to promote community healing, but also to offer a tacit rebuke to President Trump’s visit to Kenosha. “We know why Trump is here in Kenosha today,” Tanya McLean, an organizer of the event, told the crowd of hundreds that had gathered. “He is here to sow chaos and fear. We reject these attempts to divide us.” The president was trying to distract from the failures of his administration, Ms. McLean added, including the coronavirus crisis, growing unemployment and “the state sanctioned violence that denies Black Americans our right to freedom and a safe and healthy life.” Those in attendance included Justin Blake, Mr. Blake’s uncle, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Mr. Jackson had spent time with the young organizers in recent days to offer advice on strategy. “I met with the leadership to convince them to not demonstrate today,” Mr. Jackson said. “If they demonstrate, it would be a big mistake. Trump would use it as a commercial.” Instead of images of unrest and upheaval, the gathering carried the feel of a carnival. There were bounce houses for the children and the smell of grilled meat wafted through the air. There were booths offering Covid-19 testing, voter registration and reiki therapy. A D.J. played music. The spot where Mr. Blake was shot while leaning into his car more than a week ago was now occupied by a white truck with a sign across the front that read, “Think Big.” — John Eligon President Trump’s trip to Kenosha, Wis.,  on Tuesday threatened to roil the delicate conditions on the ground there and to rattle his own re-election campaign, a day after he declined to denounce a 17-year-old white gunman who is charged with killing two people during a night of unrest in the city last week. Mr. Trump’s comments about the teenage gunman, made in the White House briefing room on Monday, came amid a series of developments that undercut his law-and-order campaign message and left his aides straining to defend the president’s public behavior. His apparent sympathy for a teenager charged with murder, who spoke openly about seeing himself as a kind of vigilante, may upend a national debate over criminal justice and safety that Republicans hope will work to their advantage in the presidential race. The president’s remarks came hours after his Democratic challenger, Joseph R. Biden Jr., had challenged Mr. Trump to condemn acts of violence coming from the political right. Mr. Trump did not do so. In addition to making forgiving comments about the teenager, Kyle Rittenhouse,  who attended a Trump rally earlier this year, Mr. Trump defended supporters of his who fired paintball pellets and pepper spray into a crowd in Portland, Ore. On Monday, Mr. Biden denounced social disorder of all stripes in his strongest language yet — “It’s lawlessness, plain and simple, and those who do it should be prosecuted,” he said — and accused Mr. Trump of fomenting violence for political purposes. “Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is re-elected?” Mr. Biden asked, trying to turn Mr. Trump’s public safety-themed arguments against him. Any traditional president would be expected to play a calming and consoling role while visiting an American city that is still reeling from a police shooting and ensuing civil disorder. There is little expectation that Mr. Trump’s presence will act as a balm on the situation. On the contrary, the president has indicated at every turn that he intends to turn the events in Kenosha into a weapon of political division. Even before his comments in the briefing room, Mr. Trump was criticizing local Democratic leaders in Wisconsin and other places where some protests have turned violent, maintaining a drumbeat of ominous and misleading messaging that defined the Republican convention last week. He attacked “radical left mayors and governors” on Twitter, blaming them for unruly demonstrations and incidences of rioting. While it remained to be seen what exactly Mr. Trump might do and say in Kenosha, one omission from his itinerary is clear enough: He is not expected to meet with members of the Blake family.  — Alexander Burns Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said on Tuesday that Joseph R. Biden Jr. planned to visit Kenosha “as soon as possible” to help calm the roiled Wisconsin city — and slammed President Trump’s trip there as an attempt to fuel “hate.” Mr. Perez, speaking on a conference call with reporters, said Mr. Biden’s team was working on plans for a visit, “but he wants to make sure he gets to talk to everyone,” including the families of two protesters killed in a confrontation last week. Mr. Perez, who headed the Justice Department’s civil rights division under former President Barack Obama, cited Mr. Trump’s defense of the teenager accused of killing the protesters as evidence that “hate has become mainstream with President Trump’s blessing.” Local officials, including Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, had called for Mr. Trump to cancel or delay his visit, as Mr. Biden has done. Earlier in the day, Symone Sanders, a top Biden aide, said in a CNN interview that he would travel to Wisconsin “very soon,” but that he “doesn’t want to do anything that would create a tussle, if you will, on the ground.” Janet Napolitano, a former Homeland Security secretary under Mr. Obama who was on the call, said that Mr. Biden “won’t be there to incite violence, he won’t be there to bigfoot a governor and a mayor” and he is not going there “to save a campaign.” Mr. Perez also called out Mr. Trump’s assertion, during an interview on Fox News Monday, that police officers who shoot people were comparable to golfers who “choke” when trying to sink a “three-foot putt.” “When he isn’t lining up his own putt, he is sowing division,” Mr. Perez said of the president.    — Glenn Thrush and Thomas Kaplan President Trump compared instances of the police shooting people to golfers who “choke” when trying to sink “a three-foot putt” when speaking about the shooting of Jacob Blake during an unrestrained interview on Fox News late Monday. The president also floated a vague, baseless conspiracy theory that powerful people in the “dark shadows” were behind Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign as well as protests in Kenosha and other cities, echoing themes struck by his supporters in the QAnon movement.   Mr. Trump’s remarks — which seemed to alarm even his sympathetic interviewer, Laura Ingraham — came as Wisconsin officials implored him to scrap or postpone his visit to Kenosha today, out of concern his presence could provoke violence and stoke unrest. In comparable times of crisis, presidents have attempted to ease tensions, and Mr. Biden has asked protesters on both sides to eschew violence. Mr. Trump, who has expressed his appreciation for conservative counterprotesters —  many of whom have been waving Trump-Pence flags — has not taken that approach. At one point in their interview, when Ms. Ingraham asked Mr. Trump who was behind Mr. Biden’s campaign, he replied, “People that you’ve never heard of, people that are in the dark shadows.” She responded, “That sounds like a conspiracy theory.” “There are people that are on the streets, there are people that are controlling the streets,” Mr. Trump said. “We had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend. And in the plane, it was almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that.” There were “a lot of the people were on the plane to do big damage,” Mr. Trump said. He provided no evidence for his claims. When Ms. Ingraham asked for more detail, he said the matter was still under investigation, adding, “I’ll tell you sometime.” Asked about his comments before boarding Air Force One bound for Kenosha on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump was hardly any clearer about who he claimed had told him that. “I could tell you that I can probably refer you to the person and they could do it,” he told reporters. “I would like to ask that person if it was OK. The person on the plane said there were about six people like that person or more or less and what happened is the entire plane filled up with the looters, the anarchists, rioters, people looking for trouble. The person felt very uncomfortable on the plane. It is a person you know. I’ll see whether or not I can get that person to speak to you.” When Ms. Ingraham asked Mr. Trump about violence toward the police, the president said that officers in the U.S. were under siege because they occasionally “choke” and make mistakes. “They can do 10,000 great acts, which is what they do, and one bad apple, or a choker, you know, a choker, they choke,” the president said. “Shooting the guy in the back many times,” he continued, referencing what happened to Mr. Blake, “I mean, couldn’t you have done something different, couldn’t you have wrestled him? You know, I mean, in the meantime he might’ve been going for a weapon. You know there’s a whole big thing there, but they choke. Just like in a golf tournament, they miss a three-foot putt.” Ms. Ingraham, who repeatedly interrupted Mr. Trump during their interview to give him a chance to tone down his comments, tried to stop him as he was saying the word “putt.” “You’re not comparing it to golf? Because of course that’s what the media will say,” she said. “I’m saying people choke,” Mr. Trump said. “You’ve got a quarter of a second to make a decision. If you don’t make the decision and you’re wrong, you’re dead.” That Mr. Trump would choose to use a golf metaphor is not surprising. The president, who owns luxury courses around the globe, has played more than 275 rounds since taking office, a far greater rate than his predecessor, President Barack Obama. — Glenn Thrush In a wide-ranging interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Monday night, President Trump spread multiple baseless conspiracy theories about the protests that have erupted across the nation. He claimed that a plane “loaded with thugs” tried to disrupt the Republican National Convention. He said that “some very stupid rich people” have been financing the racial justice protests that took place in Washington last week and around the country in recent months. And he alleged, without evidence, that “people you haven’t heard of” are controlling Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee. All of these can be traced back to false conspiracy narratives that have swirled online in recent months. There is no evidence of a flight matching Mr. Trump’s description. But the claim is similar to a baseless allegation from an Emmett, Idaho, man, who posted to Facebook on June 1. “Be ready for attacks downtown and residential areas. At least a dozen males got off the plane in Boise from Seattle, dressed head to toe in black.” He claimed, “One had a tattoo that said ‘Antifa America’ on his arm.” That same day, the local sheriff’s office posted that there was no merit to the rumor. The idea that someone has financed racial justice protests echoes claims that spread online for months falsely arguing that George Soros, the billionaire investor and Democratic donor, had paid protesters. The notion that a shadowy cabal of Democratic elites like Mr. Soros pulls strings behind the scenes and controls the world with money is a main pillar of the far-right extremist conspiracy theory QAnon. QAnon is the same conspiracy theory Mr. Trump winked at by baselessly alleging that Mr. Biden is under the control of “people you haven’t heard of.” The theory states, falsely, that the world is run by a group of Satan-worshiping pedophiles that is plotting against Mr. Trump while operating a global child sex-trafficking ring. QAnon followers believe that this clique includes top Democrats like Mr. Soros, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. And they believe that real and actual political power resides not with candidates like Mr. Biden, but with these individuals exercising their secret power beyond any immediately visible public link. — Davey Alba and Ben Decker Joseph R. Biden Jr. is expected to report a record-breaking haul of donations for August, raising more than $300 million between his campaign and his shared committees with the Democratic Party, according to two people familiar with the matter. The sum would shatter past monthly records as small donors have poured money into Mr. Biden’s coffers, especially since the selection of Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, and big contributors have given checks that can be as large as $620,000. In a sign of the financial momentum behind Democrats, ActBlue, the main site that processes donations to the party, reported the second-biggest fund-raising day in its history on Monday, with more than $35 million donated. A majority of Mr. Biden’s August total came from online grass-roots donors, according to a campaign official. The people familiar with Mr. Biden’s fund-raising did not know the exact final figure for the month of August, or how much higher than $300 million it would be. The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Any amount above $300 million would surpass previous monthly hauls by candidates of both parties. It is more, for instance, than what Donald J. Trump ($90 million) and Hillary Clinton ($143 million) raised in August 2016 — combined. In July, President Trump and the Republican National Committee out-raised Mr. Biden and the Democrats, $165 million to $140 million. The Trump campaign has not announced its August fund-raising total but has said it raised $76 million over its four-day convention last week, slightly more than the $70 million the Biden campaign said it collected during its convention a week earlier. — Shane Goldmacher President Trump on Tuesday won another delay in the long-running legal battle over whether he must turn over eight years of tax returns to the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which subpoenaed them last year in a criminal investigation focused on Mr. Trump, his business and his associates. In a brief order, a federal appeals court in New York said it would temporarily block a grand jury subpoena issued by the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a Democrat, while it considers Mr. Trump’s arguments that the request was “wildly overbroad” and politically motivated. The ruling is the latest development in the president’s aggressive effort to keep his tax returns and other financial records out of the hands of prosecutors, Congress and others — a dispute that has reached the United States Supreme Court once and is almost certain to return there. With an election looming, the ruling means that, as a practical matter, prosecutors will not receive Mr. Trump’s records for at least another month, and perhaps longer if the president seeks a review in the Supreme Court. — Benjamin Weiser and William K. Rashbaum The incumbent Senator Edward J. Markey and his challenger, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, are headlining the Massachusetts primary vote on Tuesday, but their bitter head-to-head battle is not the only race on the ballot. Voters also will weigh in on a set of House primaries that have pitted some of the party’s more moderate politicians against a lineup of more progressive upstarts. In deep-blue Massachusetts — where both of the state’s senators and all nine of its representatives are Democrats — the results of Tuesday’s votes could be a bellwether for the future of the party, and serve as a test of strength for the Democratic Party’s more progressive wing in Massachusetts and elsewhere. Polls opened at 7 a.m. Eastern time and close at 8 p.m. Seven candidates are running for the seat representing the Fourth District, the one Mr. Kennedy is vacating. The progressives on the ballot — including Jesse Mermell, a front-runner who has been endorsed by Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Ihssane Leckey, who has been endorsed by Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota — might split the vote, which could present an opportunity for Jake Auchincloss, 32, a Marine veteran endorsed by The Boston Globe. In the Eighth Congressional District, which includes part of Boston, Robbie Goldstein, 36, an infectious disease specialist, has mounted a progressive challenge to the longtime incumbent Stephen Lynch, 65. And in the First Congressional District in western Massachusetts, the 16-term congressman Richard E. Neal — who, as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is one of the most powerful Democrats in the House — is facing a challenge from Alex B. Morse, the 31-year-old mayor of Holyoke. Mr. Neal, 71, has been in Congress since 1989, the year Mr. Morse was born. Mr. Morse has been endorsed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York; Mr. Neal has been endorsed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It has been a tumultuous race for Mr. Morse, who considered dropping out several weeks ago after he was accused of inappropriate advances toward students at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where he was once a guest lecturer. He opted to remain in the race after The Intercept published messages from some of the students who had lodged accusations, revealing that they had discussed how they might damage his campaign. But none of these races have drawn as much attention as the Senate contest between Mr. Markey, 74, and Mr. Kennedy, 39, who now is trailing in the polls. The two represent different generations of Democratic and state politics but are running on similar platforms, with each campaigning as the bold, progressive insurgent. — Jacey Fortin A new poll from the University of New Hampshire found that people who regularly watched Fox News or listened to conservative talk radio were significantly less likely to wear face masks than the population at large. Among New Hampshire residents who never watch Fox News, 86 percent wear a face mask every time they are in public, unless they are both outdoors and socially distanced, according to the survey. Among those who occasionally watch Fox, that number is 74 percent, and among those who watch Fox frequently, it is only 50 percent. The gap was even larger among conservative talk radio listeners. Among those who never listened, 87 percent said they wore masks; the number fell to 56 percent among occasional listeners and just 33 percent among frequent listeners. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. The same pattern held on other indicators of how seriously people were taking the coronavirus pandemic. Fox News and conservative talk radio consumers were much less likely to say that they were worried about their or their family’s health, or that the worst of the pandemic was yet to come. Eighty-one percent of respondents who never watched Fox, and 76 percent of respondents who never listened to conservative talk radio, said the government should prioritize containing the virus over restarting the economy. But only 12 percent of frequent Fox viewers and 3 percent of frequent talk radio listeners said the same. — Maggie Astor The United States Chamber of Commerce, the influential and heavily Republican-leaning pro-business lobby, plans to break with past practice and endorse 23 first-term House Democrats in the coming weeks, according to a person familiar with its plans, giving a boost to vulnerable Democratic incumbents and rankling conservatives. Among the Democrats the chamber intends to support are Representatives Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria of Virginia, Antonio Delgado of New York, Kendra Horn of Oklahoma, Abby Finkenauer of Iowa and Xochitl Torres Small of New Mexico. Each faces a difficult re-election fight this fall in a district that has traditionally voted Republican. The imprimatur of the powerful group would help burnish their claims of bipartisanship in races where Republican opponents say the Democrats are socialists in the thrall of party radicals. The chamber also voted to endorse 29 freshman House Republicans. The endorsements are likely to be rolled out publicly in the coming weeks. A spokesman declined to comment on the internal deliberations, which were first reported by The Hill. As arguably the country’s most powerful business organization, the chamber has disproportionately supported Republican candidates, pumping tens of millions of dollars into their campaigns. While the group has endorsed a smattering of Democrats in recent years, they have represented a tiny fraction of the candidates it has supported. But since President Trump took office — frequently clashing with Republican orthodoxy on trade and other economic issues — the chamber has made a concerted effort to reimagine the way it evaluates candidates to try to spur bipartisanship on Capitol Hill, on the theory that doing so would better serve businesses. Conservatives have balked at the shift, trying to derail the endorsement of the Democrats and criticizing the move once it became public. Brad Todd, a prominent Republican strategist working on congressional campaigns this fall, said in an interview that the chamber was putting at risk the most significant pro-business measure in recent memory: the corporate tax cut passed by Republicans in 2017, which Democrats opposed. “It is the most hard-fought victory for free enterprise in the last 15 years, and the chamber is an active and willing ally in giving it up,” Mr. Todd said. “By endorsing the most vulnerable members of the House Caucus, they are endorsing the continued majority of Nancy Pelosi.” — Nicholas Fandos Republicans and Democrats are waging a legal trench war over the rules for casting a ballot in November that may have decisive consequences in some states. Republicans say they want to tighten voting requirements to prevent fraud, though experts say fraud is a minuscule election problem. Democrats favor rules that make it easier to vote. Monday saw three developments in that legal war, all in states that could be competitive in the presidential election. In Texas, the Republican attorney general filed suit to stop the chief election official in heavily Democratic Harris County — Houston, to most people — from sending applications to vote by mail to two million voters. The filing said the mailing would create confusion and encourage fraud. Texas is mired in a deeply partisan battle over who should be able to cast an absentee ballot in a pandemic, with Republicans largely managing to defend restrictive state rules. Texas is one of just six states that prohibit voters worried about getting Covid-19 from casting ballots by mail instead of in person. But no law bars county officials from sending applications to voters. The attorney general nevertheless argued that the mass mailing exceeds the authority “implied” under state law. In Iowa, national Democrats sued to overturn an order by the Republican secretary of state that bars county clerks from sending voters absentee ballot applications that have been pre-completed with details like voters’ names and addresses. Paul Pate, Iowa’s secretary of state, has said that only blank applications are valid; Republicans argue that making voters fill in those missing details is an important security measure. The issue has consequences: Last week, local judges in two Iowa counties invalidated some 64,000 pre-completed ballot requests that voters had already submitted, effectively making those voters repeat the process. Thousands of additional ballot applications that had been sent out but had not been returned also would be negated. The Democratic lawsuit argues that county officials have sent similarly completed ballot applications in past years without objection. And in Georgia, a federal district judge sided with national Democrats and ordered an extension of the deadline by which absentee ballots must be received to be considered valid. Current rules invalidate any mail ballot received after the 7 p.m. closing of the polls on Election Day. The ruling extends that deadline to 7 p.m. on the third day after Election Day for any ballot that is postmarked no later than Election Day. Citing the burdens of the pandemic — and noting that the state rejected 7,821 ballots as late in the state’s June primary election — the judge said the risk that valid votes would go uncounted was considerable. — Michael Wines President Trump denied on Tuesday that he suffered any mini-strokes when he was mysteriously taken to a hospital last year and he had his doctor issue a statement supporting him, but neither gave a fuller explanation for the visit, which had not been on his schedule. “It never ends!” the president wrote on Twitter. “Now they are trying to say that your favorite President, me, went to Walter Reed Medical Center, having suffered a series of mini-strokes. Never happened to THIS candidate – FAKE NEWS. Perhaps they are referring to another candidate from another Party!” Mr. Trump did not identify who he believed was making that claim. “Donald Trump vs. the United States,” a new book published on Tuesday by Michael S. Schmidt, a New York Times reporter, said that on the day of Mr. Trump’s trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland last November, word went out for Vice President Mike Pence to be on standby to take over the powers of the presidency temporarily if Mr. Trump had to undergo a procedure that would have required him to be anesthetized. The book did not claim that Mr. Trump, 74, had mini-strokes, a detail that the president volunteered even as he sought to knock it down. He seemed to be responding not to media reports but a tweet by Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary under President Bill Clinton, who made no claim but simply asked a question based on Mr. Schmidt’s book. “Did @realDonaldTrump have a stroke which he is hiding from the American public?” Mr. Lockhart wrote. Dr. Sean Conley, the White House physician, issued a statement of his own. “I can confirm that President Trump has not experienced nor been evaluated for a cerebrovascular accident (stroke), transient ischemic attack (mini stroke), or any acute cardiovascular emergencies, as have been incorrectly reported in the media,” Dr. Conley said, mischaracterizing news reports. “The president remains healthy and I have no concerns about his ability to maintain the rigorous schedule ahead of him,” Dr. Conley added. “As stated in my last report, I expect him to remain fit to execute the duties of the presidency.” The White House has said Mr. Trump’s unannounced trip to the hospital last November was simply part of his “regular, primary preventive care,” but provided no further details. — Peter Baker More than one million mail-in ballots were delivered to voters late during the 2020 primary elections, a new report from the United States Postal Service’s inspector general found in an audit released on Tuesday, underscoring concerns about the feasibility of widespread voting by mail in November’s general election. In a survey of mail-in ballots sent during primary elections from June 2 to Aug. 13, the audit found that more than one million were mailed during the final week of the election, putting those ballots at “high risk” of not making it back to elections officials in time to be counted. The investigation comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of the Postal Service. President Trump has claimed, without evidence, that voting by mail is more vulnerable to fraud, and Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, an ally of Mr. Trump, has made operational changes that have coincided with a slowdown in mail deliveries. The situation has prompted widespread concern among Democrats and voting rights groups that the president is seeking to interfere with the mail to bolster his re-election chances or sow distrust about the result. The problems were most pronounced in Kentucky and New York, according to the report, where a combined 628,000 ballots were sent late. In 17 states, the audit found, more than 589,000 ballots were sent from election boards to voters after the state’s ballot mailing deadline. And in 11 states, more than 44,000 ballots were sent from election boards to voters on the day of, or the day before, the state’s primary election. One troubling finding, investigators noted, came from Pennsylvania, where 500 ballots were sent to voters the day after the election. For months, the Postal Service has warned states to change their deadlines to avoid sending last-minute ballots to voters. An election expert testified before Congress last week that more than 20 states had failed to do so, potentially disenfranchising thousands of voters in November’s presidential election. — Luke Broadwater President Trump heads to an unsettled Kenosha.
