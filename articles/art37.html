The pay-per-view, which carries a price tag of $49.99, began at 9 p.m. Eastern time. A free undercard began at 8 p.m. There are at least five scheduled bouts split between the main card and the undercard. The main event between Jones and Tyson could start around midnight Eastern but — honestly — who knows given the lengthy musical performances and shuffles with the fights themselves. It should be surprising to nobody that some things have changed on the fly. Tyson vs. Jones, heavyweight, eight rounds The YouTube star Jake Paul vs. the former N.B.A. player Nate Robinson, cruiserweight, six rounds Badou Jack, a former supermiddleweight and light heavyweight champion, vs. Blake McKernan, light heavyweight, eight rounds Jamaine Ortiz vs. Sulaiman Segawa, lightweight, eight rounds There are also promised musical performances by Saint Jhn, Snoop Dogg, French Montana, Wiz Khalifa and YG, with Ne-Yo performing the national anthem. Another scheduled bout, between Hasim Rahman Jr. and Rashad Coulter, was canceled because Rahman tested positive for the coronavirus. There was also a listed undercard fight between heavyweights Juiseppe Cusumano and Greg Corbin, but it’s unclear what happened to it. Explain to me again how these fights are legit. Yeah, that Badou Jack fight was pretty lopsided (for a decision). Jamaine Ortiz won in the ring and is winning on Instagram. Tyson called Diego Maradona one of his heroes. Edward Vasquez won the first fight of the night. Trump could end up a part of this and it would actually make sense. This fight is all about nostalgia, which is fitting for sports in 2020. One of the warm-up bouts was canceled after a fighter tested positive for the coronavirus. This could be quite popular. What’s that mean for boxing at large? Are these fights real? Who’s bankrolling this spectacle? By Kevin Draper The California State Athletic Commission, which regulates all fights in the state, has been down this road before. Last year, about this time, the agency sanctioned a fight between Logan Paul and KSI, two YouTube stars who had fought once before, in London. Calling them amateur fighters is both accurate and insulting to real amateur fighters who train and fight for years. But deciding whether or not to permit a bout between two YouTubers wasn’t particularly difficult. As Andy Foster, the executive officer of the commission, explained it, the basic goal is to make sure all fights are safe, allowing for the fact that the two fighters are trying to pummel each other in the face. Two physically matched, mostly unskilled YouTube stars is a safe, even match, even if it doesn’t sound particularly compelling. By that token, Mike Tyson and Roy Jones Jr., both in their 50s and former professional fighters who know exactly what they are doing are, well, professionals. Record-wise, the fight will not count; it is considered an exhibition. But every other fight will, including the one between Nate Robinson, the former N.B.A. player, and Jake Paul, the YouTube star and brother of the aforementioned Logan Paul. By Morgan Campbell Late in Round 1, 33-year-old prospect Blake McKernan landed a right hand to Badou Jack’s head, the kind of clean punch that wins the Sacramento, Calif., native respect and room to operate when he’s fighting the kind of guys that fill out his 13-0 record. But Jack isn’t a journeyman like Alfredo Contreras or Miguel Cubos. He’s a former world champ at 168 and 175 pounds, and he absorbed the shot without blinking, which made sense. That punch was McKernan’s only connection in the opening round. Jack landed 16 times. The remaining seven rounds were only marginally more competitive. Jack stalked McKernan and landed every variety of punch — jabs, right hands, lefts and rights to the body. McKernan retreated and chose his spots to counterattack, but Jack overwhelmed him. Every judge scored every round for Jack, who improved to 23-3-3, and now hopes for another title fight against Jean Pascal, who defeated him last December. McKernan left the bout with his first loss and a hematoma above his right eye. By Morgan Campbell Midway through his victory over rugged lightweight Sulaiman Segawa, 24-year-old Jamaine Ortiz boasted roughly 5,700 Instagram followers. By the time Ortiz finished off Segawa to seal a seventh-round technical knockout victory, that figure had jumped by more than 1,000. And by the time rappers French Montana and Swae Lee launched into their post-fight medley, Ortiz’ Instagram following had cracked five figures. By that metric, Ortiz, a smooth switch-hitter who improved his record to 14-0, recorded one of the biggest wins of the evening, captivating casual fans and drive-by viewers with his performance and converting them into fans of his own. Anybody wondering whether this card would feature real fights should thank the matchmakers, because Ortiz-Segawa was as competitive and fast-paced and violent and skilled as the featherweight bout preceding it. Segawa, a southpaw slugger who fights out of Silver Spring, Md., actually outlanded Ortiz 129-121, but Ortiz connected on the bout’s definitive blow — a left hook to the rib cage that dropped Segawa to a knee. He beat the count, but Ortiz unloaded a series of shots, prompting referee Ray Corona to stop the fight. By Kevin Draper Even among the surreal and larger-than-life characters that have populated the boxing world over the years, Mike Tyson stands out. Might the closest comparison be one of the greatest soccer players ever, and Tyson’s friend, the recently passed Diego Maradona? “The Hand of God, Maradona has left us,” Tyson tweeted on Wednesday. “In 86 we both won our championships. They use to compare the two of us. He was one of my hero’s and a friend. I respected him so much. He will be greatly missed.” The Hand of God, Maradona has left us.  In 86 we both won our championships.  They use to compare the two of us.  He was one of my hero’s and a friend.  I respected him so much.  He will be greatly missed. pic.twitter.com/E5j6DSfJas Tyson made an appearance on the Argentine talk show Maradona hosted in the mid-2000s, where he compared their upbringings. “The important thing is that people like us, who come from the same place we do, have always fought to get where we are,” he told Maradona. Both Tyson and Maradona were athletically gifted, both have suffered from personal demons and both spent about as many years remembered as a punchline as they were remembered for their athletic prowess. Maradona mostly harmed himself — he was addicted to cocaine and abused alcohol — but he also was accused of domestic abuse and said to have associations with organized crime. Tyson often harmed others outside of the ring, and was sentenced to prison for rape. After appearing on Maradona’s talk show in 2005, Tyson traveled to Brazil to face charges that he assaulted a cameraman. He arrived at the courthouse in Sao Paulo wearing a signed jersey Maradona gave him — a national team jersey for Argentina. By Morgan Campbell We learned some things in the opening bout between Irvin Gonzalez Jr. and Edward Vasquez: The ring for tonight’s fight card is small, which makes sense given that the combined age of the main event’s combatants is 105. Neither 54-year-old Mike Tyson nor 51-year-old Roy Jones Jr. will need or even want much room to maneuver. At their ages, the less moving the better. The tiny ring also suited the featherweights Gonzalez and Vasquez, who spent eight rounds pounding each other from close range in the evening’s opening bout. The taller Gonzalez had a reach advantage, but he didn’t use it. The shorter Vasquez accepted the opportunity to fight chest-to-chest. Both men were busy — they each threw 545 punches over eight rounds — but Vasquez, a 25-year-old from Fort Worth, Texas, landed the more convincing blows, and swayed two of the three judges to win a split decision. Vasquez improves his record to 9-0, while the 24-year-old Gonzalez falls to 14-3. By Kevin Draper Will politics make an appearance tonight? That probably depends upon whether President Trump — who attended the U.F.C. fight of a supporter last year — tunes in and tweets about it. Like many things in 2020, this fight has a surprising number of connections, and some bizarre ones, to the president. Many of Mike Tyson’s fights in the mid-1980s took place at the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, N.J., and Trump promoted the 1988 fight in which Tyson famously knocked out Michael Spinks in the first round. In 2015, Tyson endorsed Trump during the Republican primary. Endorsed, but did not vote for, because Tyson voted for the first time earlier this month. Tyson was convicted of rape in 1992 and served three years in prison, and in most states felons cannot vote. But a Nevada law passed last year restores voting rights to felons upon their release. Tyson has not said who he voted for in this election. If you are tired of hearing about Russia, well, sorry. Roy Jones Jr. became a Russian citizen five years ago, after a personal appeal to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, during a meeting over tea. Jones, who was born in Florida, has said Putin is “misunderstood” and that he is a “man’s man.” Yes, this fight has explicit Trump and Russia connections. A number of the rappers performing, or who were supposed to perform, before the fight have expressed strong feelings about Trump. Lil Wayne seemingly endorsed the president in October as part of a wave of rappers meeting with the president, enduring a wave of backlash from fans. But he won’t perform even though his appearance has been promoted for weeks. Organizers replaced him on the fight event’s website with the rapper Saint Jhn and Snoop Dogg without explanation. Snoop Dogg called Trump a “punk” over the summer and said he would vote against him. Meanwhile, French Montana has criticized Kanye West’s support of Trump, DaBaby profanely reacted to a Trump campaign solicitation for money and one of YG’s popular songs is titled “FDT” — we’ll let you Google that one on your own. The New York Times When Mike Tyson first became a heavyweight champion, Ronald Reagan was the U.S. president. When he was last in a fight that counted, George W. Bush was in office. Now it is 15 years later in the era of President Trump and Tyson is fighting once again. In many ways, this fight is pure nostalgia. The biggest documentary of the year was about the 1990s Chicago Bulls. “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” is coming back. Tyson is fighting again. In other ways, the fight is pure 2020. It’s happening mainly because videos of Tyson working out went viral online. All of that and more is contemplated in an excellent preview of the fight by the Times’s Jonathan Abrams. You can, and should, read that piece here. By Oskar Garcia The first fight on the main card, between Hasim Rahman Jr. and Rashad Coulter, was canceled because Rahman tested positive for the coronavirus. Rahman apologized to his fans on Twitter and said he had been looking forward to showcasing his talents on a big stage. “It’s devastating news that I won’t be able to compete, but my health is first and foremost,” he said. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 pic.twitter.com/Sp6R5GAajg Coulter, a former U.F.C. fighter, said he hoped to fight Rahman down the line. “I’m sorry about your positive test my friend,” Coulter said before adding that he wanted to prove Rahman wrong for his opinion that mixed martial arts have difficulty boxing. I'm sorry about your positive test my friend, BUT I'm going to hold you to these words. I will show every boxer "UFC FIGHTERS" know how to box. Lets go.. https://t.co/ve82QyO0DJ  By Morgan Campbell The promoters proclaimed recently that Tyson-Jones had broken presale records at FITE.tv, the event’s online pay-per-view partner. Without numbers or comparison points, it is impossible to know what it means to break FITE.tv’s pay-per-view presale record. But we know that Tyson, a big draw in his late-1980s heyday, remains popular as an all-purpose celebrity in 2020. Novelty bouts like this happen periodically, often attracting a large audience. And they nearly always prompt questions about what it means for the boxing industry when a farcical fight outdraws legitimate, high-level matchups, like Terence Crawford’s dominating knockout of Kell Brook on ESPN earlier this month. The answer to that question is that it means nothing. Boxing is a niche sport with a reliable TV audience of one million to 1.3 million viewers for title fights on cable. That number hasn’t budged for years. Novelty fights appeal to a broader audience by matching people who are famous for something besides boxing. Full-time fighters on the undercard might win some new fans among the drive-by viewers tuning in to watch Tyson, Jones, Paul or Robinson, and those fights won’t drain fans from Teofimo Lopez, Tyson Fury or anybody else near the top of boxing’s pound-for-pound list. By Morgan Campbell They’re all real in that they involve two people punching each other. Whether any of these bouts is in the context of serious competition and the sport at large is a different question. This card is being sanctioned by the California State Athletic Commission. Every bout besides the Tyson-Jones main event will appear on fighters’ records. And every bout — except the cofeature, between Jake Paul and Nate Robinson — involves full-time professional boxers. The biggest name not in the two featured events is Badou Jack, a former world champion at 168 and 175 pounds who has headlined cards in Las Vegas, New York and Toronto. He’ll face a 33-year-old prospect named Blake McKernan. The lightweights Jamaine Ortiz (13-0) and Sulaiman Segawa (13-2-1) will fight for a regional title, as will the featherweights Irvin Gonzalez Jr. (14-2) and Edward Vazquez (8-0). They’re the kind of fights you’d see on the undercard of a midweek show on cable — meaningful to the competitors but not big enough to cause a ripple in the broader sports world. By Morgan Campbell The website for this fight card is TysonOnTriller.com, and it is not an accident that Triller, a TikTok-style app where users post quick-hit videos, has its fingerprints all over this event. Before Triller embarked on a spending spree to bring internet-famous content creators to the platform or faced reported allegations of inflating download and user stats, it had Tyson under contract and a plan to promote and broadcast this exhibition. Will Saturday’s fights help Triller challenge TikTok as the it app for posting short, edited videos? It’s hard to tell, but the tactic isn’t new. Before Triller took on TikTok, Shots tried to go head-to-head with Instagram. Shots, you probably don’t remember, was a photo-posting app backed by Floyd Mayweather and Justin Bieber. It was similar to Instagram except that it didn’t allow comments on posts — only likes. Mayweather would use it to break news of coming fights, urging his followers on other platforms to download Shots for major announcements. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
