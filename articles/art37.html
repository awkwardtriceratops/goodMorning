I asked her why she thought a smell museum was such a vital way to document her life. “Every time you notice a smell — fresh bread, your best friend’s house, a wet dog, garlic frying in butter — it means volatile particles in the air have entered your body and, just for a moment, become a part of you,” she said.  “There is no sense more intimate, or more complex, which is why recalling your own personal smell memories can be so precise, vivid and even emotional. Your recollections might be one day, or several decades old, but that smell was once a part of you.” We asked New York Times readers what smells they would archive in their own smell museums, what scents are so alive for them that they have become part of them.
