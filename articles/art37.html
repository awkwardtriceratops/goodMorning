A suspect was in custody, accused of shooting two Louisville officers. RIGHT NOW The former Louisville police detective charged with endangering Ms. Taylor’s neighbors by shooting blindly into her apartment will plead not guilty, his lawyer said. The authorities in Louisville, Ky., have charged Larynzo Johnson, 26, with 14 counts of wanton endangerment and two counts of assault on a police officer after two officers were shot during protests in the city, according to the Louisville Metro Department of Corrections. Mr. Johnson was arrested on Wednesday, booked Thursday morning, and is scheduled to be arraigned on Friday, the department said. The city erupted in angry demonstrations Wednesday after a grand jury decided not to bring charges against the police officers who shot and killed Breonna Taylor during a botched nighttime raid on her apartment in March. The grand jury instead indicted another officer involved in the raid for recklessly firing shots that entered a neighboring apartment. That officer, Brett Hankison, a detective who has since been fired from the police force, plans to plead not guilty to the charges in the indictment, three counts of wanton endangerment in the first degree, according to his attorney, Stew Mathews. There is no date set yet for the arraignment, Mr. Mathews said, declining to comment further. The decision in a case that has drawn widespread condemnation and outrage sparked other demonstrations across the country as well. Ms. Taylor’s name has become a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement, along with those of George Floyd and other Black people across the country who have been killed by the police. Neither of the officers who were shot during the protests in Louisville sustained  life-threatening injuries, Mayor Greg Fischer said at a news conference Thursday morning. He said that one of the officers, Maj. Aubrey Gregory, a commander, had been released from the hospital after treatment for a leg wound. The other officer, Robinson Desroches, was recovering from abdomen surgery, the mayor said. TRANSCRIPT And what we saw last night, with the two police officers being shot, is obviously completely unacceptable. Violence will only be a source of pain, not a cure for pain. And we know that violence is never the answer. Our community is hurting — many see Breonna Taylor’s case as both the tragic death of a young woman and the continuation of a long pattern of devaluation and violence that Black women and men face in our country as they have historically. The question obviously is what do we do with this pain? There is no one answer, no easy answer to that question, but I do know this: Violence is not the answer, and destruction is not the answer. So I’m asking everyone to reject violence, and join me in committing ourselves to the work of reform, for justice and for equity, and do that now. We have to respond to what Dr. King called “the fierce urgency of now,” because this problem has always been — but it’s acutely even more so — urgent today. Mr. Fischer said that while he knew the community was hurting over the grand jury’s action, the shooting of the officers was “completely unacceptable.” “Many see Breonna Taylor’s case as both the tragic death of a young woman, and the continuation of a long pattern of devaluation and violence that Black women and men face in our country, as they have historically,” the mayor said. The question, he said, is: “What do we do with this pain?” He added: “When any of us gives into the temptation to channel anger into violence, we slow our progress.” There were additional reports of injuries to police officers, including a sergeant who was struck by a protester’s baton, and another who suffered a knee injury “while arresting a resisting individual,” the chief said. Another officer was spit on, he said. Chief Robert J. Schroeder of the Louisville police said there were 16 instances of looting in Louisville on Wednesday night, and that 127 people were arrested during the protests. “There were several instances of unlawful behavior where police needed to intervene,” he said. Raoul Cunningham, president of the Louisville chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., said on CNN  Thursday that he and many others were deeply discouraged, but not surprised, by the grand jury outcome. “We have seen justice unevenly administered in this city before,” he said. He urged demonstrators to remain peaceful, but noted that leaders should support everyone’s right to protest. “Those in leadership positions must discourage the violence, but not discourage the demonstration,” Mr. Cunningham said. TRANSCRIPT Crowd: “Whose streets? Our streets!” [series of shots] [sirens] “Right there, right there, officer down, right there.” “Officer down — yes, yes, OK.” [shots] [shouting] “We’ve got an officer down. “Officer down, officer down —” [shouting] [sirens] “They’re going to double back, right here down this alley.” “We’ve got one down. We’ve got one down.” [series of shots] “Oh, they shot guns — they’re shooting guns, real guns. They’re blasting at the police.” [sirens] “They shot at the police.” “Our officers were called to the area of Brook and College, in a large crowd and shots fired in the area. As they were deploying to investigate what was going on at First and Broadway, shots rang out, and two of our officers were shot. Both officers are currently undergoing treatment at University Hospital. One is alert and stable. The other officer is currently undergoing surgery and stable. We do have one suspect in custody.” The F.B.I. and the Louisville Metro Police Department are asking for the public’s help in obtaining photos and videos related to the shooting of the two officers. They posted on Twitter a link where the public could upload files and send tips. Chief Robert J. Schroeder of the Louisville police said he was grateful that the two officers who were shot survived. “Last night’s situation could have been so much worse,” he said. The shooting was captured on a video livestreamed by the Police Department, in which officers could be seen marching south down South Brook Street from East Broadway. In the video, several projectiles were launched from the area of the police line and made loud bangs as they burst in the air. Moments later, several other bangs were heard, and the officers scattered. A spokesman said the officers were shot several blocks away, near the corner of South Brook and East College Streets. “Shots fired, shots fired,” the woman recording the livestream said as she ran for cover. At least a dozen officers took cover behind a police truck, and officers began shouting “Officer down!” “Get to cover!” another yelled, as the officers retreated toward a nearby Walgreens. “We got one down!” A group of about 350 protesters split up at the sound of gunshots, many running through parking lots and nearby yards. The police shot at least one protester in the neck with a projectile. A crowd of about 100 people gathered on Thursday afternoon in Jefferson Square Park in downtown Louisville, the site of months of demonstrations over the police killing of Breonna Taylor. But as it has been on many recent afternoons, the atmosphere was more reminiscent of a casual gathering than a protest, with people handing out food, playing music and telling stories about the angry, contentious scene the night before. One protester in the square, Antwan Shively, lamented what he said was a poor showing by the people of the city after the announcement on Wednesday that no officer would be charged for Ms. Taylor’s death, only for endangering her neighbors with reckless gunfire. The crowds that marched from Jefferson Square through several neighborhoods of Louisville on Wednesday numbered about 250 to 400 people. Mr. Shively said numbers like that won’t be enough to force the accountability that he and other protesters want to see. “We need our whole city to come out,” Mr. Shively said. “We understand that people in Louisville are scared — most people have never seen this.” But, he added, “With it being small numbers, the police can arrest us easily and quickly.” Mr. Shively is one of several protesters who were arrested near Jefferson Square Park after the 9 p.m. curfew imposed by the city took effect Wednesday. By that time, just a few dozen protesters remained, making it easy for the police to round them up. The police had issued several warnings to disperse. The curfew will remain in effect Thursday night and Friday night, Chief Robert J. Schroeder of the Louisville police said, adding that the city expected to field a law enforcement presence Thursday that was “very similar” to Wednesday. “I think we can anticipate a variety of protest activities through tonight, through the weekend, and continuing on for some time,” the chief said at a morning news conference. Chanelle Helm, the lead organizer of Black Lives Matter Louisville, said in an interview that she expects as many people protesting across Louisville on Thursday as there were on Wednesday. Ms. Helm said that she was nervous for the safety of protesters, especially after seeing the significant law enforcement presence that was patrolling Louisville on Wednesday evening. “Of course we’re worried about that,” she said about aggression from police officers, adding: “Protest or not.” In downtown Louisville on Thursday, a reporter noted on social media that a heavy law enforcement vehicle was already roaming the streets. Protesters and some police officers, who spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity, said they expect much larger crowds this weekend than have gathered so far. Mr. Shively said he was prepared to be arrested again if many people in his city, who he described as “close minded,” failed to turn out for marches. “Sometimes you have to get arrested to prove your point,” he said. “I think I proved my point.” The Seattle Police Department placed a police officer on leave Thursday in response to a video that showed him rolling his bicycle over the head of a person lying in the street during demonstrations Wednesday. The department said in a statement that it had also referred that incident to the King County Sheriff’s Office for a potential criminal investigation. The video posted online shows a group of Seattle officers moving crowds down a street. While some officers rode bikes, one was jogging or walking with a bike toward the person lying in the middle of the road. Both tires of the officer’s bicycle appeared to roll over the person’s head. About 200 protesters in raincoats and ponchos marched through downtown Seattle on Wednesday night after news of the grand jury’s decision in the Breonna Taylor case. Shortly after midnight, the police declared the protest unlawful and ordered people to disperse. At least 13 people were arrested, according to the police, who said demonstrators set fires and threw objects at officers. Several officers were injured, including one who was hit in the head with a metal baseball bat, the police said. That incident was also caught on video, which showed that the officer, who was wearing a helmet, was able to run away from the scene. In Los Angeles, they gathered in front of the Hall of Justice. In Dallas, they gathered outside the Police Department headquarters. In Minnesota, they gathered at the Capitol. And in Norfolk, Va., one man held a sign that said, “There are Breonnas everywhere.” Anger over Ms. Taylor’s killing and the prosecutors’ handling of the case has spread far from Louisville, with protests on Wednesday night drawing crowds in New York, Chicago and Seattle. Some rallies, like those in Portland, Maine, and Memphis, were small but vocal. Thousands of protesters marched through the streets of New York, including a group in Brooklyn that met outside the Barclays Center and swelled to around 2,000 people as it marched across the Manhattan Bridge and shut down traffic. Huey Freeman said that she had been protesting since demonstrations began this summer, and that seeing so many people gather again felt like a resurgent movement. “It means that the people want justice even if the system doesn’t,” she said. In Portland, Ore., a person in a crowd of protesters threw a Molotov cocktail at a line of police officers, sending the officers running for safety as flames erupted on the street. Others in the crowd of several hundred lit small fires on the facade of a Portland Police Bureau building, and the authorities declared the gathering a riot. In St. Paul, Minn., Diamond Reynolds, the girlfriend of Philando Castile, who was fatally shot by a police officer in 2016, spoke at a rally outside the Capitol. “I don’t want this incident to get swept under the rug and everybody forgets about all the innocent lives that have been taken,” Ms. Reynolds said. “We can never forget about any of these lives.” The police in Denver arrested a man who they said drove a car into a protest near the State Capitol building Wednesday night. No injuries were reported. Video taken by a reporter for The Denver Post showed a crowd surrounding the vehicle before the driver accelerated through them, throwing one person to the ground. About 100 people joined the Rev. Michael Pfleger in a march on Chicago’s South Side, stopping to shut down traffic in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood for about an hour. The protesters using a gallon of fake blood to spell out “Breonna” in the middle of the intersection, and then sat in the street and chanted, “We want justice, we want it now.” The Georgia Department of Public Safety’s SWAT team used “less lethal gas” after “unruly protesters” in Atlanta ignored orders not to climb on a SWAT vehicle, said Franka Young, a department spokeswoman. One video posted on Twitter shows a SWAT team member pushing, then kicking a canister that is releasing a white gas toward protesters. In Buffalo, a pickup truck drove through a group of protesters in Niagara Square about 8:45 p.m. and struck a protester who was on a bicycle, the Police Department said. The person who was hit was taken to Erie County Medical Center with what appeared to be non-life-threatening injuries. About 50 people gathered on a Milwaukee street corner for a candlelight vigil, by turns silent and spirited, in front of a large mural of Ms. Taylor on a brick wall. “This is not going to end until we challenge the systems,” said Pilar Olvera, stressing that Black women could not fight the battle alone. Shortly after, a woman led the crowd in a call and response: “Say her name! Breonna Taylor!” Weeks after launching an offensive against Texas cities accused of defunding police departments, Gov. Greg Abbott proposed a package of six bills on Wednesday that are meant to crack down on rioters and unlawful protesters. “Texas will always defend the First Amendment right to peacefully protest,” Mr. Abbott said at a news conference in Dallas, “but Texas is not going to tolerate violence or vandalism or rioting.” Flanked by members of the Dallas Police Department and Republican lawmakers, the two-term governor outlined six pieces of legislation that would impose felony convictions and jail time for illegal behavior during riots. The proposed measures, to be introduced in the next session of the Texas Legislature in January, would be aimed at those who, during a riot, cause injury or destroy property, block hospital entrances, use fireworks or target officers with a laser. Other measures call for a jail sentence for anyone convicted of hitting or striking an officer with a projectile like a brick or bottle, or providing financial or organizational support to aid or abet a riot, including people who are not at the scene. The governor, whose current term runs another two years, has emphasized law and order as he has led Texas Republicans toward the November elections, after a summer of protests in major cities around the country that have drawn strong criticism from President Trump. Like the president, Mr. Abbott has lashed out at Democratic-leaning metropolitan areas, especially Austin, for budget cuts that the governor has said were attempts to “defund” the police. Measures he proposed last month would freeze property taxes and halt annexations in cities that significantly reduce police department budgets. Mr. Abbott said the measures he proposed on Wednesday are intended to “do even more” to protect law enforcement officers while upholding the right to demonstrate peacefully. “Peaceably is the word used in the Constitution,” he declared. “The Constitution does not provide the right to rob, to loot, to set fires, to physically harm anyone or anything.” Manny Garcia, the executive director of the state Democratic Party, called the governor’s announcement a “pathetic and weak attempt to sway the conversation away from his and Trump’s failed coronavirus response and their failures to keep Texans safe.” Professional athletes across the country took to social media to vent their frustrations over the grand jury’s decision, again highlighting their role in focusing public attention on race and policing. “The white supremacist institution of policing that stole Breonna Taylor’s life from us must be abolished for the safety and well being of our people,” Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, posted on Twitter. Mr. Kaepernick became a political lightning rod and lost his job in the N.F.L. after taking a knee during the national anthem in 2016. Ms. Taylor’s death was among the few high-profile police shootings in which a woman was killed since the start of the Black Lives Matter movement, and female athletes have been instrumental in directing attention to the investigation. The W.N.B.A. dedicated its season to Ms. Taylor. Players wore her name on their jerseys, held moments of silence and supported the #SayHerName campaign meant to keep her case in the public eye. “We time and time again hope for a sliver of justice but why would we get that when the system is designed to protect the very folks that are murdering and terrorizing us,” Layshia Clarendon of the New York Liberty, who is a member of the W.N.B.A.’s Social Justice Council, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “This isn’t a bad apple, it’s a rotten tree.” “My heart is with the family of Breonna Taylor right now,” wrote Megan Rapinoe, captain of the U.S. women’s national soccer team. “My god. This is devastating and unfortunately not surprising. Black and brown folx in this country deserve so much more.” Members of the N.B.A., who are often ahead of the curve in calling for social justice, were especially vocal about their disappointment in the grand jury’s decision. There were no on-court displays for Ms. Taylor in a game between the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat after Wednesday’s announcement, but N.B.A. players spoke out elsewhere, as did the head of their union. “Sadly, there was no justice today for Breonna Taylor,” Michele Roberts, the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association, wrote in a statement, saying that Ms. Taylor’s death was the result of “callous and careless decisions made with a lack of regard for humanity.” “Our players and I once again extend our deepest sympathies to her family and we vow to continue working in her honor and to always say her name,” she added. On Instagram, LeBron James simply said, “So so sorry!!!!” TRANSCRIPT “On or about March 13, 2020, in Jefferson County, Ky., the above-named defendant, Brett Hankison, committed the offense of wanton endangerment in the first degree. That concludes the business of the grand jury sitting for Jefferson County in September 2020. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, you may be excused.” “That’s it?” “Is that the only charge?” “The cannot do their jobs! This is why we are angry! This is why we are upset!” “Say her name!” “Breonna Taylor!” “What do we want?” “Justice!” “If we don’t get it.” “Shut it down!” “If we don‘t get it!” “Burn it down!” “If we don‘t get it!” “Burn it down!” “Coming through. Coming through.” “Move. Move.” A grand jury indicted a former Louisville police detective on Wednesday for endangering Breonna Taylor’s neighbors with reckless gunfire during a raid on her apartment in March, but the two officers who shot Ms. Taylor were not charged in her death. The decision came after more than 100 days of protests and a monthslong investigation into the death of Ms. Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician who was shot six times in the hallway of her apartment by officers executing a search warrant. Grand jurors indicted the detective,  Brett Hankison, who was fired in June,  on three counts of wanton endangerment, saying he had threatened the lives of three people who lived next to Ms. Taylor by firing bullets blindly into her apartment that landed in theirs. In a news conference following the announcement of the grand jury’s decision, Kentucky’s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, said he knew that some people would not be satisfied. “The decision before my office is not to decide if the loss of Breonna Taylor’s life was a tragedy — the answer to that question is unequivocally yes,” Mr. Cameron said. He later added: “If we simply act on outrage, there is no justice — mob justice is not justice. Justice sought by violence is not justice. It just becomes revenge.” Tamika Palmer, Ms. Taylor’s mother, drove to Frankfort, Ky., on Wednesday afternoon to be briefed on the charges by the attorney general, said her lawyer, Sam Aguiar. Advocates for the family had requested that she be briefed at least two hours before the public announcement, but they said Mr. Cameron told her the news 13 minutes before a planned news conference. She wept, said Mr. Aguiar, who was also present. Because the officers did not shoot first — it was the young woman’s boyfriend who opened fire, striking one officer in the leg; he has said he mistook the police for intruders — many legal experts had thought it unlikely the officers would be indicted in her death. Three officers fired a total of 32 shots, Mr. Cameron said. Rounds fired by Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove struck Ms. Taylor, he said, while Mr. Hankison fired 10 rounds, none of which struck Ms. Taylor. Mr. Hankison fired into the sliding glass patio door and window of Ms. Taylor’s apartment building, both of which were covered with blinds, in violation of a department policy that requires officers to have a line of sight. Some of the bullets entered a nearby apartment where a pregnant woman, her husband and their 5-year-old child were asleep. Mr. Hankison was dismissed from the force, with a termination letter stating that he showed “an extreme indifference to the value of human life.” Ms. Taylor’s name and image have become part of the national movement over racial injustice since May, with celebrities writing open letters and erecting billboards that demanded the white officers be criminally charged. Ms. Palmer sued the city of Louisville for wrongful death and received a $12 million settlement last week. But she and her lawyers insisted that nothing short of murder charges would be enough, a demand taken up by protesters nationwide. Ben Crump, a lawyer for the family, wrote on Twitter that the failure to charge any officer for killing Ms. Taylor was “outrageous and offensive.” Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Mayor Greg Fischer of Louisville, both Democrats, called on the attorney general, a Republican, to publish as much of the evidence as possible online so that the public could review it. Many legal experts said before the charges were announced that indictments for killing Ms. Taylor would be unlikely, given the state’s statute allowing citizens to use lethal force in self-defense. John W. Stewart, a former assistant attorney general in Kentucky, said he believed that at least Sergeant Mattingly and Detective Cosgrove were protected by that law. “As an African-American, as someone who has been victim of police misconduct myself, getting pulled over and profiled, I know how people feel,” Mr. Stewart said. “I have been there, but I have also been a prosecutor, and emotions cannot play a part here.”  Reporting was contributed by Mike Baker, Gillian R.
