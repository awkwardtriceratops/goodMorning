RIGHT NOW Retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee joined the growing ranks of Republicans in support of considering a nominee of President Trump. TRANSCRIPT The voters of this country should be heard. As I said, voting’s already begun. By the time we get to the middle of October, there will be millions and millions and millions who have already voted. In just a few weeks, all votes in this nation will be heard. They’re the ones who the Constitution envisioned should decide who has the power to make this appointment. And even if President Trump wants to put forward a name now, the Senate should not act until after the American people select their next president, their next Congress, their next Senate. If Donald Trump wins the election, then the Senate should move on his selection and weigh the nominee he chooses fairly. But if I win this election, President Trump’s nominee should be withdrawn. And as the new president, I should be the one to nominate Justice Ginsburg’s successor. We’re in the middle of a pandemic. Like I said, as I speak, we’re probably passing 200,000 deaths lost to this virus. Tens of millions of Americans are unemployed, health care in this country hangs in the balance before the court. And now, in a raw political move this president and the Republican leader have decided to jam a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court through the United States Senate. That’s the last thing we need at this moment. So I appeal to those few Senate Republicans, the handful who really will decide what happens, please follow your conscience. Don’t vote to confirm anyone nominated under the circumstances President Trump and Senator McConnell have created. Don’t go there. Joe Biden on Sunday urged Republicans not to “jam” a Supreme Court nominee through the Senate before the presidential election, suggesting that such a move would amount to an “abuse of power,” in his first extensive remarks on the battle to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In a speech delivered at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Mr. Biden, a former vice president and the current Democratic presidential nominee, appealed directly to the “handful” of pivotal Senate Republicans “who really will decide what happens” to “follow your conscience,” wading head-on into a matter that many political observers believe has the power to define the final weeks of the presidential race. “If Donald Trump wins the election, then the Senate should move on his selection, and weigh the nominee he chooses fairly,” he said. “But if I win this election, President Trump’s nominee should be withdrawn. And as a new president, I should be the one who nominates Justice Ginsburg’s successor, a nominee who should get a fair hearing in the Senate.” President Trump has vowed to nominate a woman for the position next week, seizing on an issue that has the potential to electrify the bases of both political parties and to inject a new measure of uncertainty into the presidential race. The election is little more than six weeks away. Justice Ginsburg was “a righteous soul,” Mr. Biden said. “She was proof that courage and conviction and moral clarity can change not only our law, can change our culture, can change the world.” His remarks come as he and other Democrats seek to frame the Supreme Court vacancy battle as one defined, above all else, by the issue of health care amid a global pandemic. They are casting their arguments in particular around protecting the Affordable Care Act, which Justice Ginsburg had voted to uphold, and its guarantee of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments a week after Election Day in a case that could determine the future of the health law. Even before Justice Ginsburg’s death, Mr. Biden and other Democratic candidates had been emphasizing health care, hoping for a repeat of the success that Democratic House candidates found in the 2018 midterm elections when the party won control of the chamber. For months, Mr. Biden had sought to make the election a referendum on Mr. Trump’s management of the pandemic and its economic fallout. Over the weekend, Democrats began to link that message to the courts, arguing that the coronavirus crisis makes the issue of health care protections all the more urgent. A second Republican senator came out against taking up a Supreme Court nomination before the election, potentially complicating Republican efforts to let President Trump swiftly fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said in a statement on Sunday that she would not support confirming a Supreme Court nominee before Election Day. Having objected to filling the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016, she said she believed “the same standard must apply” less than two months before the presidential election. “For weeks, I have stated that I would not support taking up a potential Supreme Court vacancy this close to the election,” Ms. Murkowski said in a statement. “Sadly, what was then a hypothetical is now our reality, but my position has not changed.” “I did not support taking up a nomination eight months before the 2016 election to fill the vacancy created by the passing of Justice Scalia,” she said in the statement. “We are now even closer to the 2020 election — less than two months out — and I believe the same standard must apply.” Ms. Murkowski’s remarks did not address how she felt about a vote on a justice in the weeks after the November election, when Congress will be in a so-called lame duck session and still able to vote on both legislation and nominations. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, on Saturday said not only that the Senate should not vote on a nominee before the election, but that the victor in the presidential election on Nov. 3 should fill the vacancy. But another moderate senator, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a retiring Republican considered by many to be a strong defender of Senate traditions, on Sunday joined the growing ranks of Republicans in support of confirming Mr. Trump’s pick. “No one should be surprised that a Republican Senate majority would vote on a Republican president’s Supreme Court nomination, even during a presidential election year,” Mr. Alexander said in a statement. “The Constitution gives senators the power to do it. The voters who elected them expect it.” Ms. Murkowski’s stance against a vote ahead of the November election was striking, particularly given signals from the White House that the administration hopes to nominate someone for the position in the coming days. Ms. Murkowski took care to hold to her position from 2016, but several other Republicans who resisted confirming Merrick B. Garland, President Obama’s choice for the Scalia vacancy, are now arguing that the Senate should vote to confirm President Trump’s nominee. Several sought Sunday to deflect charges of hypocrisy. “What we’re proposing is completely consistent, completely consistent with the precedent,” Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming and a member of the Senate leadership, claimed speaking on “Meet the Press.” Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas and one of the names on Mr. Trump’s short list for the open seat, said on Fox News Sunday that “the Senate majority is performing our constitutional duty and fulfilling the mandate that voters gave us in 2016 and 2018.” It remains unclear, however, whether Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, will hold a vote on a Supreme Court nominee before November, though on Friday he vowed that the Senate would vote on Mr. Trump’s nominee. With Ms. Murkowski and Ms. Collins both publicly voicing their objections to such a timeline, Mr. McConnell can only afford to lose the support of two more Republican senators. And Mr. McConnell, who is up for re-election, is cognizant of the tough races a number of his members are facing and how such a political fight could further galvanize voters. He had gone so far as to encourage his members to “keep their powder dry” when asked about a vacancy. There were continuing signs that the looming confirmation fight was motivating Democratic donors: ActBlue, the donation-processing site, announced Sunday that small-dollar donors had contributed $100 million since Friday night. Ms. Collins is embroiled in the toughest race of her political career, but Ms. Murkowski is not up for re-election until 2022. She has shown few qualms about breaking with her party in the past, even if it means incurring the wrath of the president. On Sunday morning, Mr. Trump again focused on her, derisively tweeting “No thanks!” after the Alaska Chamber invited people to join an upcoming forum featuring Ms. Murkowski. TRANSCRIPT “I will be putting forth a nominee next week. It will be a woman. [cheers] It will be a woman. Both the White House and the Senate majority have a moral duty to fulfill the promises they made to the voters. And that is exactly what we’re going to do. We said that if, for any reason, we have a vacancy on the United States Supreme Court, we will fill that vacancy. We’re not going to say — and by the way, we have plenty of time. There’s a lot of time. You know, you’re talking about — you’re talking about Jan. 20, right?” [audience chanting] “Fill that seat!” President Trump has vowed to fill the vacant Supreme Court created by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg “without delay,” and said that he would choose a woman. But Justice Ginsburg had said that her “most fervent wish” was that she not be replaced before a new president took office. “I will be putting forth the nominee next week; it will be a woman,” Mr. Trump told supporters at an outdoor rally on Saturday, at an airport in Fayetteville, N.C. “I actually like women much more than I like men.” Mr. Trump’s push to move quickly has already received pledges of support from Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who directly contradicted remarks he made in 2016 when he said he would oppose any effort to fill a Supreme Court vacancy during a presidential election year. Democrats have few tools at their disposal to block a simple majority vote on a Supreme Court nomination given the Republican control of the Senate, but Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, indicated that they would instead look to retaliate with further institutional changes if Senate control flipped in the November elections. Mr. Trump has yet to name his choice, but he identified two women as candidates in a telephone conversation on Friday night with Mr. McConnell, according to two people familiar with the call. Judges Amy Coney Barrett of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago and Barbara Lagoa of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta were the women Mr. Trump mentioned. Here is what we know about them. Judge Amy Coney Barrett Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a self-described “faithful Catholic” and a former clerk for the conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, joined the appellate court for the Seventh Circuit in 2017 after being nominated by President Trump. “She’s very highly respected. I can say that,” Mr. Trump said on Saturday. She was confirmed by the Senate along largely partisan lines, after she was grilled at her nomination hearing by Democrats on how her religious beliefs might influence her judicial thinking. The moment made her something of a hero to religious conservatives, and Ms. Barrett told the senators that her religious beliefs would not affect her decisions as an appellate judge. In that hearing, she would “have no interest in” challenging the Supreme Court precedent in Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion. But in a 2016 panel discussion, Judge Barrett, who is a favorite of anti-abortion conservatives, said she could envision the scope of abortion rights changing. A native of New Orleans, Judge Barrett, 48, graduated magna cum laude from Rhodes College in Memphis with a degree in English literature, and was selected by the faculty as the most outstanding graduate in the college’s English department. She collected a string of accolades at Notre Dame Law School, where she served as executive editor of the Notre Dame Law Review before graduating in 1997. After her law school graduation, she clerked for Judge Laurence H. Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and for Justice Scalia. In 2002, she joined the Notre Dame faculty as a professor of law. When Justice Scalia died, Judge Barrett said that “all jobs have been downhill” since her time clerking for him. She admired Justice Scalia’s friendship with Justice Ginsburg, formed in spite of their philosophical and political differences, adding, “he had great respect for those whose principles were different from his own.” She shares the originalist views of Justice Scalia, contending that judges should conserve the meaning of the Constitution as it was written. She wrote in a 2013 Texas Law Review article that a justice’s duty is to “enforce her best understanding of the Constitution rather than a precedent she thinks is clearly in conflict with it.” Judge Barbara Lagoa Judge Barbara Lagoa, a Cuban-American, was the first Hispanic woman to serve on the Florida Supreme Court and left on her appointment to the federal appellate court in 2019, after being nominated by President Trump. Judge Lagoa is from Hialeah, Fla., and attended Florida International University, where she majored in English and graduated cum laude. She then went to law school at Columbia University and became an associate editor of Columbia Law Review. Judge Lagoa, 52, practiced both civil and criminal law before joining the bench and worked on commercial litigation, including employment discrimination, at law firms in Miami including Greenberg Traurig. She was also a member of the Florida Association for Women Lawyers. She became a federal prosecutor in 2003, joining the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida, where she worked in the civil, major crimes and appellate sections. She began her judicial career in 2006, when Gov. Jeb Bush appointed her to Florida’s Court of Appeals for the Third District. She heard more than 11,000 cases and issued more than 470 written opinions, before she was picked by Gov. Ron DeSantis to join the state’s Supreme Court, where she served for 11 months. “She has been the essence of what a judge should be” Mr. DeSantis said in 2019 when he chose Judge Lagoa for the state’s high court. “She understands the rule of law, how important that is to a society.” Earlier this month, she joined a majority opinion ruling that people with felony criminal records in Florida were ineligible to vote unless they had paid all their outstanding court fines and fees. Critics say the decision disenfranchised hundreds of thousands of people. “I want you to use my words against me,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said bluntly in 2016. “If there’s a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said let’s let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination.” His scenario came true: A Republican did win the 2016 presidential election, and a vacancy did just occur in the last year of his first term. But Mr. Graham, who oversees the Senate Judiciary Committee and would preside over any confirmation hearing, now says he sees no reason to wait for the next president. And that has led others — including the challenger for Mr. Graham’s Senate seat and the Lincoln Project, a super PAC supported by Republicans critical of Mr. Trump — to take Mr. Graham up on his call to use his words against him. The Lincoln Project shared a new ad on Twitter, adding: “Lindsey said he wants us to use his words against him. Ok, done.” The ad includes video of Mr. Graham making his statements. Mr. Graham, a loyal Trump ally who is locked in a tight race against Jaime Harrison in South Carolina, cited the Democrats’ decision to eliminate the 60-vote threshold for most judicial nominees as a reason he had changed his position — though they made that change in 2013, long before he spoke out against a president filling a vacancy in the last year of a term. He also argued that “Chuck Schumer and his friends in the liberal media conspired to destroy the life of Brett Kavanaugh and hold that Supreme Court seat open.” It was a stark departure from his previous assertions, which began in 2016 and continued into 2018, even after most of the hearings to confirm Justice Kavanaugh to the nation’s highest court had taken place. In 2018, days before Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate and sworn in, Mr. Graham said again, “If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term and the primary process has started, we will wait to the next election.” His opponent, Mr. Harrison, wrote on Twitter on Saturday that Mr. Graham had proved his “word is worthless.” “When people show you who they are, believe them,” he said. “Lindsey Graham has shown us that he’s running for political power.” Former President Bill Clinton appeared to suggest on Sunday that Senate Democrats should refuse to participate in the confirmation hearings for the person President Trump is expected to nominate to the Supreme Court to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In an interview on “Face the Nation” on CBS, Mr. Clinton stressed the enormous power that a conservative justice replacing a liberal one would have to reshape the law on a wide array of policies, including health insurance coverage and voting rights. With barely six weeks until the presidential election, he said, voters need to understand the potential consequences. “I think that maybe the Democrats should leave,” Mr. Clinton said. “There are no rules on this. There’s no law. So we’ll just have to see what happens.” He did not elaborate on what he meant when he suggested that Democrats might “leave.” Most Senate Republicans on Sunday defended their plans to seat a nominee chosen by President Trump in a presidential election year, while their Democratic counterparts called for a delay. “No one should be surprised that a Republican Senate majority would vote on a Republican president’s Supreme Court nomination, even during a presidential election year. The Constitution gives senators the power to do it. The voters who elected them expect it,” Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said in a statement. “For weeks, I have stated that I would not support taking up a potential Supreme Court vacancy this close to the election. Sadly, what was then a hypothetical is now our reality, but my position has not changed,” Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said in a statement. “I believe the right thing to do is for the Senate to take up this nomination and to confirm the nominee before Election Day,” Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said on “This Week” on ABC. “What we’re proposing is completely consistent, completely consistent with the precedent,” Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming and a member of Senate leadership, said on “Meet the Press.” “The Senate majority is performing our constitutional duty and fulfilling the mandate that voters gave us in 2016 and 2018,” Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas and one of the names on Mr. Trump’s short list for the open seat, said on “Fox News Sunday.” “They set this precedent. They can’t mess around.” Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “For the Republican majority to push through a new justice in a partisan confirmation process will further divide our country, will further challenge the legitimacy of the court, and I think would dishonor Justice Ginsburg’s legacy,” Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said on “Fox News Sunday.” As much as the nickname “The Notorious R.B.G.” came to symbolize Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s status as a pop culture hero in her later years, the collars she wore with her judicial robes served as both semiology and semaphore. Vanessa Friedman, the chief fashion critic of The New York Times, writes: They signaled her positions before she even opened her mouth, and they represented her unique role as the second woman on the country’s highest court. Shining like a beacon amid the dark sea of denaturing judicial robes, Justice Ginsburg’s collars were unmistakable in photographs and from the court floor. Though obviously Justice Ginsburg’s legacy of jurisprudence is her most important gift to history, her understanding of her own significance as a role model was undeniable. As the rare female law student (and student in the rarefied air at the top of the class) — not to mention the rare female lawyer — she was used to being the only one. She knew that every statement she made, every gesture, every image, would be noted, picked over and parsed. All her choices mattered. So she might as well imbue them with meaning.
