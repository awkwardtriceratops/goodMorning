Keep the shopping and cooking simple so you can enjoy the day. By Margaux Laskey You don’t have to plan and cook for days to have a memorable Thanksgiving meal. These simple recipes call for just five ingredients or fewer (not including salt and pepper), so you can get dinner on the table and get to the best part: eating. A scattering of pomegranate seeds makes this brussels sprouts dish from Colu Henry look fancy. But it’s really just a matter of roasting the sprouts with a little olive oil, salt and pepper, then tossing with chopped walnuts and the ruby seeds. Recipe: Brussels Sprouts With Walnuts and Pomegranate Samin Nosrat’s buttermilk-brined roast chicken has long been one of NYT Cooking’s most popular recipes. It stands to reason then that the same technique applied to a whole turkey and turkey breast would yield extraordinary results. Recipes: Buttermilk-Brined Roast Turkey Breast and Buttermilk-Brined Roast Turkey The key to Mark Bittman’s potatoes au gratin is to season as you go so that each slice of potato has flavor. (Potatoes suck up a lot of salt.) If you’re looking to up your game, add fresh thyme or chopped rosemary to the half-and-half before pouring it over the potatoes. Recipe: Potatoes au Gratin Instead of taking up valuable stovetop real estate, let your slow cooker do the work. This complex cranberry sauce from Sarah DiGregorio uses a combination of cooked cranberries and crisp, fresh cranberries. Leave out the port if it’s not your thing, and don’t worry if you don’t have a slow cooker; there’s a stovetop method, too. Recipe: Slow Cooker Cranberry Sauce With Port and Orange This glossy four-ingredient dish, which Melissa Clark adapted from “The Harvey House Cookbook,” calls for just sweet potatoes, butter, confectioners’ sugar and salt. It’s best served warm, not blazing hot, so it’s ideal for Thanksgiving, when sides have to wait around patiently for the turkey to finish. Recipe: Candied Sweet Potatoes OK, so it’s not traditional pumpkin pie, but this cold and tangy dessert by Joyce LaFray Young will cheer up your taste buds after all of that rich Thanksgiving fare. Recipe: Key Lime Pie Lidey Heuck adds lemon zest and crisped pancetta to roasted green beans for a simple, yet special side dish. This recipe serves 8 to 10, but it easily halves for a smaller group. Recipe: Roasted Green Beans With Pancetta and Lemon Zest Save yourself the stress of making gravy under the watchful eyes of hungry diners by making it in advance. Mark Bittman’s version is one of our most popular Thanksgiving recipes because you can make it up to five days early. When you’re ready to eat, reheat and stir in some turkey drippings. Recipe: Make-Ahead Gravy This sunshine-y side from Amanda Hesser can be made with fresh or frozen corn. If using frozen, add a little water when cooking before you add the milk. If you want it creamier, whiz some of the cooked corn in a blender and stir it back into the pot. Recipe: Creamed Corn End the meal with something special and luxurious like this crème brûlée from Mark Bittman.  You don’t need a blowtorch; your oven’s broiler will do. One important note: Chill the custard for several hours before browning the top, otherwise you’ll end up with custard soup. Recipe: Vanilla Crème Brûlée Don’t bother peeling the butternut squash. Ali Slagle cuts it in half-inch slices before roasting, then finishes it with a tangy, spicy brown-butter vinaigrette and fresh mint. Recipe: Roasted Butternut Squash With Brown Butter Vinaigrette Here’s a fun magic trick of a dessert that Melissa Clark adapted from the molecular gastronomist Hervé This: Melt good bittersweet chocolate, place it in an ice bath, then whip it by hand for 3 to 5 minutes (you’ll want help) until thick and fluffy. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt. We have a full guide on buying and cooking Thanksgiving turkey, but here are answers to some of your most common questions: Recipe: Bittersweet Chocolate Mousse With Fleur de Sel Martha Rose Shulman’s crisp cranberry relish, which is made by whizzing fresh cranberries, a whole orange, pecans and honey in a food processor, is a refreshing break from mushy, brown Thanksgiving foods. Save leftovers to top leftover turkey sandwiches or swirl into plain yogurt. Recipe: Cranberry-Orange Relish It’s not often that carrots get a starring role on the dinner table, but when they’re roasted with olive oil, thyme and oregano like Martha Rose Shulman does it, they’ll steal the spotlight. Use rainbow carrots if you can find them. Recipe: Roasted Carrots After making these easy, buttery and flaky drop biscuits from Samantha Seneviratne, you’ll never go back to the roll-and-cut version. Try stirring in some cracked black pepper, Parmesan or finely chopped tender herbs. Recipe: Drop Biscuits This classic from Pierre Franey calls for a full two and a half pounds of fresh spinach, and it has 835 five-star ratings. You can’t go wrong. Recipe: Creamed Spinach These make-ahead butterscotch puddings from Melissa Clark are a creamy, less-fuss alternative to pie. Top them with fresh berries, if you can find them, or for a more traditional Thanksgiving take, a spoonful of apple pie filling. Add a dollop of whipped cream, of course. Recipe: No-Bake Butterscotch Custards An Instant Pot will make quick work of mashed potatoes. (We’re talking 10 minutes from start to finish.) In this recipe, Melissa Clark adds fresh chives and Parmesan. For a stovetop version, go with Julia Moskin’s mashed potato recipe. It’s always perfect. Recipe: Instant Pot Mashed Potatoes With Sour Cream and Chives Thanksgiving will be different this year. Here are hundreds of our best Thanksgiving recipes from NYT Cooking to help.
