Biden and Trump use stark terms to describe the choice between them. The postmaster says he’s ‘highly confident’ ballots mailed close to Election Day will be delivered. Four moments that defined the final night of the D.N.C. Who spoke the most at the D.N.C. and what it tells us about the party. Our critic reviews a remote D.N.C. made purely for TV. The R.N.C. chairwoman tells us what to expect at the Republican convention. A day after former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. accepted the Democratic presidential nomination with an emotional speech in which he pledged to restore American norms and “overcome this season of darkness in America,” President Trump countered Friday that the Democratic convention had been the “darkest and angriest and gloomiest” in history. The back-and-forth over darkness and light was a vivid illustration of the near-Manichean terms in which the two parties have cast this year’s election. Democrats, led by former President Barack Obama, warned urgently at their convention that the future of American democracy was at stake, while Mr. Trump spent the week painting an apocalyptic image of what will happen if he loses. “I’m the only thing standing between the American dream and total anarchy, madness and chaos, and that’s what it is,” Mr. Trump told a conservative group, the Council for National Policy, on Friday. He said he represented “the bright future, not the dark future that you saw last night and for the last four days.” Mr. Biden made a case for his vision of a post-Trump America in his convention speech on Thursday night, the most important in his career. “Here and now I give you my word: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst.” Mr. Biden said. “I will be an ally of the light, not the darkness. It’s time for us, for we the people, to come together. And make no mistake: United, we can and will overcome this season of darkness in America.” He never mentioned Mr. Trump’s name. But the former vice president quickly made an appeal to voters who aren’t predisposed to support him, saying that he would try to win them over as president. He condemned bigotry. He yoked the Trump administration’s failures in its coronavirus response to the economic crisis and the financial fragility that millions of people are facing, months into the pandemic, with no end in sight. Now, with the Democrats wrapping up a convention that was forced to go remote by the coronavirus pandemic, in which speaker after speaker made the case that Mr. Biden could heal the nation after the Trump era, Republicans are preparing to make their own case for giving Mr. Trump four more years when they gather at their own convention next week. — Michael Cooper, Michael D. Shear and Maggie Haberman TRANSCRIPT “Mr. DeJoy, your decisions have cost Americans their health, their time, their livelihoods and their peace of mind. I believe you owe them an apology for the harm you have caused, and you owe all of us some very clear answers today.” “The Postal Regulatory Commission began a mandated review of our pricing system four years ago. It has been three years since the commission concluded that our current system is not working. We urgently require the P.R.C. to do its job and establish a more rational regulatory system for our mail products. Had the Congress and P.R.C. fulfilled their obligations to the American public concerning the Postal Service, I am certain that much of our $80 billion in cumulative losses since 2007 could have been avoided, and that our operational and financial performance would not now be in such jeopardy. As we head into the election season, I want to assure this committee and the American public that the Postal Service is fully capable and committed to delivering the nation’s election mail securely and on time. First, I’d like to emphasize that there has been no changes in any policies with regard to election mail for the 2020 election. Since my arrival, we removed 700 post — collection boxes, of which I had no idea that that was a process or, that that was a process. When we found out — when I found out about it, we socialized here amongst the leadership team and looked at what, you know, what the excitement was, it was creating. So I decided to stop it.” Louis DeJoy, the embattled postmaster general, defended his first two months overseeing the Postal Service to a Senate committee on Friday and said he was “extremely highly confident” that even mail-in ballots sent close to Election Day would be delivered on time. “We will scour every plant each night leading up to Election Day,” Mr. DeJoy said as he testified for over two hours before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Mr. DeJoy, whose cost-cutting and operational changes have prompted widespread concern about mail-in voting, called suggestions that he might intentionally slow ballot delivery to help President Trump “outrageous.” “There has been no changes to any policies with regard to election mail,” Mr. DeJoy told the lawmakers, adding, “The Postal Service is fully capable and committed to delivering the nation’s election mail fully and on time.” Under questioning from Democrats, however, he refused to unwind other steps, like removing hundreds of blue mailboxes and mail sorting machines, that he said were initiated by his predecessors in response to a steady decline in mail volume. He denied knowing about the machine removal when it first began, telling senators it was “not a critical issue within the Postal Service.” Mr. DeJoy, a major donor to the Trump campaign who took office in May, is at the center of a firestorm as recent cost-cutting measures at the Postal Service — including reducing overtime and removal of mail-sorting machines — have led to delivery delays and fueled concerns that the post office might not be able to handle a crush of mail-in ballots for the 2020 election in the midst of a pandemic. Mr. Trump has stoked those concerns by repeatedly questioning the legitimacy of mail-in voting, which he baselessly claims is riddled with fraud. “The honorable thing to do is drop the Mail-In Scam before it is too late!” he wrote on Twitter last week. Even as Mr. DeJoy testified on Friday, six state attorneys general sued him and the Postal Service in federal court, arguing that changes at the service were an attempt to disenfranchise voters. Though Mr. DeJoy said earlier this week he would suspend some changes until after the election, Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania attorney general, said in a statement announcing the suit that Mr. DeJoy had not addressed some of the suit’s core concerns. He called for “detailed information” on how the agency would reverse what he said were “illegal changes.”      — Emily Cochrane, Nicholas Fandos and Matt Stevens TRANSCRIPT “Welcome to the fourth night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention: ‘Uniting America.’ OK, these last few nights have been going so well, we’ve decided to add a fifth night where we will just play Michelle Obama’s speech on a loop.” “We’ve cried out for justice. We have gathered in our streets to demand change. And now we must pass on the gift John Lewis sacrificed to give us: We must register and we must vote.” “Our military spouses hold their families together, praying for their loved ones’ safety wherever they’re deployed and serving as caregivers to our disabled servicemembers, and then picking up the pieces and starting again, whenever the next tour or the next war arises. Joe Biden understands these sacrifices because he’s made them himself. When his son Beau deployed to Iraq, his burden was also shouldered by his family. Joe knows the fear military families live because he’s felt that dread of never knowing if your deployed loved one is safe.” “A couple of years ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. And I was absolutely terrified. One of the first people who called me was Joe. His real warmth and kindness on that call — man, I gotta say, it made me cry.” “I am very excited to present to you a group of people that ran in the 2020 Democratic primary against Joe Biden. You could think of this sort of like ‘Survivor’ on the out-interviews of all the people that got voted off the island.” [laughing] “Bernie — Bernie, don’t you laugh, because I’ve got questions for you like, Why does my girlfriend like you more than she likes me? But let’s —” “Because she’s smarter than you, and that’s the obvious answer, right?” [laughing] “Hi, my name is Brayden Harrington and I am 13 years old. And without Joe Biden, I wouldn’t be talking to you today. About a few months ago, I met him in New Hampshire. He told me that we were members of the same club. We stutter. It was really amazing to hear that someone like me became vice president. I’m just a regular kid. And in this short amount of time, Joe Biden made me more confident about something that’s bothered me my whole life.” “If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. I’ll be an ally of the light, not the darkness. It’s time for us, for We the People, to come together. And make no mistake: United we can and will overcome this season of darkness in America. We’ll choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness over privilege. So it’s with great honor and humility I accept this nomination for president of the United States of America. As president, the first step I will take will be to get control of the virus that has ruined so many lives. Because I understand something this president hasn’t from the beginning: We will never get our economy back on track, we will never get our kids safely back in schools, we’ll never have our lives back, until we deal with this virus. While he’s no longer with us, Beau inspires me every day. Beau served our nation in uniform, a year in Iraq, a decorated Iraqi War veteran. So I take very personally the profound responsibility of serving as commander in chief. I’ll be a president who will stand with our allies and friends and make it clear to our adversaries: The days of cozying up to dictators is over. Just a week ago yesterday was the third anniversary of the events in Charlottesville. Close your eyes — remember what you saw on television. Remember seeing those neo-Nazis and Klansmen and white supremacists coming out of fields with lighted torches, veins bulging, spewing the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the ’30s. Remember the violent clash that ensued between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it. And remember what the president said when asked? He said there were, quote, ‘very fine people on both sides.’ It was a wake-up call for us as a country, and for me a call to action. At that moment, I knew I’d have to run, because my father taught us that silence was complicity and I could never remain silent or complicit. May history be able to say that the end of this chapter of American darkness began here tonight, as love and hope and light join in the battle for the soul of the nation. And this is a battle we will win, and we’ll do it together, I promise you.” [music, Coldplay, “A Sky Full Of Stars”] Mr. Biden’s speech accepting his party’s presidential nomination capped one of the most extraordinary Democratic National Conventions in history. The final night hammered home the campaign’s message of the reunification, and its depiction of Mr. Biden as a big-tent candidate for a big-tent moment. Here are four moments that defined the last night of the convention. All week long, Democratic speakers struck a tone of urgency, not contenting themselves with the campaign cliché that “this is the most important election in our lifetimes.” Instead, they warned starkly about the very future of American democracy. In his speech, Mr. Biden returned to those themes. “This is a life-changing election,” Mr. Biden added. “This will determine what America is going to look for a long time.” In a final convention show of unity, Senator Cory Booker played host to a “Hollywood Squares”-type reunion of seven former presidential candidates, who offered their favorite memories of Mr. Biden, with some occasional comic relief from Senator Bernie Sanders. “You can think of this sort of like ‘Survivor’ on all of the people who have also ran,” Mr. Booker said. (Before moderating the tributes and recollections for Mr. Biden, Mr. Booker had a question for Mr. Sanders: “Why does my girlfriend like you more than me?”) Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the actor and Emmy-winning star of “Veep” who was Thursday night’s M.C., peppered her transitions with breezy but cutting comedy. Ms. Louis-Dreyfus set the tone early when bantering with Andrew Yang, the former presidential candidate. The two intentionally mispronounced Vice President Mike Pence’s name — a jab at the conservative pundits and politicians who regularly mangle Senator Kamala Harris’s given name. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta paid tribute to Representative John Lewis of Georgia, saying that the civil rights leader’s life story and passion for making “good trouble” represented the ideal the Democratic Party has been reaching for over the past week. “He walked gently amongst us, not as a distant icon but as a God-fearing man who did what he could to fulfill the as-yet-unfulfilled promise of America,” Ms. Bottoms said. She made particular note of Mr. Lewis’s signature issue, voting rights. — Nick Corasaniti Democrats are planning a broad slate of programming next week to coincide with the Republican National Convention and counter the shift of attention to President Trump. In an effort to paint Mr. Trump as an agent of “chaos,” the Democratic National Committee is expected to run TV and digital ads nationally and in battleground states that it said highlight “the many ways Trump has failed as president.” The Democrats also plan to host virtual events with Americans who have been affected negatively by the Trump presidency, and will circulate information in direct response to events at the Republicans’ convention. “We’re very interested in what will happen in their convention,” said Tom Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman. “We’ll take advantage of the haphazard nature of their convention to continue to take our message to the American people.” During the Democratic convention this week, President Trump hit the campaign trail, holding rally-like events in swing states including Minnesota, Wisconsin and near Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s hometown in Pennsylvania, and tweeting attacks during the convention itself. It was a stark departure from previous election cycles, when presidential candidates have traditionally gone dark during the other party’s convention. Mr. Biden’s campaign has not said whether he or his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, would themselves hold events next week. The Democrats plans to assign themes, such as “Economy in Crisis” and “Health Care in Crisis,” to each day of the Republican convention. Democratic leaders will host calls with the news media on each day of the Republican convention. Representative Val Demings of Florida will host on Monday; Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey on Tuesday; Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday; and the former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Thursday. — Sydney Ember In the run-up to the Democratic National Convention, the most closely guarded secret was how much time each speaker would get. Many privately jockeyed for extra time. In the end, the tone and substance of this week’s convention felt tailor-made for Joseph R. Biden Jr. Many of the leaders who received prime speaking slots were not unlike him, boasting years of government experience, party credentials and in many cases, a center-left ideology. — Matt Stevens As the Democrats’ first fully remote, virus-era convention wrapped up, our chief television critic, James Poniewozik, assessed the strange spectacle. While “incendiary applause lines don’t work the same when no one is there to clap,” he wrote, the format does work for “gravity and heart,” which Joseph R. Biden Jr. emphasized in his speech. Mr. Biden had concrete criticisms and counterarguments to the president, especially on fighting the coronavirus: “It didn’t have to be this bad.” But it was when Mr. Biden talked about feeling the pandemic and its devastation that you could feel the speech take off. He asked to speak to those who had lost someone to Covid. He had lost too, he said — the convention had reminded us of this, and a four-night character arc paid off in this moment. “I know how mean, cruel and unfair life can be sometimes,” he said. “Your loved one may have left this Earth, but they’ll never leave your heart.” There have been over 170,000 Americans lost to the pandemic but no real public mourning. Mr. Biden didn’t say anything about the president who, visiting the site of a mass shooting last year, posed with an orphaned baby and gave a thumbs up. He didn’t say that the country might miss having a leader who believes that feeling loss doesn’t make you a loser. He didn’t need to. The camera pushed in closer. Mr. Biden, like his running mate, Kamala Harris, spoke from a podium in a near-empty hall, which gave Ms. Harris’s speech a haunting air on Wednesday. This time, the camera held him tight in the frame, matching his intimate speech. It wasn’t written as if it were meant to rouse a cheering crowd in the room. It was written to the camera, like a presidential address, and reached through the screen to the other side. The speech did end like Ms. Harris’s, with music anticlimactically playing in the desolate hall as Mr. Biden waved to supporters on a big screen — a substitution much pandemic-era TV has made for live audiences that will never stop feeling uncanny. We spoke with Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, about her party’s national convention, which starts Monday. (This conversation has been edited and condensed.) You’re going to see a lot more of real people and a policy-driven discussion about the difference that the Trump administration has made in people’s lives and the things that they’ve done during the past four years, and then a preview of what the president is going to do when he’s re-elected. You’re going to see a tribute to America as we talk about the greatness of this country, a tribute to our history, our heroes, and it will be very aspirational. Democrats are featuring Hollywood celebrities who play real people, and the Republican convention will be about real people. We don’t need to hire actors to play real people. The Trump administration has always been about average everyday working Americans and their story. We don’t need screenwriters. We don’t need fiction. We’ll talk about real America and celebrate that. There’s not a lot of interaction. It’s all Zoom. Former Republicans. Kasich has classic Trump derangement syndrome. He’s not liked this president since the minute he was the nominee, even to the degree of not even coming onstage in his own state when it hosted the convention in 2016. It’s sad to watch them be part of a convention and a platform that is, in fact, ushering in socialism and fundamentally transforming the United States of America, as we know it. That’s what I think. — Lisa Lerer TRANSCRIPT Hi, my name is Brayden Harrington and I’m 13 years old. And without Joe Biden I wouldn’t be talking to you today. About a few months ago, I met him in New Hampshire. He told me that we were members of the same club. We stutter. It was really amazing to hear that someone like me became vice president. He told me about a book of poems by Yeats he would read out loud to practice. He showed me how he marks his addresses to make them easier to say out loud. So, I did the same thing today. And now I’m here talking to you today about the future, about our future. My family often says “when the world feels better” before talking about something normal, like going to the movies. We all want the world to feel better. We need the world to feel better. I’m just a regular kid. And in the short amount of time Joe Biden made me more confident about something that has bothered me my whole life. Joe Biden cared. Imagine what he could do for all of us. Kids like me are counting on you to elect someone we can all look up to, someone who cares, someone who will make our country and the world feel better. We’re counting on you to elect Joe Biden.  In a Democratic convention that was relatively short on surprises, a big one that packed an emotional wallop came from a young man who is still years away from being old enough to vote. “Hi, my name is Brayden Harrington, and I’m 13 years old,” he began somewhat haltingly, “and without Joe Biden I wouldn’t be talking to you today. About a few months ago, I met him in New Hampshire. He told me that we were members of the same club.” “We ——” a nation held its breath for nearly six seconds as Brayden struggled to get the word out “—— stutter.” Mr. Biden had a debilitating stutter as a child, and he has befriended young people he has met through the years who stutter as well. Brayden’s two-minute speech was a remarkable display of vulnerability and courage, and it reminded viewers who may have winced at Mr. Biden’s uneven performances that there can be more important qualities in a public speaker than clear and controlled cadences. He talked about how Mr. Biden had made him feel more confident and hopeful about what he could accomplish. Then he wrapped up his remarks in a way that eloquently captured Mr. Biden’s core message. “We all want the world to feel better,” he said. “We need the world to feel better.” — Andy Newman and Glenn Thrush Facebook spent years preparing to ward off any tampering on its site ahead of November’s presidential election. Now the social network is getting ready in case President Trump interferes once the vote is over. Employees at the company are laying out contingency plans and walking through postelection scenarios that include attempts by Mr. Trump or his campaign to use the platform to delegitimize the results, people with knowledge of Facebook’s plans said. Facebook is preparing steps to take should Mr. Trump wrongly claim on the site that he won another four-year term, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Facebook is also working through how it might act if Mr. Trump tries to invalidate the results by declaring that the Postal Service lost mail-in ballots or that other groups meddled with the vote, the people said. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and some of his lieutenants have started holding daily meetings about minimizing how the platform can be used to dispute the election, the people said. They have discussed a “kill switch” to shut off political advertising after Election Day since the ads, which Facebook does not police for truthfulness, could be used to spread misinformation, the people said. — Mike Isaac and Sheera Frenkel A new drive to get Kanye West on the ballot in Arizona is underway after similar efforts in the swing states of Ohio and Wisconsin were rejected this week. A signature-gathering campaign in Arizona is being led by Edee Baggett, who is only the latest Trump supporter to aid Mr. West. In April, she expressed support for the president’s re-election on her Facebook page: “He is my President … he is our President and he should be everyone’s president as he is working for us,” she wrote, while allowing that “he’s crude and can be rude” and “should tweet less.” In an interview, Ms. Baggett, who runs a signature-gathering firm called National Ballot Access, stressed that she worked on both sides of the aisle — for “probably more Democrats than Republicans.” She said she had done work for the campaigns of Tulsi Gabbard and Marianne Williamson, adding that “nobody that I know from any party has told me I need you to do this on the sneak. I don’t work that way.” Mr. West was rejected by elections officials in Wisconsin on Thursday, because his signatures were submitted just after the deadline, and on Friday in Ohio because of problems with his nominating petition and statement of candidacy. Many Democrats view him as a spoiler, since several of the president’s allies and supporters have been linked to his campaign, including a Trump campaign lawyer who delivered Mr. West’s signatures to Wisconsin elections officials. Mr. West also recently met with the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for what Mr. Kushner described as a “general discussion more about policy.” Mr. West is still aiming to get on the ballot in Virginia, Idaho, Wyoming, Kentucky and North Dakota, where another signature-gathering group, Let the Voters Decide, is working on his behalf. Signatures must be delivered in Arizona by Sept. 4. “This is a very short deadline,” said Ms. Baggett, who was hired about a week ago. “All we can do is try.” — Danny Hakim Since he left the White House in 2017, Stephen K. Bannon has promoted himself as a political provocateur still fighting for an underclass left behind by open borders and free trade, even as he forged a financial relationship with a fugitive Chinese billionaire and traveled the world to dole out advice on running populist movements. Mr. Bannon also stayed connected to President Trump, giving the impression he was quietly counseling the president from afar in recent months as his re-election campaign stumbled. But Mr. Bannon’s self-made image as a champion of people the president has called “the forgotten men and women” was shattered on Thursday when he was arrested on charges of defrauding donors to a campaign to privately fund a wall on the United States’ southern border with Mexico, one of Mr. Trump’s signature political promises. Pledging publicly not to take any of the proceeds for themselves, Mr. Bannon and the other suspects instead siphoned hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay for travel, hotels, personal credit card debt and other expenses, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said. Mr. Bannon was arrested on the yacht of the Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui off the coast of Connecticut early Thursday, becoming the latest person linked to Mr. Trump to be indicted during his presidency. Mr. Bannon pleaded not guilty in a hearing on Thursday afternoon in Manhattan. The president sought to distance himself from the ill-fated wall fund-raising campaign that led to Mr. Bannon’s indictment. “I didn’t like that project,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Thursday in the Oval Office. “I thought that was a project that was being done for showboating reasons.” — Maggie Haberman, Michael S.
