Live Updates: Where Will the Convention Go Next?<br></h1><p id="artcont">Louis DeJoy, the postmaster general, will testify before the Senate on Friday as concerns grow over mail-in voting. Night 1 went relatively smoothly for the Democrats. What will Night 2 bring? A most unusual convention is now underway. Democrats don’t agree on everything (or even much). Except for beating Trump. Michelle Obama makes an impassioned case for Biden. Trump hits back at Michelle Obama on Twitter. TRANSCRIPT “We the people call the 48th quadrennial Democratic National Convention to order.” ♫ “... and the home of the brave.” ♫ “Welcome to our convention across America. We had hoped to gather in one place, but instead, we figured out a safe and responsible way to come together to share our ideas and talk about the future of our country.” “George should be alive today. Breonna Taylor should be alive today. Ahmaud Arbery should be alive today. Eric Garner should be alive today. Stephon Clark, Atatiana Jefferson, Sandra Bland. They should all be alive today. Please join me in a moment of silence.” “My dad, Mark Anthony Urquiza, should be here today. But he isn’t. He had faith in Donald Trump. He voted for him, listened to him, believed him and his mouthpieces when they said that coronavirus was under control and going to disappear, that it was OK to end social distancing rules before it was safe, and that if you had no underlying health conditions you’d probably be fine. My dad was a healthy 65-year-old. His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump — and for that he paid with his life.” “I’m a lifelong Republican, but that attachment holds second place to my responsibility to my country. That’s why I’ve chosen to appear at this convention. In normal times, something like this would probably never happen. But these are not normal times.” “At its most basic, this election is about preserving our democracy. During this president’s term, the unthinkable has become normal. He has tried to prevent people from voting, undermined the U.S. Postal Service, deployed the military and federal agents against peaceful protesters, threatened to delay the election and suggested that he will not leave office if he loses. Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Trump golfs. His actions fanned this pandemic, resulting in over 170,000 deaths and a nation still unprepared to protect its people.” “Empathy — that’s something I’ve been thinking a lot about lately. The ability to walk in someone else’s shoes. The recognition that someone else’s experience has value too. But right now, kids in this country are seeing what happens when we stop requiring empathy of one another. They’re looking around wondering if we’ve been lying to them this whole time about who we are and what we truly value. They see people shouting in grocery stores, unwilling to wear a mask to keep us all safe. They see people calling the police on folks minding their own business just because of the color of their skin. So let me be as honest and clear as I possibly can. Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is. So if you take one thing from my words tonight, it is this. If you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me, they can and they will if we don’t make a change in this election.” The opening night of the Democratic National Convention might well go down as a strange digital artifact of an election year defined by pandemic-induced weirdness. But there were no major technical glitches during the first few hours of the first-ever virtual party gathering — and Michelle Obama’s comprehensive takedown of President Trump left Democrats feeling relatively fired up and ready to go, albeit from their couches, ahead of Day 2. The most-watched moment on Tuesday might come from one of the shortest time slots: Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s minute or so of speaking time to praise her chosen primary candidate, Bernie Sanders. Jill Biden, the nominee’s wife and an educator, will have a much more expansive role, as will Bill Clinton, whose second-day speaking slot speaks to a diminished influence in a party now defined by Joseph R. Biden Jr., former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, who will address the convention on Wednesday. Tuesday’s events will again run from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern time. There are several ways to watch: The Times will stream the full convention every day, accompanied by chat-based live analysis from our reporters and real-time highlights from the speeches. You can download our iOS or Android app and turn on notifications to be alerted when our live analysis starts. The official livestream will be here. It will also be available on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Twitch. ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News will air the convention from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. each night. C-SPAN, CNN, MSNBC and PBS will cover the full two hours each night. Here’s more information on how to stream the convention on various platforms. Who’s speaking tonight: Jill Biden, Mr. Biden’s wife and the former second lady Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware Former President Bill Clinton John Kerry, the former secretary of state and 2004 Democratic presidential nominee Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York Senator Chuck Schumer of New York Sally Yates, the former acting attorney general — Glenn Thrush and Maggie Astor Louis DeJoy, the postmaster general, will testify before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Friday amid mounting concerns about cuts in the Postal Service, which voting rights advocates say could threaten the integrity of mail-in voting in the November election. Senator Gary C. Peters of Michigan, the top Democrat on the committee, said in a statement: “The Postal Service is a lifeline for Michiganders and Americans across the country who depend on reliable mail service, especially in rural communities — and we must ensure they can continue to count on dependable and timely delivery no matter where they live.” He added: “I will continue pressing for answers on Mr. DeJoy’s recent directives and their impacts on all Americans, who rely on the Postal Service for prescriptions, running their small businesses, voting and other crucial purposes.” — Emily Cochrane Democrats opened the most extraordinary presidential nominating convention in recent history on Monday night with a program that spanned the ideological gamut from socialists to Republicans, and at times more closely resembled an online awards show than a traditional summer pageant of American democracy. The two-hour event, truncated and conducted virtually because of the coronavirus crisis, was a vivid illustration of how widespread opposition to President Trump and the still-raging pandemic have upended the country’s politics. Kicking off a four-day conclave during which they hope to both win over moderates who are uneasy with Mr. Trump’s divisive leadership and energize liberals who are unenthusiastic about their own nominee, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrats reached for the recent past. They showcased the leader of the left and their reigning presidential runner-up, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; a handful of Republican defectors, including former Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio; and the most popular figure from the previous administration — the former first lady, Michelle Obama. With no arena, and no loudspeaker to introduce the presenters, Democrats turned to an M.C. of sorts, the actress Eva Longoria, who kept the evening moving between prerecorded and live video presentations. A lineup of political luminaries delivered remarks in rapid-fire format and only a few of them — Mrs. Obama, for one, and Mr. Sanders — possessed the sheer star power to linger in the perception of the audience. “The past four years have left us, as a nation, diminished and divided,” Ms. Longoria said at the opening of the program, alluding to the pandemic, its economic devastation and much else. After introductory segments, the program devoted attention to the protests against racial injustice. Appearing above the Black Lives Matter logo painted on the street across from the White House, the mayor of the District of Columbia, Muriel E. Bowser, recounted her anger over Mr. Trump’s deployment of federal troops against protesters this summer. “I said ‘Enough’ for every Black and brown American who has experienced injustice,” Ms. Bowser said. Perhaps the most searing critique of Mr. Trump came not from an elected official but from Kristin Urquiza, a young woman whose father, a Trump supporter, died of the coronavirus. Speaking briefly and in raw terms about her loss, Ms. Urquiza said of her father, “His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that he paid with his life.” — Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns The Democratic primary race began as a clash of ideas. But when the Democratic National Convention convened on Monday, the party assembled with a single aim: defeating President Trump. From the progressive left to the moderate wing, Mr. Trump has served for months as the glue keeping the party from fracturing. And never has this détente been more obvious than in the wide-ranging lineup for the first night of the convention, when, in the name of unity, the virtual stage was open not just to Democrats of various persuasions but to Republicans as well. The festivities conveyed one message from the Democrats. Whatever their ideological differences with one another or the Democratic nominee Joseph R. Biden Jr., ousting Mr. Trump was the primary concern. “We have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it,” said Michelle Obama, the former first lady. The appeal came from other political leaders including former Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, a onetime Republican candidate for president; Senator Bernie Sanders, the progressive standard-bearer; and also Democratic moderates including Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. The speakers made clear that unity does not mean total agreement. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Kasich were both explicit in saying that they disagree with Mr. Biden on some matters, but are behind him nonetheless. “I’m a lifelong Republican, but that attachment holds second place to my responsibility to my country,” Mr. Kasich said. — Astead W. Herndon and Sydney Ember TRANSCRIPT Over the past four years, a lot of people have asked me, “When others are going so low, does going high still really work?” My answer? Going high is the only thing that works. Because when we go low, when we use those same tactics of degrading and dehumanizing others, we just become part of the ugly noise that’s drowning out everything else. We degrade ourselves. We degrade the very causes for which we fight. But let’s be clear. Going high does not mean putting on a smile and saying nice things when confronted by viciousness and cruelty. Going high means taking the harder path. It means scraping and clawing our way to that mountaintop. Going high means standing fierce against hatred while remembering that we are one nation under God — and if we want to survive, we’ve got to find a way to live together and work together across our differences. So let me be as honest and clear as I possibly can. Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is. Casting aside her reluctance to engage in political combat, Michelle Obama delivered an impassioned keynote address to cap off the first night of the Democratic convention and offered a withering assessment of President Trump, accusing him of creating “chaos,” sowing “division” and governing “with a total and utter lack of empathy.” Mrs. Obama, the former first lady, spoke emphatically into the camera and gave a scathing, point-by-point analysis of Mr. Trump’s presidency in an urgent summons for Democratic voters to cast ballots in any way they could, even if it meant waiting in long lines to do so. She began by questioning the very legitimacy of Mr. Trump’s election in 2016, pointing out that he had lost the popular tally by “three million votes.” She went on to attack the president’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and said that the strong economy Mr. Trump inherited from her husband four years ago was “in shambles.” She also said Mr. Trump’s divisive approach on race relations had emboldened “torch-bearing white supremacists,” and ripped him for a lack of “leadership or consolation or any semblance of steadiness.” Mrs. Obama began all of this by declaring, “You know, I hate politics.” Then she dove right in. “Let me be as honest and clear as I possibly can: Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country,” Mrs. Obama said, offering a potent closing argument to a packed online program that seemed, at times, like an overpopulated Zoom call. “He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head,” she said. “He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us.” “It is what it is,” she added, appearing to quote Mr. Trump, who uttered the same sentence earlier this month when speaking of the 150,000 American coronavirus deaths and was criticized as callous for it. — Glenn Thrush President Trump on Tuesday bristled at the stinging rebuke of his performance as commander in chief by the former first lady, Michelle Obama, in her keynote speech during the first night of the Democratic National Convention. Mr. Trump, who has generally avoided engaging Mrs. Obama since taking office, responded to her primetime speech in a series of tweets targeting his predecessor in the Oval Office. He also questioned the alliance between former President Barack Obama and the former vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., pointing to Mr. Obama’s decision to wait until April to endorse his onetime running mate for president. Somebody please explain to @MichelleObama that Donald J. Trump would not be here, in the beautiful White House, if it weren’t for the job done by your husband, Barack Obama. Biden was merely an afterthought, a good reason for that very late & unenthusiastic endorsement..... In her prerecorded speech, Mrs. Obama admonished Mr. Trump’s character and said that the country’s standing in the world had by stained by his petty attacks and extreme agenda. She said that he lacked the temperament and empathy required to hold the nation’s highest office. “He cannot meet this moment,” Mrs. Obama said. “He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us.” Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday that his administration “built the greatest economy in history, of any country, turned it off, saved millions of lives.” He also accused his predecessors of “spying on my campaign” and called the Obama and Biden administration as “the most corrupt in history.” — Neil Vigdor Michelle Obama, who anchored the Democratic convention Monday night, spoke longest, followed by Eva Longoria, the actress who hosted the event. Four Republicans who stepped up for Joseph R. Biden Jr. — including the former Ohio governor John R. Kasich — spoke for a total of about five and a half minutes. Monday’s lineup of speakers was intended to convey the broad ideological support for Mr. Biden — from Republicans like Mr. Kasich to Senator Bernie Sanders. Heading into the four-day convention, the most closely guarded secret was how much time each speaker would get during the two-hour window each night. Party officials said the average speech length would clock in at two minutes — after accounting for the five major addresses from the Obamas, the Bidens and Senator Kamala Harris, Mr. Biden’s running mate. Speakers spent recent weeks privately jockeying with convention organizers for extra time. With so little time to divide among so many speakers representing the ideological, racial and geographic diversity of the party, convention planners have been careful not to advertise how much time each speaker received, to avoid causing hurt feelings in advance of the virtual event. — Weiyi Cai and Reid J.
