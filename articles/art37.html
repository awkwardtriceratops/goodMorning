Epstein This article will be updated regularly with new pictures. Election Day is always the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, but the day circled on the calendar every four years is no longer the singular time when American elections happen. That day, Nov. 3 this year, instead represents the end of a six-week sprint during which many Americans — a record number in 2020 — cast their ballots in advance. The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated a trend toward more early voting. In an effort to make polling places less crowded on Election Day, many states have encouraged absentee voting, opened more in-person early-voting sites and, in a few cases, mailed ballots to all registered voters. In state after state, voters have waited in line for hours — particularly on the first day in-person early voting became available. When most of Georgia opened for in-person voting on Columbus Day, voters in the Atlanta suburbs waited four, five, even seven hours to vote. The next day in Texas, turnout in a few counties was equivalent to more than 10 percent of those counties’ entire vote in the 2016 election. While the long lines are a vivid symbol of longstanding efforts to make voting more difficult — particularly for people of color — they also demonstrate the intensity of the desire to vote in an election that millions of Americans have waited for since the last one, when President Trump won a victory that shocked the country, exhilarating his supporters and infuriating large parts of the country. This year, millions of Americans voted as soon as they could. They sent ballots back in the mail, deposited them into drop boxes, handed them off to municipal clerks or county elections boards, or went to early-voting centers where, at least in the first few days, voters reported festive atmospheres that were free of the angst that often comes with spending hours waiting to vote on Election Day. It has been a public demonstration of civic devotion unseen in American life for generations, but also evidence of what in many places remains a broken voting system, damaged either by neglect or intent. Yet the voters keep coming, intent on exercising a constitutional right and in hopes of shaping a better future for their country.
