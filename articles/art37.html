By John Koblin RIGHT NOW “Watchmen,” a take on the comic book series that addressed social issues like police brutality and white supremacy, won best limited series. It took “Schitt’s Creek” several seasons to catch on. A few months after its series finale, the big-hearted Canadian comedy was the hit of the 72nd Emmy Awards. “Schitt’s Creek” swept every comedy award handed out on Sunday night, including the top prize in best comedy. The first hour of the Emmys broadcast was dominated by the show, whose cast members had gathered for a viewing party in Toronto. Daniel Levy, the 37-year-old writer, actor and director who created the show with his father, Eugene Levy, won four Emmys: for writing, directing, best supporting actor and for best comedy. “Oh no, oh no,” Levy said, as he accepted the Emmy for best supporting actor, his third of the night. “The internet’s about to turn on me. I’m so sorry.” The show’s stars, longtime colleagues Catherine O’Hara and Eugene Levy, won best acting in a comedy honors for their husband-and-wife roles on the comedy. The Emmys were their first since the early 1980s, when they won for writing on the groundbreaking comedy series “SCTV.” O’Hara thanked the Levys for giving her the chance “to play a woman of a certain age — my age — who fully gets to be her ridiculous self.” To round it out for Rose family on “Schitt’s Creek,” Annie Murphy won for best supporting actress in a comedy, too. Daniel Levy’s four wins represented the biggest haul for anyone during the main prime-time telecast, a spokesman for the Television Academy said. “Schitt’s Creek” airs on Pop TV in the United States and attracted new viewers after its past seasons started streaming on Netflix in recent years. The limited series category has become the Emmy ceremony’s glamour zone, with its big stars and blockbuster budgets. This year, a pair of shows that confronted social issues are in the lead: HBO’s “Watchmen” and the FX and Hulu mini-series “Mrs. America.” “Watchmen,” Damon Lindelof’s ambitious take of the comic book genre, is the more likely winner. In addition to scoring the most nominations of any series this year, it recently won the Television Critics Association award for best series. At the same event, “Mrs. America,” an examination of the battle for the Equal Rights Amendment, was shut out. Regina King, the masked hero in “Watchmen,” won best actress in a limited series. It was her fourth Emmy win. Lights! Camera! And … let’s hope the Wi-Fi works. The 72nd Emmy Awards on Sunday at 8 p.m. Eastern time looked nothing like the earlier ceremonies celebrating the year’s achievements in television and streaming. Red carpet? Canceled. Actors seated shoulder to shoulder in an auditorium as the envelopes are unsealed? Nope. Jimmy Kimmel kicked off the ceremony from a nearly empty Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. “Welcome to the Pand-Emmys,” Kimmel said. In the opening moments, he appeared to deliver his jokes to a live audience — but it was just footage of crowds from past broadcasts that made it seem as if Oprah Winfrey, Michael Douglas and Jon Hamm were laughing at his remarks. Kimmel eventually gave up the bit to reveal that he was facing rows of empty seats, some of them filled with cardboard cutouts of television stars. “Of course we don’t have an audience,” Kimmel said. “This isn’t a MAGA rally.” More than 100 nominees watched his monologue — and would soon broadcast themselves — from locations ranging from Berlin to Fayetteville, Ga. (Some prominent nominees did not bother with it — Cate Blanchett, up for best actress in a limited series, skipped the ceremony, as did Michael Douglas who was up for best actor in a comedy). In an effort to make the broadcast go as smoothly as possible, the Television Academy sent a kit to each nominee with instructions on how to put together a D.I.Y. studio. It comes complete with a ring light, a microphone, a laptop and a camera. Several presenters and entertainers — including Jennifer Aniston, Tracee Ellis Ross and Jason Batemen — joined Kimmel on a stage built above the Staples Center basketball court. The show was moved from its usual spot, the Microsoft Theater, to the home of the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers, because the arena has the technological wherewithal to accommodate dozens of remote feeds. “We’ve all done some of the biggest award shows ever but none of us have done anything on this scale before,” said Reginald Hudlin, an executive producer. HBO’s operatic drama, “Succession,” is the favorite for the most prestigious award, best drama. This chronicle of a cutthroat clan won best drama honors at the Golden Globes and the Television Critics Association Awards earlier this year, and the show’s creator, Jesse Armstrong, won the Emmy for best drama writing in 2019. Other contenders have emerged to take the place of “Game of Thrones,” the HBO epic that won this category a record-tying four times. Netflix has a pair of possible winners in “The Crown” and “Ozark.” And don’t count out the Baby Yoda smash, “The Mandalorian.” The Disney+ action-adventure series won a number of technical Creative Arts Emmys, which were given out last week, and Television Academy voters do not scrunch their noses at mass entertainment. Olivia Colman, an Oscar and Golden Globe winner who plays the lead in Netflix’s “The Crown,” will face off against the four-time Emmy winner Laura Linney, a star of Netflix’s “Ozark,” in the best actress category. Other nominees include Jennifer Aniston (“The Morning Show”), last year’s best drama winner, Jodie Comer (“Killing Eve”), her castmate Sandra Oh, and last year’s breakout star, Zendaya (“Euphoria”). Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong, who portray the father and son of a feuding dynasty on “Succession,” will compete against each other in real life as the top contenders for best actor in a drama. If they split the vote, Jason Bateman, a star of “Ozark,” could be the beneficiary. Catherine O’Hara and Eugene Levy earned some Emmy love, winning in the lead acting comedy categories for their roles as the husband-and-wife duo in “Schitt’s Creek.” The two stars of the series have won Emmys before — but not since the early 1980s, when they were recognized as writers for the work on the groundbreaking Canadian comedy series “SCTV.” In fact, only a few series have ever swept best comedy and top acting honors in the same year, including “30 Rock,” (Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin) “All in the Family” (Carroll O’Connor, Jean Stapleton) and “The Dick Van Dyke Show” (Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore). It’s getting hard to remember a time when “Saturday Night Live” had fallen out of favor with Emmy voters, as it had for years. But the recent winning streak of Lorne Michaels’s NBC juggernaut continues. “S.N.L.” won best sketch variety series for the fourth year in a row, and it swept guest acting honors as well. Maya Rudolph won best guest actress in a comedy for her depiction of Kamala Harris. And Eddie Murphy was given guest acting honors for his hosting duties on the same episode, in which he reprised vintage characters like Gumby, Buckwheat and Mr. Robinson. It was his first Emmy win. Don Roy King also won for best directing in a variety sketch series for his work on the episode hosted by Murphy. “S.N.L.” is the most decorated series in Emmys history, having won 73 Primetime Emmys. Cherry Jones (“Succession”) and Ron Cephas Jones (“This Is Us”) won the drama guest acting awards. RuPaul, of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” won best host of a reality series for a fifth time, setting a record in the category. All of these awards were given out during the weeklong Creative Arts Emmy virtual ceremonies. Now that the technical and guest acting honors are out of the way, “The Mandalorian” and “Watchmen” find themselves tied for the lead in total Emmy wins, with 7 apiece going into Sunday. In recent years, Netflix and HBO have waged hard-fought battles against each other on the big night, and each has won 19 Emmys so far this week. A final 23 awards will be handed out during the Sunday ceremony. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
