Over 50 million Americans have voted, exceeding the early-vote total for 2016. As their governor resists mask mandate, Iowans sour on the G.O.P. Biden’s vow to ‘transition away from the oil industry’ is a double-edged political sword. Florida, where Trump is campaigning, has the third highest tally of coronavirus cases in the nation. After laying out starkly different outlooks at the debate, Trump and Biden are back on the trail. Authorities charge man affiliated with far-right group over Minneapolis violence. With the presidential race hurtling into its final stretch, Joseph R. Biden Jr. sought Friday to amplify the closing argument he delivered on the debate stage a night earlier, accusing President Trump of failing to stem the ballooning coronavirus crisis and vowing more aggressive federal action for the “dark winter ahead.” In a speech near his home in Wilmington, Del., Mr. Biden denounced Mr. Trump’s familiar assertion that the pandemic was “rounding the corner” and “going away” even as cases surge across the country, placing the blame for the rising death toll squarely at the president’s feet. “As I told him last night, we’re not learning to live with it. We’re learning to die with it,” Mr. Biden said, while noting the more than 220,000 people who have already died from the virus. Arguing that the coronavirus “isn’t showing any signs of slowing down,” Mr. Biden repeated with a tone of incredulity Mr. Trump's comments earlier in the week that he would do “not much” differently if he were given the opportunity for a do-over. “As many as 210,000 avoidable deaths, and there’s not much he would do differently?” Mr. Biden said, citing figures from a recent study out of Columbia University. “If this is a success, what’s a failure look like?” Mr. Biden’s remarks came one day after he and Mr. Trump met on stage for the second and final time. Coming out of the debate, both men sought on Friday to build momentum heading into the last days of the campaign. While Mr. Biden was delivering his speech in Delaware, Mr. Trump was preparing to host two rallies in Florida. Both men have campaign stops scheduled for the weekend in key battleground states. During his address, Mr. Biden laid out the immediate steps he would take to rein in the coronavirus if elected. He also said he would ask Congress to put a bill on his desk by the end of January outlining the resources needed for the country’s public health and economic response to the virus. Mr. Biden said he would ask every governor to institute mask mandates; if they refused, he said, he would work with local officials to get local mandates in place nationwide. And he said he would require masks in federal buildings and on interstate transportation. Once again connecting the future of the Affordable Care Act to the Supreme Court battle, Mr. Biden warned that overturning the health law would mean people would have to pay for a potential coronavirus vaccine and vowed to make it free for everyone. — Sydney Ember THE EARLY VOTE With 11 days to go until Election Day more than 50 million people have already cast their ballots, according to the U.S. Elections Project — which is more early votes than the project tallied during the entire early-voting period in 2016. The early-voting turnout, which combines mail-in ballots already received as well as early in-person voting, stood at 52.6 million as of Friday afternoon, according to the U.S. Elections Project, which tracks state-by-state data. That surpassed the number of early votes that the project counted in all of 2016, when it tallied over 47 million. Voters across the nation have already cast more than 38 percent of all the votes that were counted in the 2016 presidential election. Campaign officials and elections experts are still trying to understand the extent to which the high early vote totals suggest that the election is on pace to see record turnout this year, or whether they are yet another reflection of how 2020, and the coronavirus pandemic, have reordered so many aspects of life, including voting. Many early voters hope to avoid the risks of contracting the coronavirus by standing in long lines on Election Day. Fears of widespread postal delays have prompted many to mail in their ballots earlier than usual. Others are opting to vote early in person, including Democrats who distrust the U.S. Postal Service and Trump supporters who are heeding the president’s repeated assertions that mail-in balloting is insecure. (Voter fraud is extremely rare in all forms, including mail-in balloting.) Not all states report the party registration of those who vote early, but the early vote in the states that do has leaned heavily Democratic so far. Of those who have already voted, 50.3 percent are registered Democrats, 27 percent are Republicans and 22 percent are unaffiliated, according to the U.S. Elections Project. But it is too early to draw significant conclusions on whether that’s good or bad news for the candidates; analysts widely expect many of Mr. Trump’s voters to turn out in person on Election Day, while Mr. Biden is expected to capture more mail-in votes that might not be counted until following days and weeks. Some states have already received more than half the votes they counted in 2016. In Texas, 71.1 percent of the total 2016 turnout has already voted. Georgia, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Vermont have passed half their 2016 totals. Early voting has not yet begun in other states, including New York, which begins on Saturday.

Kim Reynolds appeared at an indoor fund-raiser for the Republican Party this week, just days after joining President Trump at one of his huge rallies in Des Moines, where she tossed hats to the clamorous crowd. At neither event were social distancing or face masks high priorities. The rally last week defied guidelines by the White House’s own health experts that crowds in central Iowa be limited to 25. Iowa’s governor is not on the ballot next month. But her defiant attitude toward the advice of health experts on how to fight the coronavirus outbreak, as her state sees a grim tide of new cases and deaths, may be dragging down fellow Republicans who are running, including Mr. Trump and Senator Joni Ernst. Ms. Reynolds, the first woman to lead Iowa, is an avatar of the president’s approach to the pandemic, refusing to issue mandates and flouting the guidance of infectious disease experts, who say that universal masking and social distancing are essential to limiting the virus’s spread. Defying that advice has eroded support for both Mr. Trump and Ms. Reynolds in Iowa, especially among voters over 65, normally a solid Republican constituency, according to public and private polls. A Monmouth University poll on Thursday showed Democrats are leading in three of Iowa’s four congressional races, with even the fourth, in deeply conservative Northwest Iowa, unexpectedly tight. Rick Flanagan, a 61-year-old voter from Newton who had planned to vote for Ms. Ernst in the Senate race, recalled the moment he changed his mind in favor of her Democratic opponent. It was “when Ernst said she didn’t believe the deaths and the science from Covid,” Mr. Flanagan said, referring to remarks by Ms. Ernst echoing a conspiracy theory that coronavirus deaths were being inflated and that medical professionals had a financial incentive to do so. “That sealed it for me, and honestly, it soured me on Republicans,” Mr. Flanagan said. Ms. Ernst walked back her remarks and apologized to health care workers. — Trip Gabriel and Astead W. Herndon Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s pledge at Thursday night’s debate to “transition away from the oil industry” in order to address climate change put the issue at center stage, in the final stretch of a campaign in which the warming planet has played a larger role than ever before. His statement gave President Trump what his campaign saw as an enormous opportunity to blunt his opponent’s appeal to working-class voters. Mr. Biden’s campaign tried to downplay it, saying he was merely stating that he would phase out longstanding tax subsidies for the oil industry. But transitioning away from fossil fuels is the inevitable end game of Mr. Biden’s promise to end net carbon pollution by 2050. That policy has energized some young voters and helped unite the Democrats’ left and moderate wings, but has always carried risks for Mr. Biden. “Basically what he is saying is, he is going to destroy the oil industry,” Mr. Trump charged, adding, straight to the camera, “Will you remember that, Texas? Will you remember that, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma?” The line was reminiscent of the Republican response in 2016 to Hillary Clinton’s acknowledgment that “we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business” as the nation moves to clean energy. Those comments resonated in coal states like West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wyoming. Mr. Biden’s comments may focus attention on a different set of battlegrounds, such as Texas and New Mexico. (An earlier version of the article this briefing item is based on misattributed a statement about fossil fuel to M.J. Hegar, the Democratic Senate candidate in Texas; the error was repeated in the briefing item and has since been removed.) Representative Xochitl Torres Small, an endangered freshman Democrat in New Mexico, said on Twitter, “We need to work together to promote responsible energy production and stop climate change, not demonize a single industry.” While more alluded to than stated outright, transitioning from fossil fuels will be necessary to meet Mr. Biden’s goals of eliminating emissions from the power sector by 2035 and reaching net-zero emissions across the economy by 2050. Yet Mr. Biden has walked a fine line throughout the campaign, insisting that natural gas production — and the jobs it creates — will remain a core part of the United States energy composition for several years to come, even as he envisions a future powered more by wind, solar and other renewable sources. Some energy experts said the Trump campaign’s attacks on Mr. Biden may not have the same resonance as those on Mrs. Clinton four years ago, in large part because public understanding of climate change has grown and the major oil companies of the world have, to varying degrees, pledged to reduce their emissions. “This is a playbook that they keep coming back to, and it’s less and less effective,” said Joshua Freed, who leads the climate and energy program at Third Way, a center-left think tank. “The economy is moving on and the public is moving on.” — Lisa Friedman  More than 55 million people watched the second and final presidential debate between President Trump and his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to preliminary numbers from Nielsen. The viewership total will rise as Nielsen collects data from more networks and out-of-home viewers. But it appears the audience on Thursday is tracking to be smaller than the one for last month’s raucous duel. That first debate, which was notable for Mr. Trump’s repeated interruptions, notched 73.1 million viewers, making it the third most-viewed general-election matchup since Nielsen started keeping records in 1976. The preliminary figure for Thursday’s debate included three cable news channels — CNN, Fox News and MSNBC — and the Big Three broadcast networks. Fox News, once again, drew the largest audience of any network, with 14.7 million viewers. Both NBC and ABC — which featured coverage of the event before the 9 p.m. start time — had roughly 10 million viewers. With the second debate called off after Mr. Trump objected to its virtual format, Thursday’s event in Nashville amounted to the president’s final chance to make his case for re-election to a mass audience. The two candidates participated in televised town halls last week, events that attracted only about 28 million viewers in total, a fraction of the audience for a debate airing simultaneously on more than a dozen networks. Mr. Biden’s town hall attracted more viewers than Mr. Trump’s. The final viewership figure that Nielsen releases on Friday will include people who streamed the debate on their television screens, but not viewers who watched it solely on digital devices. There are still no widely accepted ratings measures for the full digital audience. Over the years, ratings for the final presidential debate have bounced around in different directions. Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton’s final debate attracted more viewers than their second, but fewer than their first. Barack Obama and Mitt Romney’s third debate in 2012 was the least viewed of the cycle. In 1984 and 1988 — when only two presidential debates were held in each election cycle — the final debates attracted more viewers. — John Koblin and Michael M. Grynbaum THE STATE OF THE STATES Florida, the perennially competitive state where President Trump is campaigning Friday, is one of the states hardest hit by the coronavirus. The Villages, the sprawling retirement community in Central Florida where he is scheduled to hold his next rally, was not spared. George W. Bush won twice in Florida (the first time after the contested 2000 election went to the courts), as did Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Mr. Trump won Florida in 2016. The state, whose 29 electoral votes make it a rich prize, is yet again considered a tossup. A win there is critical to Mr. Trump’s re-election hopes, but he will have to campaign hard for it. An average of recent Florida polls show former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. with a narrow edge of 3 percentage points, according to the Upshot’s calculator. Here is how Florida is doing on two of the biggest issues of the day, the coronavirus and the economy. Florida has reported at least 768,083 coronavirus cases, the third highest tally in the nation, and 16,266 deaths, the fourth highest toll, according to a New York Times database. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a Republican ally of Mr. Trump’s, was criticized for declaring prematurely in April that the state had “flattened the curve,” and for moving swiftly to reopen businesses. Infections soon began to surge, and the state became a Sun Belt hot spot over the summer, at some points in July averaging more than 11,000 new cases each day, according to the database. While cases in Florida are down sharply from their highest point, they are climbing again: Over the past week, Florida has seen an average of 3,300 new cases per day, according to the database, an increase of 37 percent from the average two weeks earlier. Florida’s unemployment rate in September stood at 7.6 percent, according to data compiled by Moody’s Analytics, slightly below the national average of 7.9 percent. And to answer one of the most basic questions of a re-election campaign — are you better off today than you were four years ago? — unemployment in Florida is higher than it was in September 2016, when it stood at 4.8 percent. The state is still down more than half a million jobs from its peak earlier this year. There are 11 days until Election Day. Here are the schedules of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates for Friday, Oct. 23. All times are Eastern time. President Trump 4:30 p.m.: Holds a rally in The Villages, Fla., a retirement community. 7 p.m.: Holds a rally in Pensacola, Fla. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. 2:30 p.m.: Speaks about the pandemic in Wilmington, Del. Vice President Mike Pence 1 p.m.: Held a rally in Swanton, Ohio. 4:30 p.m.: Holds a rally in West Mifflin, Pa. Senator Kamala Harris 5 p.m.: Visits Atlanta to promote early voting. — Michael Cooper TRANSCRIPT “If we just wore these masks, the president’s own advisers have told him, we could save 100,000 lives. And we’re in a circumstance where the president, thus far, still has no plan, no comprehensive plan.” “You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks.” “Yes.” “Is that a guarantee? Is —” “No, it’s not a guarantee, but it will be by the end of the year. But I think it has a good chance — there are two companies — I think within a matter of weeks. And it will be distributed very quickly.” “This is the same fellow who told you this was going to end by Easter last time. This is the same fellow who told you that, don’t worry, we’re going to end this by the summer. We’re about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter. And he has no clear plan, and there’s no prospect that there’s going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.” “President Trump, your reaction. He says you have no plan.” “I don’t think we’re going to have a dark winter at all. We’re opening up our country. We’ve learned and studied and understand the disease.” “He says that we’re, you know, we’re learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home who have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their — out of habit, where their wife or husband was — is gone. Learning to live with it? Come on. We’re dying with it.” “I take full responsibility. It’s not my fault that it came here. It’s China’s fault. And you know what? It’s not Joe’s fault that it came here either. It’s China’s fault. First of all, I’ve already done something that nobody thought was possible: Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare. He’s talking about socialized medicine, and when he — and health care. When he talks about a public option, he’s talking about destroying your Medicare —” “Wrong.” “Totally destroyed. And destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. He tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor. They wanted to make it work —” “O.K, let’s hear, let’s let Vice President Biden respond —” “It’s impossible to work — it doesn’t work.” “He’s a very confused guy. He thinks he’s running against somebody else. He’s running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden he’s running against.” “Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4,000 kids. You’ve since reversed your zero-tolerance policy, but the United States can’t locate the parents of more than 500 children. So how will these families ever be reunited?” “Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels. And they’re brought here, and they used to use them to get into our country. We now have as strong a border as we’ve ever had. We’re over 400 miles of brand-new wall. You see the numbers. And we let people in, but they have to come in legally.” “These 500-plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. Big, real tough — we’re really strong. And guess what? They cannot — it’s not, coyotes didn’t bring them over. Their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every notion of who we are as a nation. A black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you’re walking down the street, don’t have a hoodie on when you go across the street. Making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, ‘Yes, sir,’ ‘No, sir,’ hands on top of the wheel. Because you are, in fact, the victim, whether you’re a person making, child of a $300,000-per-year person or someone who’s on food stamps.” “I got criminal justice reform done and prison reform and opportunity zones. I took care of Black colleges and universities. I don’t know what to say. They can say anything. I mean, they can say anything. It’s a very — it makes me sad because I am, I am the least racist person. I can’t even see the audience because it’s so dark, but I don’t care who’s in the audience: I’m the least racist person in this room.” “He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. He started off his campaign coming down the escalator, saying he’s going to get rid of those Mexican ‘rapists.’ He’s banned Muslims because they’re Muslims. He has moved around and made everything worse across the board.” “I have one final question —” “Would he close down the oil industry? Would you close down the oil industry?” “By the way, I would transition from the oil industry, yes.” “Oh, that’s a big statement!” “I would transition — it is a big statement.” “That’s a big statement!” “Because I would stop —” “Why would you do that?” “Because the oil industry pollutes significantly.” “Oh, I see!” “Here’s the deal.” “That’s a big statement.” “But you can’t do that — well, if you let me finish the statement — because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time, over time. And I’d stop giving to the oil industry, I’d stop giving them federal subsidies.” “Ooh!” “He won’t give federal subsidies to the gas, excuse me, to the, to solar and wind.” “Yeah.” “Why are we giving it to oil industry?” “Imagine this is your inauguration day. What will you say in your address to America, to Americans who did not vote for you?” “We have to make our country totally successful as it was prior to the plague coming in from China. Success is going to bring us together. We are on the road to success. But I’m cutting taxes, and he wants to raise everybody’s taxes. And he wants to put new regulations on everything.” “What is on the ballot here is the character of this country. Decency, honor, respect, treating people with dignity, making sure that everyone has an even chance. And I’m going to make sure you get that. You haven’t been getting it the last four years.” President Trump heeded the pleas of his advisers to tone it down during Thursday night’s debate against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., but the two clashed on a series of issues that underscored their vastly different visions for the nation. Mr. Trump did not reflexively interrupt Mr. Biden or talk over the moderator repeatedly. His voice stayed mostly calm. But Mr. Trump unleashed an unrelenting series of false, misleading and exaggerated statements as he sought to distort Mr. Biden’s record and positions and boost his own re-election hopes. The president tried to defend his handling of the pandemic, but Mr. Biden eviscerated him for it. The former vice president, who has called for a return to civility, mocked the president’s claim that people were learning to live with the coronavirus. “We’re dying with it,” Mr. Biden responded after Mr. Trump falsely claimed that spikes in cases in several states had receded. It is a theme Mr. Biden was expected to try to drive home on Friday at a campaign appearance in Delaware, where he will outline his approach to handling the pandemic. Mr. Biden made some false or misleading statements at the debate as well. But Mr. Trump relied more on questionable and specious arguments about Mr. Biden’s family, Democratic policy positions and his own record. Mr. Trump tried to focus attention on the topic that he and his allies have pushed for days: about foreign business deals sought by Mr. Biden’s son Hunter. Mr. Biden said that he himself never took money from foreign countries, and then turned attention back to Mr. Trump’s thick web of business entanglements and conflicts. There was a moment of levity when Mr. Biden, puzzling at a response from Mr. Trump, said, “I don’t know where this guy comes from.” Mr. Trump responded dryly, “Queens.” Though Mr. Biden performed better than he had in their earlier matchup, he was not perfect. During a discussion of energy, Mr. Biden said he would “transition” away from the oil industry, a statement that Republicans are likely to focus on. (After the debate, Mr. Biden stressed that “we’re not getting rid of fossil fuels for a long time.”) Still, with 11 days left until the election and more than 50 million Americans having cast ballots already, a draw or even a modest victory for Mr. Trump might not do much to change the trajectory of the race. And any path to victory for Mr. Trump would likely have to include a win in Florida. So Mr. Trump was scheduled to hold two rallies in the state on Friday before spending the night at Mar-a-Lago. — Maggie Haberman and Linda Qiu A Texas man linked to a far-right, anti-government group was arrested on charges of participating in the destruction of a police precinct in Minneapolis during the protests that erupted there in May, federal authorities announced on Friday. In the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd by the police, a member of the Boogaloo movement opened fire during the protests, according to the F.B.I. The man, Ivan H. Hunter, 26, is accused of firing 13 rounds from a semiautomatic Kalashnikov-style rifle into the Third Precinct building of the Minneapolis Police Department. After firing the weapon, the complaint said, video footage from the incident shows a man identified as Mr. Hunter high-fiving another person and yelling, “Justice for Floyd!” He also later bragged about fomenting violence on social media, it said. Having traveled from Texas specifically to participate in the demonstration, he later wrote on Facebook, “I didn’t’ protest peacefully Dude … Want something to change? Start risking felonies for what is good,” according to the complaint from the F.B.I.’s counterterrorism unit in Minneapolis. He faces a rioting charge, a felony, Erica H. MacDonald, the U.S. attorney for Minnesota, announced on Friday. Mr. Hunter left Minneapolis soon after the May 28 incident to return to Austin, Texas, where, during a traffic stop a few days later, law enforcement officials noticed a distinct magazine on his rifle that was later linked to the shooting, the complaint said. At the time of the incident, police had abandoned the building but looters remained inside, it said. In addition, Mr. Hunter was in contact on social media with Steven Carrillo, the Air Force sergeant charged in California with the shooting death of two law enforcement officers, a federal officer at the Oakland Court House on May 29 and a sheriff’s deputy during the June 6 shootout that lead to his arrest. Mr. Carrillo and Mr. Hunter encouraged each other, the complaint said. Both declared themselves members of the so-called Boogaloo Bois, a loosely-affiliated group opposed to the government and seeking to accelerate a second civil war. Mr. Hunter told the police that he was in charge of the group’s activities in southern Texas, the complaint said. President Trump has repeatedly blamed the violence that erupted during the social justice protests in Minneapolis on “radical leftists,” particularly antifa, but that claim is unsubstantiated; antifa is a loose movement, not an organized group. The arrest comes as both federal and local law enforcement agencies have warned about possible violence surrounding the election from armed, illegal paramilitary groups. Earlier this week, federal authorities announced the arrest of a man on accusations that he made violent threats against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic candidate, and 14 men have been charged for their alleged involvement in a plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan and other anti-government violence. — Neil MacFarquhar AD WATCH A new radio ad from the Democratic National Committee further amplifies the party’s get-out-the-vote message in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania — with the voice of Leslie Odom Jr., best known for his performance as Aaron Burr in the original cast of the Broadway musical “Hamilton,” singing about secrecy envelopes to the tune of Stevie Wonder’s hit “Signed, Sealed, Delivered I’m Yours.” Mr. Odom is perhaps the only person who can turn instructions about using a secrecy envelope into a catchy jingle. But the lyrics — “Use your secrecy en-ve-looope. Double seal it to protect your voooote.” — are intended to remind Pennsylvanians how to correctly vote by mail. The radio ad includes a whole suite of instructions: A voter must fill the ballot out and place it inside a small envelope known as a “secrecy envelope,” seal that, and place it into a larger return envelope. That envelope is then signed, sealed, and, yes, delivered once the voter puts it in the mail, drops it off at a local county elections office or puts it in a drop box. Failure to use the secrecy envelope will leave the ballot “naked,” and the state will disqualify it, a wild card in the election that has Democrats — who are more likely to vote by mail than Republicans — losing sleep. The ad is more instructive than heavy on facts, but these are indeed the steps Pennsylvania requires for mail ballots. The ad is running in Philadelphia and across the state, on the radio and on digital radio outlets, including Pandora. In the closing stretch of the campaign, Democrats have been laser-focused on getting out the vote. The effort has taken on heightened urgency during the pandemic, and the party is spending heavily to reach voters who are heading to polls early or casting their ballots by mail. In Pennsylvania, Democrats are especially concerned that voters will forget to place their ballots in the secrecy envelopes, resulting in naked ballots that officials have been instructed to toss out. — Sydney Ember In an attack on Joseph R. Biden’s environmental platform during the debate on Thursday, President Trump invoked the policies of four other politicians. “If you look at his plan, his environmental plan, you know who developed it?” Mr. Trump said. “A.O.C. plus three. They know nothing about the climate.” Mr. Trump seemed to be referring to four Democratic congresswomen of color whom he has repeatedly singled out for attacks: Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. The congresswomen were quick to respond on social media. “It’s actually AOC plus 115,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a tweet, “because that’s how many House and Senate members have co-sponsored the most ambitious climate legislation in American history.” She was referring to the Green New Deal, a proposal she introduced with Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts last year. It calls on the federal government to wean the United States from fossil fuels and curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions; it also aims to guarantee new high-paying jobs in clean energy industries. All four congresswomen responded to Mr. Trump on Twitter, as did many of their supporters. Living in his head rent free is something.https://t.co/8wZi9JrRsE pic.twitter.com/Mimw04BOel If someone told me 3 years ago, while I was waitressing to help my family stay afloat, that in a few short years an unhinged President of the United States would be repeatedly saying my name at the 2020 debate, I would’ve brought them some water and told them to sober up. “AOC +3? Hate to break it to you, but it’s about to be a lot more than 3,” wrote Cori Bush, an activist in St. Louis, Mo., who toppled a veteran Democratic congressman in an August primary and is likely headed to the House of Representatives. Mr. Biden has said that he does not support the Green New Deal, but his website calls it a “crucial framework.” Mr. Trump has repeatedly tried to convince voters that Mr. Biden is either a secret socialist or a liberal pawn, and he has often zeroed in on Ms. Ocasio-Cortez as a symbol of the progressive left. “If we’ve been identified as public enemy #1 to the worst president in modern history and an entire party of his sycophants,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a tweet on Friday, “then we must be doing something right.” — Jacey Fortin Senator Susan Collins of Maine — the only Republican senator on the ballot this year who has not endorsed President Trump — could be in for the fight of her political life. The four-term senator has become a national punchline among liberals for what they see as her toothless tut-tutting of the president, whom she is invariably “concerned” about. She has alienated Democrats in Maine and beyond by voting to confirm Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. And she’s been out-raised $63 million to $25 million by her Democratic opponent, Sara Gideon, the speaker of the State House. Ms. Collins’s biggest problem this year, however, may not be Ms. Gideon or the out-of-state donors eager to send her a message, but rather the shifting ground under her feet. She is confronting a state, sharply cleaved by region and class, that would have been politically unrecognizable to her predecessors; an increasingly alien party overtaken by a president who demands unflinching loyalty; and, perhaps most daunting of all, a polarized political culture that elevates tribalism and national issues over the bipartisanship and pork-barreling that she has always pursued. Ms. Collins argues that there are exceptions to this era of polarization, and that well-known lawmakers in lightly populated states can overcome the partisan tide. Senators Jon Tester of Montana and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, for example, both won as Democrats in Republican-leaning states just two years ago. “There’s a lot of parallels,” Ms. Collins said in an interview on her campaign bus. “I still believe that most voters want problems solved and that they’re put off by this us-against-them tribalism.” Polls in recent weeks have shown Ms. Collins trailing Ms. Gideon, but not by much, and sometimes within the margin of error. But survey results released last week by Pan Atlantic Research showed Ms. Gideon ahead by 7.1 percentage points. The margin of sampling error for the poll, which was conducted from Oct. 2 to 6, was 4.5 percentage points. — Jonathan Martin and Jacey Fortin THE TV WATCH If you listened to President Trump debate Joseph R. Biden Jr. Thursday, you may have felt like you’d started watching a complicated serial drama — “Lost” or “Twin Peaks” — in its final season. The president kept dropping names and plot points, all seeming to reference a baroque mythology. Who was “the big man?” What was “the laptop?” How many seasons of this show did I miss? This impression is not far off. The soap opera whose story lines and catchphrases Mr. Trump was quoting was Fox News, his favorite binge-watch. And increasingly, he speaks less like a president to Americans than as a Fox superfan to other superfans. For those steeped in conservative media, the “laptop” reference alludes to questionable accusations of corrupt business practices by Mr. Biden’s son Hunter, unverified in other media but pored over lately on Mr. Trump’s favorite shows. “A.O.C. plus three” was not algebra but a dismissive nickname for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and three of her progressive peers in Congress. A reference to selling “pillows and sheets” apparently revived an old conservative criticism of support to Ukraine during the Obama administration, not a Biden home-furnishings line. These impenetrable word clouds not only blunted his attacks but showed how Fox can be as much a blinder for the president as an asset. Mr. Trump has become so immersed in the conservative mediasphere that his language became a referential fog that seemed to require an explanatory fan podcast. All this may have signaled solidarity to Mr. Trump’s fellow Fox News junkies. But if you weren’t a longtime watcher, this show was not made for you. — James Poniewozik Republicans hold a narrow lead up and down the ballot in Montana, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll Friday, as Democrats remain highly competitive in a state President Trump won by 20 points in 2016. Overall, Mr. Trump leads Joseph R. Biden Jr. by six points, 49 percent to 43 percent, echoing favorable results for Mr. Biden in Times/Siena surveys of relatively white states across Northern battlegrounds. But in the hotly contested race for U.S. Senate, the Republican senator Steve Daines narrowly leads Gov. Steve Bullock, 49 percent to 46 percent. The survey was conducted from Oct. 18 to 20, before the final presidential debate on Thursday. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. Republicans also hold modest four-point leads in the races for U.S. House and governor. In a reversal from the Times/Siena poll in September, the Republican Matt Rosendale leads the Democrat Kathleen Williams, 50 percent to 46 percent, for Montana’s at-large House seat.  The sitting House representative, Greg Gianforte, leads the Democrat Mike Cooney by four points as well, 48-44, in the state’s race for governor. The poll results are stronger than expected for Democrats in many respects, except perhaps in the race they care about most: the campaign for Senate. In the close battle for Senate control in Washington, Montana emerged as one of the best Democratic opportunities to flip a seat after the Democrats recruited Mr. Bullock, who won re-election for governor in 2016 even as the same voters backed Mr. Trump. But the poll shows him narrowly trailing Mr. Daines, although the race is still within the margin of error. — Nate Cohn President Trump’s re-election campaign entered the final stretch with $109 million less in the bank than Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s effort, according to federal election disclosures filed on Thursday. As of Oct. 14, Mr. Biden’s campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the joint fund-raising committees they share had more than $331 million available, compared to $222 million for the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and their affiliated fund-raising committees. Mr. Trump’s small-dollar fund-raising committee struggled with costs in October, bringing in $36 million while spending $32 million on expenses, including digital advertising and direct mailings. Over all, Mr. Trump and the  Republican National Committee raised $108 million in the first two weeks of the month. In the same time period, Mr. Biden’s committees raised $162 million and spent $218 million. The bulk of the Biden campaign’s spending during that time was on advertising, shelling out $83 million for television ads and an additional $43 million online. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
