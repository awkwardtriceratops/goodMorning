The patchwork of in-person and virtual schooling is making things worse. By Aaricka Washington Ms. Washington is an education reporter. I’m going to be honest: I didn’t know what I was doing. There I was, a 22-year-old standing at the front of a classroom of lower-income elementary students in southwest Houston with only one month of training and an undergraduate degree in journalism. But I was a young, Black woman and in interviews I had shown a clear passion for helping Black and brown children succeed — which made me a Teach for America darling. And I felt somewhat anchored by Doug Lemov’s “Teach Like a Champion” books, a manual championed by many education reformers, which offered techniques for gaining the compliance of every student in the classroom. I just had to follow its “rules of classroom management.” In the early months, nothing made me happier than when my students stood in a straight line with their hands behind their back. This rigid leadership was intended to help them close the achievement gap. But moments of full compliance were fleeting, and suspensions were commonplace. When I sent one of my brightest second-grade boys to the office after a fight, he ended up suspended and came back days later a different child. He left the school soon afterward. The problem, I learned, was that discipline and punishment came before relationship building. Students and educators are beginning the school year this fall under unheard-of circumstances as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. And I am gripped by the fear that aggressive school discipline is only going to get worse. Some cases of harsh disciplinary actions have already made news. In May, a Michigan judge sent a 15 year-old Black girl with a learning disability in to a juvenile detention center because she did not do her homework, a violation of her probation. In Sacramento, Calif., a rising fourth-grader’s email privileges were briefly suspended after she was accused of having “bombarded the district’s tech support department with requests.” In this moment of crisis, rather than reflexively devolving into punitive tactics, educators can radically shift their mind- set on classroom behavior and particularly how they treat marginalized students. Subini Annamma, an associate professor at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Education, is doing research on students who have been suspended from the San Francisco Unified School District to ask them about their experiences.
