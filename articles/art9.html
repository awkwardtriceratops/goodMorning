Like the river, she will have to be strong. By Sônia Guajajara Ms. Guajajara is an Indigenous activist. MARANHÃO STATE, Brazil — My daughter, Y’Wara, is 15. Last September she became a woman in the Menina Moça ceremony, which our tribe, the Guajajara, has performed for centuries. The men go into the forest to hunt up to two months before the ceremony. They bring back animals we consider sacred, like the tinamou — a quick, ground-dwelling bird whose call sounds like a whistle. And they also hunt for monkeys, wild pigs and the large rodents called pacas that will be made into a stew to serve to the elders of our community, the girls, and those closest to them the morning after the party. For at least a month, the carcasses are laid out and smoked to conserve the meat.
