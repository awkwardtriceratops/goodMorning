By Annie Karni and Thomas Kaplan President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. will appear on Thursday at separate, nationally televised town hall events starting at 8 p.m. Eastern. Mr. Trump will be taking questions from voters in Miami. NBC, MSNBC and CNBC will broadcast the town hall, which will be moderated by the “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie. It is expected to last for about an hour. ABC will carry the Biden town hall, to be held at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia and moderated by ABC News’s chief anchor, George Stephanopoulos. The event is expected to last 90 minutes. Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden were originally scheduled to hold a debate on Thursday night, but it was canceled after the president bowed out because it was set to be held virtually. A federal judge in Pennsylvania last week threw out a lawsuit by the Trump campaign that sought to limit how mail-in ballots can be collected and counted. Facebook and Twitter on Wednesday said they were limiting the distribution of, or simply blocking, a report in The New York Post that made unverified claims about Mr. Biden. The stimulus bill Mr. Trump is pushing for is at odds with both parties on Capitol Hill. With under three weeks to go, Mr. Trump has a host of targets he can point to as he looks to explain why things aren’t going his way. Where he focuses his anger will also provide a preview of how he may react to the results on election night, if he loses.
