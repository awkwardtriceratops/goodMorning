By Ruth Graham Jerry Falwell Jr. is suing his former employer, Liberty University, accusing the evangelical college of damaging his reputation in a series of actions taken after his dramatic departure from the school in August. The suit depicts Mr. Falwell and his family as victims of “a malicious smear campaign incited by anti-evangelical forces.” It accuses Liberty of helping to spread “outrageous lies” about him, and “playing right into the hands of sinister operatives with ulterior motives.” The lawsuit was filed in a state court in Lynchburg, Va., on Wednesday. The 29-page complaint includes claims of defamation and breach of contract, and requests a trial by jury. It asks for damages but does not name a specific amount. Mr. Falwell said in August he had walked away with a severance package worth $10.5 million when he resigned. The university has said Mr. Falwell’s severance compensation was dictated by the terms of his pre-existing employment agreement. Mr. Falwell assumed leadership of the school in 2007 upon the death of his father, the pastor and political influencer Jerry Falwell, who founded the school in 1971. The school had struggled financially under its founder, but his son built the small Baptist college into a powerhouse evangelical institution with an endowment of $1.6 billion. Mr. Falwell’s early and full-throated support of Donald J. Trump propelled him into the national spotlight. The suit arrives at a fraught moment for the university. Members of its 32-member board arrived in Lynchburg on Wednesday for its first in-person meeting since Mr. Falwell’s departure. The meeting, which is scheduled to last through Friday, is an unusually long one for a board accustomed to briefer meetings just twice a year. The board has retained an independent forensic accounting firm, Baker Tilly US, to investigate the school’s operations under Mr. Falwell. The suit also arrives just days before a national election whose results could begin to reshape the reputation of a university that became an institutional center of Trumpism under Mr. Falwell’s leadership. The suit revives the tawdry scandal that led to Mr. Falwell’s departure from the school in August. Mr. Falwell issued a statement on Aug. 23 announcing that his wife, Becki, had engaged in an affair with a pool attendant the couple met at a luxury hotel in Miami. That man, Giancarlo Granda, went public the next day with his own account of the relationship, saying that Mr. Falwell participated by observing their sexual liaisons. Mr. Falwell has accused Mr. Granda of attempted extortion, and has denied his participation. Mr. Falwell was already on indefinite leave from Liberty by this point, having posted a photograph to Instagram that depicted him holding a glass of dark liquid, with his pants partially unzipped and arm wrapped around his wife’s assistant. The photograph, which was quickly deleted, was taken during a family vacation on a yacht owned by a prominent Liberty supporter. The school’s board accepted Mr. Falwell’s resignation on Aug. 25. Jerry Prevo, a retired Alaska megachurch pastor and Liberty board member, has been serving as the school’s acting president since Mr. Falwell’s leave. The suit on Thursday alleges that after the disputed details of Ms. Falwell’s relationship with Mr. Granda were public, Liberty “moved quickly to destroy Mr. Falwell’s reputation in the Liberty community and nationwide.” In particular, the suit highlights a speech the campus pastor, David Nasser, delivered to students shortly after Mr. Falwell’s departure. Mr. Nasser referred to “the things that led to” Mr. Falwell’s resignation as “sinful behavior” and “shameful,” and the suit characterizes the talk as defamatory.
