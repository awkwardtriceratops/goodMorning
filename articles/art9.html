By Jeremy W. Peters and Isabella Grullón Paz Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by eight points in Michigan, a battleground state that Mr. Trump flipped in 2016. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of 856 likely voters in Michigan from Oct. 23 to Oct. 26. Joseph R. Biden Jr. is leading President Trump by eight percentage points in Michigan, according to a new poll from The New York Times and Siena College on Wednesday, the latest survey to show Mr. Trump’s troubled standing in Midwestern battleground states as white voters without college degrees, his political bulwark, turn away from him. Four years ago, Michigan provided one of Mr. Trump’s most surprising victories and helped him barrel through the so-called blue wall of Northern industrial states that had favored Democrats in presidential elections since the 1990s. This year, Michigan is trending with those states again, but in the wrong direction for Mr. Trump’s hopes of re-election. Mr. Biden, the Democratic nominee, had the support of 49 percent of likely voters in the poll, and Mr. Trump was at 41 percent, virtually unchanged from a Times/Siena survey of Michigan two weeks ago. Recent polls have shown Mr. Trump trailing Mr. Biden in Wisconsin by similar or even larger margins. Mr. Trump is also behind in Pennsylvania, though polls have shown that race tightening somewhat recently and he held three rallies in the state on Monday, a sign his campaign believes it is within reach. Mr. Biden will win the election if he captures Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and hangs onto the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016. The results in Michigan also indicated a tough race for the Republican Senate candidate, John James, a 39-year-old Black Army combat veteran who has benefited from a surge of donations and support from the national party and its allies. Despite Republicans’ optimism about pulling off an upset against Senator Gary Peters, a first-term incumbent, the poll showed the Senate race aligned with the presidential contest: Mr. Peters led, 49 percent to 41 percent. That was a better showing for Mr. Peters than in the Times/Siena poll two weeks ago, when he led by only one point. The Democratic Senate incumbent Gary Peters has opened a lead over his Republican challenger, John James, in Michigan. Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of 856 likely voters in Michigan from Oct. 23 to Oct. 26. Over all, Mr. Trump’s popularity has taken a serious hit with the coalition of white voters — independents, those who had an unfavorable view of him but supported him anyway, people with and without college educations — that helped him inch to victory in Michigan in 2016. He won by fewer than 11,000 votes, or 0.2 percentage points, his thinnest margin of any state. Four years ago, exit polls showed that he carried narrow majorities of independents and white college graduates, while winning a commanding majority of white voters without college degrees. Half of his voters said they did not have a favorable impression of him.
