By Nicole Hong and Sean Piccoli Keith Raniere promised a path to happiness, seducing wealthy people who felt they lacked a higher purpose in life. His company, Nxivm, offered self-improvement workshops that became popular in Hollywood and business circles. But beneath the surface, Mr. Raniere was a puppet master controlling a cultlike criminal enterprise, prosecutors revealed at his trial. Some women in Nxivm were sexually abused by Mr. Raniere, and even branded with his initials in a secret ceremony. On Tuesday, Mr. Raniere, 60, was sentenced to 120 years, effectively life, in prison for sex trafficking and other crimes. The sentencing, in federal court in Brooklyn, followed hours of often wrenching testimony from 15 victims, many of whom described how Mr. Raniere had left them traumatized and struggling to make themselves whole again. The first to speak was a witness identified only as Camila, who in a trembling voice recalled the precise date that she was sexually abused by Mr. Raniere: Sept. 18, 2005. She was 15, and he was 45. He insisted, she said, that they both recognize the date as their anniversary. The relationship lasted 12 years, Camila said, with Mr. Raniere expecting her to be available for sex at all hours. He ordered her to weigh less than 100 pounds and directed her to get an abortion. She said she attempted suicide once. “I want to move on, but he has damaged me in so many ways,” said Camila, who added that she was still having trouble figuring out the line between an abusive and a normal relationship. Camila’s mother, brother and a sister also spoke on Tuesday, telling the judge that Mr. Raniere destroyed their once close-knit family. The father and oldest daughter in the family — who had a child with Mr. Raniere — are still supporters of him. Mr. Raniere had a sexual relationship with all three sisters in the family.
