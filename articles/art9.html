By Megan Thee Stallion Megan Thee Stallion is an entertainer, philanthropist and entrepreneur. TRANSCRIPT What does it mean to be a woman of color? [INTERPOSING VOICES] She’s got to be strong, because that’s just the expectation. Loving herself, but not too much, because then she’s conceited. Being his lady in the street, but his freak in the sheets. Inheriting her grandmother’s love, but always loving the wrong one. Twerking for her man, but not with her friends? Being constantly told she’s too much or not enough. “The most disrespected person is the black woman.” Constantly having to prove she’s a victim, because society sides with a man. Not being able to express her traumas, because she can’t show no weakness. Is constantly told that she’s too dark, too thin, too thick, too much of a bitch. Being murdered, beaten, abused, then questioned if she evoked all of it. Is left out on the street, but becomes the flower that grows from the concrete. “Who taught you to hate yourself from the top of your head to the soles of your feet?” She marches for everyone else, riots for everyone else, dies for everyone else. She loves for everyone else, lives for everyone else, but when it comes down to her, it ain’t a [BLEEP] in sight. “The system as a whole has failed her. You’ve never been shot. You don’t know her panic. Say her name. 18. Women of color.” In the weeks leading up to the election, Black women are expected once again to deliver victory for Democratic candidates. We have gone from being unable to vote legally to a highly courted voting bloc — all in little more than a century. Despite this and despite the way so many have embraced messages about racial justice this year, Black women are still constantly disrespected and disregarded in so many areas of life. I was recently the victim of an act of violence by a man. After a party, I was shot twice as I walked away from him. We were not in a relationship. Truthfully, I was shocked that I ended up in that place. My initial silence about what happened was out of fear for myself and my friends. Even as a victim, I have been met with skepticism and judgment. The way people have publicly questioned and debated whether I played a role in my own violent assault proves that my fears about discussing what happened were, unfortunately, warranted.
