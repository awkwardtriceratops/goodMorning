It happens to be one of the assets he and his wife are disputing in lawsuits over their divorce. By Alexandra Alter Ever since his breakout with “The Da Vinci Code,” the novelist Dan Brown has been renowned for his twisty, adrenaline-fueled yet cerebral plots involving cryptography, symbology, smart and sexy lady sidekicks, secret and violent religious cults, and unhinged zealots bent on mass murder and destruction. His new book, on the other hand, features a mouse conductor who recruits a menagerie of animals to perform in an orchestra, while delivering proverbs about the virtues of fortitude, patience and cooperation. (Its target audience is children ages 3 to 7.) It will be released this week alongside a classical music album for children, called “Wild Symphony,” that was composed by Mr. Brown and based on songs he self-produced some 30 years ago, back when he was an aspiring musician in his 20s — long before he had published any novels. At that time, Mr. Brown, who is now 56, recorded the songs using synthesizers in his tiny studio. He made about 500 cassettes (and booklets of poetry) and sold them on consignment at his local bookstore. The newly released album features updated versions of the original songs along with new ones, all performed and recorded by the Zagreb Festival Orchestra in Croatia. It’s an unexpected professional detour after Mr. Brown’s seven thrillers, which collectively have more than 234 million copies in print, and have made him a multimillionaire. “Wild Symphony” is also, somewhat awkwardly, an unexpected item of contention in a messy legal battle between Mr. Brown and his ex-wife, Blythe Brown, after their divorce last year. In a complaint filed this summer, Ms. Brown claimed that her former husband misrepresented their assets during the divorce proceedings, and lists “Wild Symphony” as one of several projects that she claims he failed to disclose when they separated. She also alleged that he led “a secret life” for years, hiding an affair with a Dutch horse trainer and concealing lavish purchases he made for his mistress, including two Friesian horses, one of them named Da Vinci. (The other horse was a “highly coveted, prizewinning Friesian” black stallion named “Limited Edition” that cost $345,000, according to her complaint.) Mr. Brown filed a countersuit for libel and slander, among other claims, on July 30, arguing that his former wife set out to “publicly shame him” and “destroy his legacy.”
