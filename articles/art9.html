Now I Am Emboldened.’<br></h1><p id="artcont">Readers share their thoughts and condolences after the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. By Rachel L. Harris and Lisa Tarchak Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants. Since the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday, readers have used the comments sections of Opinion pieces to express not only their grief, but also their anger and fear about what her loss means for the future of the Supreme Court, the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and Democratic ideals in general. “It feels like the end of justice,” wrote M.K. in Germany. Marika H. in Santa Monica, Calif., wrote, “Our already-fragile democracy should have never depended on a single heartbeat.” For Jeffrey Freedman in New York, the political implications could wait. “It is just a few hours since we learned about her death and a good percentage of the news is about replacing her,” he wrote Friday night. “I think we’ve lost something when we cannot spend even one day focused on mourning the loss of a very special American who was beloved by many.” More comments from our readers follow. They have been edited for length and clarity.
