By Juliana Kim A small plane piloted by Stephen E. Barnes, a former partner in one of the most well-known personal injury law firms in the country, crashed in upstate New York on Friday morning, killing him and a passenger, a lawyer with knowledge of the matter said. The single-engine plane went down in a wooded area near Pembroke, N.Y., about 32 miles east of Buffalo, Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said. Only two people — Mr. Barnes and his niece — were on the board the plane, the lawyer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for the Barnes family. Mr. Barnes was 61, his niece, Elizabeth Barnes, was in her late 20s. Residents saw the plane, which was traveling from east to west, go down at 11:46 a.m. and explode in some woods near Boyce Road, the Genesee County sheriff, William A. Sheron Jr., said in a statement. He confirmed that a man and a woman had died, but did not immediately identify them. The plane, a TBM 700 aircraft that can carry up to seven people, left New Hampshire around 10:18 a.m. and was supposed to land in Buffalo less than two hours later, Sheriff Sheron said.
