By Richard Fausset, Rick Rojas and Will Wright PENSACOLA, Fla. — After the deluge brought by Hurricane Sally slowed and the powerful winds of what had been a Category 2 storm passed, many on the Gulf Coast were beginning on Thursday to see just how much devastation the storm had left behind. Entire neighborhoods were left waterlogged, with a combination of storm surge and record precipitation having caused floods that reached higher than five feet. Rescuers had pulled families from homes and cars. Docks had been destroyed, sending captains chasing after boats, trying to tie them down to whatever they could. At least one death has been attributed to the storm. “It’s just obviously been a very historic flood event here,” said Laura Coale, a spokeswoman for the Escambia County government, a jurisdiction that includes Pensacola, the largest city on the western end of the Florida panhandle. “Downtown is really flooded.” Sally was defined by its erratic nature and slow speed, churning in the Gulf of Mexico at just 2 miles per hour before making landfall on Wednesday morning near Gulf Shores, Ala. The storm moved almost as slowly as it raked over land, leaving residents to hunker down for hours as they waited for it to pass. The storm has released torrents of rain on the Gulf Coast. When many began to emerge later Wednesday, they saw that the storm had ravaged a stretch of coast around the Alabama and Florida border with an intensity that few had anticipated. The authorities said nearly 400 people had been rescued from the floodwaters by afternoon. Homes and businesses had been ransacked by wind and water. A major bridge crossing the Pensacola Bay had a section knocked out by the storm. Many roadways were impassable because of accumulated water or blockades of fallen trees and debris. Barges had become unmoored and, according to The Associated Press, a replica of the Nina, one of Christopher Columbus’s ships, had vanished from its dock on the Pensacola waterfront. Local officials said they had been surprised by a last-minute forecast that showed the storm shifting in their direction, after having been expected to make landfall farther west. But they swatted aside claims that they had not been ready. “Escambia is never unprepared,” David Morgan, the Escambia County sheriff, said during a briefing on Wednesday afternoon. “If there’s a hurricane tonight, we’re prepared to address that. If there’s a riot tonight, we’re prepared to address that.” Still, the authorities urged residents to stay put if they could, warning of the multitude of dangers that come in the aftermath of a storm. Even as the storm surge recedes along the coast, at least eight rivers are expected to see major flood events into Thursday, raising water levels by several feet. Steve Miller, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said that smaller rivers would be especially susceptible to rapid changes in water level, and that communities along the banks of those rivers could be at increased risk as late as Thursday afternoon. Ms. Coale said the county was urging people to abide by a nightly curfew, especially since roadways were crisscrossed with downed power lines that made driving in the dark particularly dangerous. The county had no estimate of the number of structures damaged by the storm, but Ms. Coale said the damage was widespread.
