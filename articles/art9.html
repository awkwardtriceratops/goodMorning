Even the Oyster Bar Can’t Survive.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Since March, 77 of the 321 retail businesses still operating in the subway system have permanently closed, according to the transit agency. By Christina Goldbaum Even as trains sat mostly empty and silence filled Vanderbilt Hall, for one day it felt like a time capsule in a corner of Grand Central Terminal: The station’s famed Oyster Bar, which had shuttered for seven months because of pandemic restrictions, had reopened and 80 of its 81 reservations slots were filled. Inside bartenders sloshed cocktails, shuckers pried open shells and regulars slid onto leather chairs in a scene familiar since the restaurant opened in 1913. But the liveliness was fleeting. As days passed, the flood of customers dwindled to a trickle. Then, only two weeks after the restaurant reopened, it closed. For over a century, the New York City subway has served as the backbone of the city’s economy, shuttling riders to workplaces and tourists to famed sightseeing spots. At the same time, the system spawned its own economic ecosystem of businesses sustained by the millions of people traipsing through stations every day. But when the pandemic decimated ridership, those establishments lost almost all their customers, dealing a blow at least as devastating, if not worse, as the pain the outbreak has inflicted on businesses above ground. The number of transit-linked businesses, from newsstands and hot dog vendors to florists and shoe shiners, had already been in steady decline as print newspapers lost favor and tighter regulations meant to make the subway system cleaner and less cluttered shut down stores. Now the prolonged period of low ridership has made the situation even worse. Since March, 77 of the 321 retail businesses still operating in the system have permanently closed, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city’s subway. “How do we survive?” said Jairo Cardenas, 62, a cobbler who runs a shoe shine shop along the Eighth Avenue stretch of the Times Square station, typically one of the system’s busiest stops. “We don’t have tourists, people are all working from home. We have nothing.” At the Oyster Bar, Sandy Ingber, the executive chef and a co-owner, was optimistic during the initial rush of old customers excited to finally visit. But within days, the flurry of reservations dried up. As dinners dwindled, the staff did too. First to be let go were the waiters, then some cooks. Mr. Ingber fought to keep his last shucker — it is an oyster bar after all — but soon even he was laid off. “It’s just not sustainable,” Mr. Ingber, 66, said.  “Until we have more foot traffic in Grand Central we just can’t do it.” He is not sure when the restaurant might reopen. “People are very worried about going into restaurants indoors, much less going into a train station,” he said. In an effort to keep remaining shops open, the transit agency adopted a plan last week to offer long-term rent relief, adjusting rents to reflect current sales until business returns to normal. “We want to make sure when the system comes back, we haven’t lost all the amenities for our customers,” said Janno Lieber, the head of the authority’s capital construction. Still, some shop owners say with subway ridership at just 30 percent of normal levels — and unlikely to rebound to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon as more businesses keep their workers home — rent relief may not be enough to keep them afloat. “Without people coming back to offices, we are dead,” said Dominick Abruscato, 72, who owns the Royal Barber Shop at the Fulton Street station in Lower Manhattan. Since 1937, business executives and other workers have sought out this unassuming corner of the station for a haircut. In recent years, many have come specifically to see Mr. Abruscato, an Italian immigrant who began cutting hair when he was 8, turned professional when he was 14 and began working in the shop 40 years ago. “I don’t even have hair anymore and I wouldn’t go elsewhere,” said the shop’s lone client, John Silverman, 71, as he sat in Mr. Abruscato’s barber chair one recent afternoon. Like all other nonessential businesses in the city, the shop closed for three months this spring during New York’s initial lockdown. The first three days after he reopened in June were hectic, Mr. Abruscato said. Around 45 clients booked appointments each day. But after that, the cascade of daily customers slowed to two or three. “I’m trying,” he said. “I’m trying to stick around, but I don’t know what’s going to happen.” Farther north at the Times Square station — the system’s de facto town square where nine lines intersect — the owner of a women’s clothing store, Backwoods, said revenues had not reached more than 25 percent of normal levels at the store. “When 42nd Street reopened it was really depressing,” said the owner, John Ruesch, 63. “You work really hard for 30 years to build a business and then all of a sudden there are no customers.” But in a reflection of how the pandemic has changed riding trends — emptying usually packed Manhattan stations, while pushing ridership higher in other boroughs where essential workers tend to live —  his store’s second branch in the Jackson Heights-Roosevelt Avenue/74th Street station in Queens is faring far better. That store is making about half its usual revenue and may help both shops survive. Even iconic stalwarts have not been spared from the financial free-fall. Down a long corridor from Backwoods, Record Mart — which sold vinyls and sound equipment — had been a fixture in the station for half a century. But in recent years its owner, Lou Moskowitz, had watched as the bank across the mezzanine closed and his record sales eroded as most retail moved online. The pandemic felt like a catalyst for an inevitable end. At the beginning of June, the store closed permanently. “Things are just so different now, it’s hard to have a record store in the subway moving forward,” said Mr. Moskowitz, 53, who took over the shop from his father 14 years ago. “And I just knew that no one is going to be using the subway, so it wouldn’t pay to reopen.” News of the store’s closure felt like a death knell for riders who could recall when stores like the Record Mart were at their peak. When the city took over the privately operated subway lines in 1940, a transit system that had shuttled shoppers to stores on the streets suddenly offered retailers an opportunity to sell to them before they left the station. During the 1960s, over 170 newsstands catered to riders’ reading desires for their morning commute. Workers purchased flowers on their way home. And hundreds of stores selling everything from candy to schoolchildren to panty hoses to working women found their niche among the steady stream of riders. But the heyday did not last long. After trash-conscious transit officials cracked down on subway food stands in the 1980s and the proliferation of smartphones replaced newspapers at the turn of the century, many of those shops vanished. By the early 1990s, there were just 50 newsstands. Today most stand empty on subway platforms, entombed in metal security gates. “I suspect part of it was economic,” said Joe Cunningham, a subway historian, explaining the decline. “That and cleaning up the subway were the main drivers.” The M.T.A. has made a push in recent years to revamp empty retail spaces to make the system more appealing to riders and also produce some money for the system: last year, retail real estate generated around $60 million in revenue — down from around $80 million the year before, transit officials say. The transit agency has announced plans for new pop-up shops and high-tech vending machines, and has tried to lure developers with offers to overhaul entire mezzanines in major stations. The first such venture opened at the 59th Street-Columbus Circle station, where an empty corridor was transformed into a mini mall known as the Turnstyle Underground Market, complete with a doughnut stand, paella restaurant and a soap store selling bath bombs. “We’re in a time when people want to move quickly in and out of public spaces,” said Mr. Lieber, who is leading the initiative. “People may want their path of travel to give them the convenience retail they need.” The authority is hoping to overhaul the two mezzanines in Times Square station, where empty shops are plastered with bright blue posters advertising the space to developers. Mr. Cardenas, the cobbler at the station, looks at the posters quizzically when he opens his store. Even before the pandemic, the flashy signs reminded him that his time in the station was probably limited. These days, the message feels even more prescient. Before the pandemic, around 80 people a day would stop in his cramped store, where the smell of leather cleaner hangs in the air. But in recent weeks, he says he is lucky if 10 people stop in. He has laid off three of his four employees. “It’s terrible, the business is so, so terrible,” he said. “Every day, the business is getting killed.” </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
