By Marie Fazio A minor earthquake rumbled through parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island on Sunday morning, according to the United States Geological Survey. The earthquake had a preliminary magnitude of 4.0, the Geological Survey said. The earthquake, which happened around 9:10 a.m., had its epicenter at Buzzards Bay, Mass., which is about 50 miles east of Providence, R.I. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Preliminary reports to the Geological Survey suggested it was felt as far away as the Long Island Sound, said Paul Caruso, a geophysicist at the agency. “We wouldn’t expect there to be significant damage from this earthquake,” Mr. Caruso said. “Earthquakes in this area are commonly felt very far away because the rocks in this area are very contiguous, very old, so they transmit the energy very well from earthquakes.” There have been 26 earthquakes in Southern New England since 1963, he said, but this was one of the largest. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
