It also made 2020 an ideal opportunity for those who wanted to cheat. By Matthew Futterman The numbers alone tell a disturbing story. During the first nine months of 2019, antidoping organizations collected more than 231,000 blood and urine samples from athletes for testing for performance-enhancing drugs. During the same period in 2020, with the coronavirus making collection a high-risk event, antidoping organizations collected about 111,000 samples. In April alone, when cities and countries around the world were locked down, only 576 samples were collected, compared with 25,219 for the same month the previous year. As the coronavirus pandemic has swept around the world, killing more than 1.1 million people as of Friday, it has caused lengthy lockdowns and untold economic hardship. But those same restrictions have also significantly reduced the ability of antidoping officials to collect biological samples, and that, experts said, has created a ripe opportunity for cheating as close monitoring of thousands of athletes before the Tokyo Games this summer is expected to begin. “That is a constant worry, even when there are no COVID-related issues,” said Dick Pound, the founding president of the World Antidoping Agency. “It’s more concerning now.” With winter sports that are considered high risk for doping about to begin their World Cup seasons and the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics only eight months away, antidoping officials say the need to get testing back to previous levels is critical. This is particularly essential at competitions, they say, since those offer the best chance — given current travel restrictions — to catch athletes using illegal stimulants that have an immediate effect on performance. “It would be naïve for us to think people have not taken advantage this time,” said Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Antidoping Agency. Tygart knows that a certain number of the nearly 3,000 athletes based in the United States that his agency tracks have been taking illegal performance enhancing drugs. He said they told him so. While so many athletes were stuck at home with little to do during the pandemic, USADA worked with researchers at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro on a survey about doping. More than 1,400 athletes in the USADA testing pool participated in the anonymous survey. Just under 10 percent said they had taken a banned performance-enhancing drug during the past 12 months, including 2.5 percent who admitted taking the most potent drugs, such as testosterone, human growth hormone and drugs that increase red-blood cell production and oxygen capacity. Another 4 percent said they had used marijuana, with the rest admitting to using less potent drugs illicitly, such as medication for asthma that can improve lung capacity or drugs that modulate hormone levels.
