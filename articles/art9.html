By Julie Bosman, Sarah Mervosh and Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio KENOSHA, Wis. — When Americans voted in this presidential election, they made it clear that of all the crucial issues facing the country, the coronavirus pandemic towered over the rest. They remained diametrically opposed, however, on how the pandemic reflected on President Trump. In the Midwest — states that were battlegrounds in the presidential race and where the virus has soared — supporters of Mr. Trump defended his handling of the crisis, praised his efforts to revive the economy and echoed his suggestions that the virus’s dangers were overblown. And on Wednesday, with all eyes on the election outcome, new records in Minnesota and Indiana pushed the country above 100,000 virus cases in a single day for the first time since the pandemic began. Those who voted for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. frequently said that Mr. Trump’s response to the pandemic had given them one more urgent reason to vote him out. “We need somebody in office who has a game plan,” said Gabrielle Young, a 30-year-old health care worker in Kenosha, Wis., who said she had never cared about politics in the past.
