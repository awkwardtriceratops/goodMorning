By Troy Closson and Ed Shanahan A Black man died of suffocation in Rochester, N.Y., after police officers who were taking him into custody put a hood over his head and then pressed his face into the pavement for two minutes, according to video and records released by his family and local activists on Wednesday. The man, Daniel Prude, 41, died on March 30, seven days after his encounter with the police, after being removed from life support, his family said. His death occurred two months before the killing in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis set off protests across the United States. But it  attracted widespread attention only on Wednesday when his family held a news conference to highlight disturbing video footage of the encounter taken from body cameras that the police officers wore. The New York State attorney general, Letitia James, and the Rochester police chief said they were investigating the death. The officers involved are still on the force.
