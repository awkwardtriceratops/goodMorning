By New York Times Opinion Welcome to Opinion’s commentary for the town halls featuring Donald Trump and Joe Biden. In this special feature, Times Opinion writers rate the event on a scale of 1 to 10: 1 means it was a snooze; 10 means it was must-see TV. Here’s what our columnists and contributors thought of the town halls. Frank Bruni (Score: 2) For the first half-hour, I struggled to retain consciousness. By the last half-hour, I had plunged into a state of political somnambulism I last visited when Steve Forbes ran for president two decades ago. In other words, Joe Biden had an excellent night. My low rating for how compelling his performance was equals a high rating for how smart it was. Biden is protecting a lead, which argues for finessing answers to tough questions (check), giving weedy answers that run out the clock (check), splitting the difference between the center and the left (check) and oozing sincerity and warmth (check, check). Also, what a contrast: His face never reddened. His voice never rose. Please, please, four years of this. Michelle Goldberg (Score: 7) Look, it was boring, but in a deeply soothing way. Joe Biden was unusually fluent and wonky, especially on foreign policy. He was even good on weak parts of his record like the 1994 crime bill. I don’t believe for a second that, as he insisted, four to eight Republican senators would be willing to compromise with a Biden administration, but I suspect his promises of bipartisanship go over well with swing voters. And he finally gave a semi-straight answer on court packing, saying, of the Amy Coney Barrett confirmation, “It depends on how this turns out.” The Trump adviser Mercedes Schlapp tweeted that the town hall “feels like I am watching an episode of ‘Mister Rodgers’ Neighborhood.’ ” Apparently she thinks that’s a bad thing. Melanye Price (Score: 7) After listening to Trump’s platitudes and chaos for four years, I thought Biden’s informed discussion was refreshing and almost overstimulating! Peter Wehner (Score: 7.5) Biden was sharp — in command of the facts, engaged and reassuring, likable, vulnerable and modest. What came through most clearly was his good character, his core decency and empathy, and his sheer normalcy. Biden’s temperament and disposition are just what America needs after four years of the sociopathic presidency of Donald Trump. Frank Bruni Early on, when I was at peak alertness, Biden digressed from a recitation of pandemic-related counsel that he’d given to offer an apology of sorts: “I don’t want to say ‘I, I, I.’” How refreshing. Take the first-person singular away from President Trump and you’ve gutted his entire vocabulary. Biden’s one possible misstep? An apparent promise to take a firm stance before Election Day about expanding the Supreme Court. Michelle Goldberg When it was over, Biden put his mask on and kept up a (socially distanced) dialogue with the audience. I wish ABC had left the audio on, but even without it, the visual showed how comfortable he is connecting with normal people, in contrast to our cloistered and emotionally stunted president. Melanye Price He missed an opportunity with his answer to the young Black man (a key demographic), leaving the young man clearly unconvinced despite being too polite to say so. Peter Wehner Biden’s best moments came when he spoke not about policy but about concepts like honor and decency, why holding grudges never works and his commitment to heal a weary and wounded nation. My guess is that most Americans who watched came away feeling they got a glimpse into who Joe Biden is in some fundamentally important way and what they saw was deeply reassuring and comforting. Sometimes you get the sense that the person and the moment match, and that is how I increasingly feel about Biden in 2020. Who knew? Elizabeth Bruenig (Score: 3) Neither amusing nor informative, the entire production was one long low point. The moderator, Savannah Guthrie, was aggressive, which is probably the only way to handle an interviewee as unruly as Trump, but the president was, as ever, himself. The net effect was watching an hourlong verbal altercation in which bickering periodically gave way to timorous questions from well-meaning voters, which did nothing but make the tension more unbearable. Matthew Continetti (Score: 7) Trump’s closing argument. He made a case for a second term based on the economic and foreign policy achievements that preceded the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. He spent much of the event on defense, but the final moments offered Trump a chance to remind undecided voters about the pre-Covid world and project optimism about the future. Trump spent a lot of time parrying the moderator’s follow-up questions and rebuttals. The back-and-forth denied him opportunities to shift focus to the Biden-Harris agenda and draw contrasts with the Democratic ticket. But Trump avoided a repeat of the debacle at the first debate. Michelle Cottle (Score: 3) The president looked and sounded healthy, enabling him to spew his fountain of misinformation with vigor. Daniel McCarthy (Score 7) The adversarial interactions between President Trump and Savannah Guthrie were a reminder that the president is running against much more than Joe Biden. It’s not objectivity vs. Trump’s subjectivity, however. It’s one subjectivity — one forgiving toward the political establishment — vs. Trump’s subjectivity. And this clash forces Americans to be more critical in their media consumption as well as politics: a good thing.
