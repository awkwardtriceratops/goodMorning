By Bryan Pietsch A woman, a teenager and two children were found dead in a fire at a Philadelphia rowhouse on Saturday morning, the authorities said. The victims were discovered after firefighters entered the home while it was still burning, said the city’s fire commissioner, Adam Thiel. The medical examiner has yet to confirm the causes of the deaths. The medical examiner’s office declined to comment. The woman, who was 35 years old, was found downstairs in the home, a spokesman for the Philadelphia Police Department said. Two boys, 9 and 17, and an 11-year-old girl were found in the upper level of the home, the police said. The victims were pronounced dead at the scene a little after 8 a.m. Commissioner Thiel said firefighters responded to a call about the fire shortly before 8 a.m. and encountered heavy fire and smoke from the first and second floors. Firefighters were alerted that there were people trapped inside, he said at a news conference on Saturday. “The level of fire spread happened very fast, apparently,” he said.
