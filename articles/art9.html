Within hours, the kind of unrest sparked in other cities by fatal confrontations between African-Americans and law enforcement began bubbling up in Lafayette. The tension might have escalated into something larger. But two major storms were churning in the Gulf of Mexico and appeared to be intensifying, with Lafayette in their projected path, and the protests were brought to a near halt. Still, the killing on Aug. 21 tapped into a sense of fury, fueled by longstanding racial divides and disparities, that had been simmering in the city. Recently, city officials tried to close several community centers that serve mostly Black neighborhoods, a debate that played out amid a pandemic that has been especially punishing to the African-American community. In many ways, the troubles facing Lafayette, in the heart of Louisiana’s oil patch, reflect the stresses that have afflicted America this year. Over the last several months, the city’s 126,000 residents have negotiated an exhausting catalog of hardships — a coronavirus that has infected thousands, a hobbled economy, protests over police violence and systemic racism and, over the past week, a brutal hurricane season. “We’re hurting right now,” said Diane Touchet, who lives near the Shell convenience store where the authorities said Mr. Pellerin, 31, was shot at least 10 times. She was referring not only to the pandemic, but to the broader turbulence. “We’re human beings just like everybody,” Ms. Touchet, 59, said. “We count, too.” Tropical Storm Marco mostly fizzled out on Monday, and Hurricane Laura slammed the Louisiana coast but largely spared Lafayette. The outrage, though, remains — and it has deepened for many as they have seen Mr. Pellerin’s death lost in a cascade of crises, from the exacting toll of the virus to this week’s storms to the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man in Kenosha, Wis. “Louisiana is used to being looked over,” said Lyle Edwards, a 61-year-old airport cargo worker, “and that’s what the residents here are feeling.” Mr. Pellerin was shot after officers responded to a call of a person with a knife at a convenience store, according to a statement from the Louisiana State Police, which is investigating the case. The police said that Mr. Pellerin ran from officers, who failed to stop him with Tasers. The officers opened fire, the state police said, as Mr. Pellerin, who still carried the knife, tried to walk into another store. Video of the shooting shared on social media showed the officers surrounding him as he approached the store’s door. The next day, dozens of protesters swept into the streets. Demonstrators linked arms as they disrupted traffic and faced off with police officers, who broke up crowds with chemical dispersants and made a handful of arrests. That same weekend, residents were urged to hunker down or get out of town as Gov. John Bel Edwards warned of a potential “one-two punch” in which Marco and Laura could strike within a 48-hour span. “We are not deterred by a little rain,” Jamal Taylor, who helped organize the protests, said. But by Wednesday, the night before Hurricane Laura made landfall as a Category 4 storm and battered the southwest corner of the state, the demonstration had fallen to roughly 30 people outside the federal courthouse. About 150 miles west of New Orleans, Lafayette is known as the provincial capital of a region populated by French-speaking Cajuns and Creoles. It is about one-third Black and still bears the scars of segregation, with the poorer, Black neighborhoods separated by a highway from the wealthier, mostly white neighborhoods.
