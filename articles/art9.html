By Rob Henderson Mr. Henderson is a Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge. At first, I thought class was about money. “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” taught me that it wasn’t. I started off in what most people think of as America’s lower class. I was given up for adoption when I was 3; I spent the next four years in seven foster homes. When I was 7, I was adopted and subsequently settled in Red Bluff, Calif., a working-class town, population 13,147, median household income $27,029. Two years later, my adoptive parents got divorced; after that, my adoptive father severed ties. When I was 15, I got my first job, as a dishwasher at a pizza restaurant, and on breaks, all my conversations with co-workers eventually turned to the topic of money. We would fantasize about what we would do if we suddenly had it: vacations, cars. In high school, we’d hear rumors that so-and-so was rich, because their parents had a second house or a boat. We all thought that money was the important thing: If you had it, you were “rich” — which for us was indistinguishable from “elite.” If you didn’t, you weren’t. This was true, to an extent. But it wasn’t the whole story. How did I learn it wasn’t? From television. It’s possible I watched more TV from birth to age 17 than most upper-class Americans watch their entire lives. In my foster homes, the television was playing constantly. My foster siblings and I fought over which shows to watch. Early on, we’d argue over “Power Rangers” or “Rugrats”; later, it was “Family Matters” or “Full House.” Later, after my parents got divorced and my mom began working full time, the duplex we lived in was often empty. I’d turn the TV on first thing in the morning and again as soon as I got home from school. Certain shows were staples that I watched with rapt attention; others played in the background whenever my mom wasn’t around, telling me to turn them off. Today I’m a Ph.D. student at Cambridge University. As someone who has had to navigate a long journey through a variety of social milieus — first foster care and my hometown, then the military, then Yale — television has been a constant and lifeline. It’s been both entertainment and social guide, teaching me the language and the ways of thinking I needed to move fluidly, more or less, from one environment to another.
