By Lisa Lerer and Jennifer Medina President Bill Clinton introduced America to the “soccer mom,” anxiously shuttling her children across swing state suburbs in her minivan. President George W. Bush’s re-election campaign found another cutesy moniker, dubbing those voters worried about terrorism after the attacks of Sept. 11 “security moms.” President Trump’s handling of the pandemic is generating an entirely different sentiment, one not traditionally bestowed upon female voters or mothers. “I am a rage mom,” said Senator Patty Murray, the highest-ranking woman in Senate leadership. “Well, a rage nana, at this point, as my granddaughter would say.” With millions of American families facing an uncertain start to the school year, the struggle for child care, education and economic stability is fueling a political uprising, built on the anger of women who find themselves constantly — and indefinitely — expected to be teacher, caregiver, employee and parent. As the pandemic roars on, voters across America remain deeply angry and worried about the future. But the vocal outrage from women, in particular, is clear on protest lines and in polling data. Women were more likely than men to report having participated in protests over the past two years, and mothers with children in the home were twice as likely as fathers to report participating in a protest, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll from June. Now, the rage moms are railing in Facebook groups about school shutdowns and in teacher union meetings about reopening without proper protection from the virus. They’re also packing virtual town halls with frustrations about schools, child care and the lack of leadership. “There’s nobody giving us solutions,” said Kim Lopez, a mother of three in Glendale, Ariz., and part-time financial assistant, who is still unsure what her children’s schooling will look like this year. Ms. Lopez said she never considered herself political until this summer, when she brought her children to a small Black Lives Matter protest in the Phoenix suburbs. “It’s as if they don’t care what happens to families.” Ms. Lopez is exactly the kind of voter Democrats hope will push them to victory in November, and they are aiming to turn that frustration with government inaction into a vote against Mr. Trump. Last month, the Biden campaign kicked off a “Moms for Biden” group. On Zoom, one person after another spoke of fears and frustrations. Asked to name the most pressing issue for her, one mother couldn’t narrow it down. Instead, she simply said “less worry.” Voters are likely to hear more about those child care concerns at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night, with remarks from many of the party’s most influential female politicians, including their new vice-presidential nominee, Senator Kamala Harris. The broader focus on caregiving issues marks a significant shift in the political climate of even a few months ago, when Senator Elizabeth Warren made child care a centerpiece of her campaign in the Democratic presidential primary. At campaign events six months ago, Ms. Warren’s proposals for universal, government-funded child care would elicit nods primarily from mothers in the crowd, she said, followed by quiet conversations in the selfie line with women about their personal struggle balancing work and child care. During a virtual town hall meeting she held last month, however, more than half of the questions from the audience of 70,000 people were about schools, child care and working parents. “Right now, I think women have just had it up to their eyeballs,” Ms. Warren said in an interview. “They no longer feel isolated and one-off in how they couldn’t figure out how to make the system work, and recognize the system is broken, and nobody’s making it work.” Ms. Warren added: “They’re fired up. And I love it.” The pandemic is the spark but the backlash against Mr. Trump has been burning since the day after his inauguration, when millions of women joined protests across the country. Their fire has endured through #MeToo, waves of teachers’ strikes led by predominantly female unions, the outcry against school shootings, and Black Lives Matter demonstrations, a movement started largely by female racial justice activists. For the second election cycle in a row, a record-breaking number of female candidates are running for federal office. Mr. Biden’s selection of Ms. Harris was widely seen as a nod to the energy women have given the Democratic Party during the Trump era. “Women are mobilized on a bigger scale than we’ve seen in a generation at least,” said Annelise Orleck, a historian at Dartmouth College who studies women’s political activism. “Women are organizing all across the spectrum.” The activism is diffuse and multiracial, reflecting political battles that working class women have long waged for better health care, schools and child care. In some ways, more affluent suburban women are simply waking up to the untenable choices poorer women and women of color have faced for generations. While the anger is loudest on the left, Democrats hope to capitalize on indications that the rage reaches across party lines. The rebellion by white college-educated women against Mr. Trump helped Democrats win key swing districts in 2018, giving the party control of the House. In recent weeks, support for Mr. Trump has begun to drop among white non-college educated women and older women — two more ideologically moderate groups that bolstered his winning coalition four years ago. The gender split among suburbanites is striking: In a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, Mr. Biden leads by 24 points among suburban women and just four points among suburban men, a statistical dead heat. “I am so full of rage,” said Alida Garcia, the vice president of Fwd.us, an immigration advocacy group and mother of 1-year-old twins. “We are exhausted.” Last month, Mr. Biden announced a sweeping $775 billion caregiving proposal that would cover care for young children, older adults and family members with disabilities. He often invokes his experience as a single father caring for his two young sons after his first wife and daughter were killed in a car crash. Mr. Biden has repeatedly described caregiving as an economic necessity that deserves sustained support, a marked shift in political rhetoric on a topic that was often seen by politicians as a special interest, not an issue to put at the center of a campaign. Other Democratic politicians, too, have begun more forcefully addressing caregiving concerns. Last week, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sponsored a webinar on “How to Organize a Child Care Collective.” Parents with minor children make up about one-third of the country’s work force, according to the Brookings Institutions. In 2018, 23.5 million working parents relied upon school and child care programs while they went to work. “For the last 10, 20 years, this has been sidelined and siloed as just a women’s issue,” said Brigid Schulte, who runs the Better Life Lab at New America, a research group. “It’s not and it never has been.” Throughout American history, women have wielded an image of maternal respectability to push for labor reforms, temperance, stoke fears of communist infiltration in the 1950s and other political causes. In recent years, mothers-turned-activists have begun political organizations, including Moms Rising, Vote Like a Mother and Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy organization. The majority of volunteers with Indivisible, a liberal advocacy group that helped propel several Democrats to Congress in 2018, are women, and the topic of child care has become a de facto part of many meetings across the country. “There isn’t a single thing you can offer up to women now, whether it’s text banking, leadership training, organizing skills, that’s not immediately oversubscribed,” said Cecile Richards, the head of Supermajority, an organization founded last year with the goal of mobilizing female voters. “It is this extraordinary moment when women are in the ascendancy and finally the issues that women have to deal with every day are at last in the public conversation in a way that they have not been in any time I remember.” Ms. Richards says Supermajority planned for 800 women to sign up for a recent organizing training it offered. It got 1,800 responses in the first week. “Moms definitely know how to multitask,” said Smitha Chadaga, who has spent a career working as an internist in a hospital and became politically active after the 2016 election, when her children asked if their family would have to leave the United States. (Dr. Chadaga’s parents immigrated from India and her husband’s family came from Nicaragua.) In addition to her work and her involvement with an Indivisible group in Portland, Ore., Dr. Chadaga is caring for her two boys, ages 8 and 10. It is impossible to miss the heightened interest and anger of mothers, she said. “The fact that we do not value child care, that we don’t value early education, this is not something that Covid created — it’s something that Covid exposed,” she said. “The moms and parents around me are all feeling that very same thing.” While Democrats have proposed the most ambitious plans to tackle child care, there are some signs that Republicans, too, are facing pressure to address the issue. Last month, the House passed two bills that would provide more than $220 billion in funding for child care centers and tax credits. Each bill had support from more than a dozen Republicans, a notable number in a deeply polarized Congress. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, another primary candidate who made child care a central part of her presidential bid, said she constantly hears from people who are worried about child care. “It wasn’t easy for most parents that I’ve talked to. To have no access to child care is crippling,” she said. She hopes the crisis point reached by many families during the pandemic will create political momentum for policies like paid leave, universal early childhood education and universal sick days. For Ms. Murray, the activism is both hopeful and a bittersweet reminder of just how much has stayed the same over three decades. “I came here, as a senator, as the first working mother. I am now, a generation later, watching my daughter and son deal with the same issue,” Ms. Murray said. “This pandemic has ripped wide an open wound that families have struggled with for a long time.” Giovanni Russonello contributed reporting.
