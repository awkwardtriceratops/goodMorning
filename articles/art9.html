Season Kicks Off With Players’ Protesting Racism<br></h1><p id="artcont">After an off-season of social turmoil, the Houston Texans chose not to be on the field for the playing of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” and “The Star-Spangled Banner” before the league’s season opener in Kansas City, Mo. By Ken Belson After an off-season of social and political turmoil, N.F.L. players made it clear on the night of the season opener that they will continue to shine a light on social injustice and police brutality against African Americans. The Houston Texans, who were in Kansas City, Mo., on Thursday to face the Chiefs for the first game of the year, remained in their locker room during the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” which is known as the Black national anthem. After the protests following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in late May, the league said the song would be played before every game in Week 1 of the season. The Texans stayed inside to keep the focus on systemic racism and to avoid a debate over kneeling or standing during either or both songs. “It’s really not about the flag, it’s about making sure that people understand that Black lives do matter,” Texans Coach Bill O’Brien said after the game. The Chiefs lined up along their sideline while “The Star-Spangled Banner” played. One player, defensive end Alex Okafor, knelt and raised an arm. A teammate put his hand on Okafor’s shoulder. Many other players linked arms. NBC Sports did not show the Texans’ empty sideline. After the anthem was played, the Texans ran on to the field to a smattering of boos from the Arrowhead Stadium crowd, which had been reduced to 22 percent capacity because of the coronavirus. Both teams then were booed as they linked arms in the middle of the field for a moment of silence, which Texans defensive lineman J.J. Watt called “unfortunate.” Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson, who were both outspoken this summer about the need for change, were at the center of the line, arms linked. The protests at the N.F.L. opener were the latest in a wave of demonstrations by professional athletes that began late last month with the widespread postponement of games as players in the N.B.A., the W.N.B.A., Major League Baseball and other leagues chose to walk out in response to the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. Even though about 70 percent of its players are Black, the N.F.L. has wrestled for several years with how to react to player protests and calls to address systematic racism and social injustice. The league largely ignored quarterback Colin Kaepernick when he knelt during the national anthem throughout the 2016 season to protest police brutality against African Americans. But after President Trump in September 2017 called for teams to fire players who did not stand for the anthem, the league and its owners tried to tamp down protests while also pledging tens of millions of dollars to groups fighting social injustice. The league backed off trying to ban protests during the anthem after the players’ union filed a grievance. Kaepernick, once considered one of the sport’s rising stars, has not been on an N.F.L. roster since the 2016 season, and in 2017 he accused the league of blackballing him because of his protests. The N.F.L. agreed to a multimillion-dollar settlement of the case. In November, the league organized a tryout for Kaepernick, but the two sides could not agree on the terms of the audition. Kaepernick held his own workout in front of about a half-dozen scouts, but he remains unsigned.
