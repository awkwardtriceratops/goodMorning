Then a Gunman Showed Up at His Church.<br></h1><p id="artcont">The church helped him have a second chance at life. Two decades later, Edward James, 62, was killed trying to  help another man do the same. By Juliana Kim To his friends, Edward James was the prime example of someone who had thrived after getting a second chance. He had been an alcoholic for years before sobering up and being hired as the caretaker at the Glorious Church of God in Brooklyn. Mr. James, 62, never forgot the hard times he had experienced, his friends said, and he was quick to offer help to elderly, sick and homeless people in his neighborhood. “He was a true caretaker, not just of the church but everyone he loved,” his cousin, Carleton King, said. Last Monday, Mr. James was shot and killed inside the church, and on Thursday, a homeless man he had tried to help was arrested and charged with his murder. Mr. James’s body was found in the sanctuary on the second floor, a few feet from the pulpit. The brazen killing rattled a Brooklyn neighborhood already struggling with a wave of gun violence unlike anything seen in years. Shootings have doubled this year in the 81st precinct in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where Mr. James resided, in part helping to fuel a citywide surge in violence in which more than 1,000 people have been shot and 290 killed in the first eight months of the year. Moments after community leaders held a news conference on Tuesday in front of the church to denounce Mr. James’s killing and call for a stronger police presence, another man was shot a few blocks away.
