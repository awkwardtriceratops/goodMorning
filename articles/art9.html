Let’s Check.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Here’s a report card on whether the president met his 2016 campaign pledges. By Nicholas Kristof Opinion Columnist Four years ago as a candidate, President Trump made more than 280 campaign promises. Let’s see how he did: “I will build a great, great wall on our southern border …” (speech, June 16, 2015) While Trump so far has built 307 miles of walls along the 1,984-mile border, much of this replaces previous barriers that were dilapidated or blocked only vehicles. “… and I will have Mexico pay for that wall.” Mexico is not paying for it. The new wall is costing about $30 million per mile and will be expensive to maintain, for human smugglers have cut open the wall with $50 cordless saws. “We will find them [all undocumented immigrants], we will get them out.” (CNN interview, July 29, 2015)
