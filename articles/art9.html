By Christina Goldbaum Every day when Betty Cheong walked from the subway to her office in Lower Manhattan, she passed a haunting reminder of the dangers of cycling in New York: a bicycle painted white and adorned with flowers, propped against a pole, marking the spot where a cyclist had been killed. The sight alone was enough to keep her off a bike. Then the pandemic hit, emptying the subway of wary riders and draining the streets of traffic. Cycling suddenly seemed like a safer way to get around: In April, Ms. Cheong started using the city’s bike-sharing program. Then, she started participating in bike protests. In July, she bought a bike of her own. “The more I biked, the more confident I got about biking in the city,” Ms. Cheong said. Since the coronavirus engulfed the United States, a bicycling craze has swept the country, sending bike sales soaring and triggering a nationwide bicycle shortage. In many cities, but perhaps most notably in New York, much of that growth has been driven by a surge in the number of women who took to bicycling after lockdown orders eliminated the main barrier research has shown keeps women from cycling: streets that often feel perilous for cyclists. In New York, there were an estimated 80 percent more cycling trips in July compared with the same month last year, with biking by women rising by 147 percent and increasing by 68 percent among men, according to data from Strava Metro, a mobility tracking application used by 68 million people globally. But now traffic is rising again and it remains unclear whether the momentum will continue. Cycling advocates say the city should build on what has happened during the outbreak and do more to create a transportation network that prioritizes cycling as a greener way to travel. Other major American cities, including Washington, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles, have also experienced a biking renaissance largely fueled by women: The number of female cyclists in each of those four cities increased by over 80 percent in August compared with the same month last year, while the increases in the number of male cyclists were much smaller. The spike in female cyclists marks a notable turnabout in New York, where the system of bike lanes is often disjointed and obstructed by cars, and lacks bike parking, which has discouraged cyclists. For most of the past decade, male cyclists have outnumbered female cyclists by three to one. But the outbreak has quickly upended the scene on the streets. On Citi Bike, New York’s bike-share program, women now make up the greatest share of users since the program was introduced in 2013. Since March, the percentage of women actively using Citi Bike and purchasing memberships for the first time both climbed to around 40 percent of total members, record highs in each category.
