She’s the only person for the job. By Caity Weaver If you have ever seen a peregrine falcon slice cleanly through the pale dawn to capture and dismember a starling midair, you have a rough idea of what will happen this weekend, when the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards ceremony is hosted to within an inch of its life by Keke Palmer. The assignment is both a perfect application and shameful waste of Ms. Palmer’s talent for showmanship. Every year for the past three, the V.M.A.s have plunged deeper into record-setting ratings lows, excavating previously undiscovered levels of audience indifference. If this year’s broadcast follows the same pattern, the fault will lay with MTV’s rigid adherence to custom and the fragmentation of cultural consumption, rather than with Ms. Palmer, 27, who is all but certain to execute her task with brazen aplomb. Ms. Palmer will present the V.M.A.s on Sunday because MTV has wisely asked her to, but she could just as comfortably be hosting the Oscars, a Zoom funeral, a vice-presidential debate or “The Ellen DeGeneres Show Starring Keke Palmer.” Keke Palmer holds the eye. “My skin’s falling off,” she said matter-of-factly at the start of a FaceTime call this month from her Manhattan apartment — and it was. Not from nerves (she judged her nervousness level about the impending event to be a polite 6; it seemed more like an honest 0.5). Ms. Palmer’s skin was being corroded in real time by acid from a pre-V.M.A. chemical peel. Dried scrolls curled away like sheaves of ancient parchment from her lovely almond-shaped eyes and apple cheeks. “I’m trying to stop you from having to see that,” she said, extending her arm to hold the phone as far as possible from herself. Things about Ms. Palmer that set her apart from the rest of humanity and make her particularly suited to guiding the masses through the tribulations of live television: She is energetic, charismatic and imbued with a superabundance of screen presence (for evidence, see her starring role as an inspirational 11-year-old spelling champ in “Akeelah and the Bee” from 2006, or her scene-stealing turn as a convivial stripper who drugs and robs men in last year’s “Hustlers”); she can manifest natural gravity to an effect either comedic (see: the “sorry to this man” meme) or profound (see: footage of her pleading with armed National Guardsmen in Los Angeles to join protesters in the wake of George Floyd’s death); she can control the flow of conversations by approaching sentences at a running start (see: National Guard footage); she is indefatigable (see: previous film work, TV work, musical work and also a new Facebook TV show featuring a family of five characters she created on social media, all of whom she portrays). She is possessed of remarkably bright, gaze-holding eyes, enunciates like a tongue twister and speaks from her diaphragm. Perhaps most important, she is as quick on her feet as wing-sandaled Hermes, the sociable messenger god who escorts the souls of the dead to the underworld much as Ms. Palmer will guide MTV viewers to the depressing Best Music Video From Home category on Sunday night. In her 2017 book, “I Don’t Belong to You: Quiet the Noise and Find Your Voice,” Ms. Palmer — who grew up in Section 8 housing outside Chicago and was starring in (and performing the theme song for) her own Nickelodeon show by age 15 — writes movingly, and with lots of emoji, about her adolescence spent managing anxiety as the primary breadwinner for her family of six. “One of my responses,” she writes of her extraordinary childhood, “as a defense mechanism, was to become very positive about everything in my life.” Ms. Palmer made her first film appearance in 2004 at age 9 in “Barbershop 2.” Over the next decade and a half, she worked constantly, as an actress (in more than 55 films and TV shows), a singer (she has released seven singles), a talk-show host (she’s hosted two, including an Emmy-nominated stint on a “Good Morning America” spinoff), a dating show host (on Quibi) a stage performer (Broadway’s first Black Cinderella) and, lately, as a reliable source of viral moments. The capacity to spontaneously generate one’s own cheer is a prerequisite for professional TV hosts. They must soothe and charm an audience in the face of technical difficulties, awkward and off-putting acceptance speeches and other acts of God. Ms. Palmer’s ability to embody that energy, even when not presenting the day’s entertainment news in digestible chunks to ABC viewers, is in some ways her calling card. She wields her good humor with the ease of a master swordsman. But that does not mean it was forged without effort. “I wore other people’s expectations on me,” Ms. Palmer said on the FaceTime call. “It started twisting from being positive to thinking that making other people happy is my job.” Over time, the young Ms. Palmer’s aversion to disappointing strangers shrank her world — a world that, though it included life lessons from Laurence Fishburne, was more insular, in many ways, than the lives of children who, say, went to school. Because she was reluctant to decline photo requests from fans under any circumstances, “it got to the point where I stopped going places,” Ms. Palmer said. “That’s how I would deal with it. I would just not really go places where people could ask me.” In promotional videos from the early aughts for the Nickelodeon-themed cruise trips Ms. Palmer took as part of her duty as network talent (she starred for three seasons as a kid fashion executive on the Nickelodeon sitcom “True Jackson, VP,” — a job that found her on set for 10 hours a day, five days a week, for periods of six months), a teenage Keke beams at the camera while articulating her excitement about various excursions and planned onboard activities. “I didn’t like them,” she recalled, sheepishly, of the cruises. “I felt like SpongeBob, but I couldn’t take the suit off.” (This observation is not entirely abstract; Ms. Palmer’s cartoon colleague SpongeBob SquarePants manifested at sea as an individual in a removable costume.) “I did the second one because I wanted my little brother and sister to be able to go, but I just stayed in my room the whole time,” she said. Later, with a note of longing while describing carefree cruise scenes from her own imagination — bumping into one’s new cruise friends at the buffet, for instance — Ms. Palmer declared: “My personality is made for a cruise!” (Ms. Palmer has never taken a non-Nickelodeon themed cruise.)
