Leader, Is Accused of Conspiracy<br></h1><p id="artcont">The ex-president of the United Auto Workers was charged with using union funds for personal expenses. The case is part of a long federal investigation. By Neal E. Boudette and Noam Scheiber Federal prosecutors on Thursday charged a former president of the United Auto Workers union, Dennis Williams, with conspiring to embezzle union funds for personal expenses and luxury travel. He is the 15th person accused in a broad investigation into corruption at the union. Mr. Williams, 67, the U.A.W. president from 2014 to 2018, used union money to pay for private villas in Palm Springs, Calif., expensive cigars, golfing apparel, greens fees at golf courses and lavish dinners, according to documents filed by prosecutors in federal court in Detroit. The Justice Department contends that Mr. Williams conspired with his immediate successor, Gary Jones, who pleaded guilty to similar charges in June, and several other senior U.A.W. officials. Matthew J. Schneider, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, described the investigation as the largest of its kind into a labor union. “This case is very disheartening,” he said in an interview on Thursday. “It’s charging a president of the U.A.W., and he was conspiring with another president of the U.A.W. It’s disgraceful to think that these crimes reached so far up in the ranks of the union.” Lawyers for Mr. Williams did not respond to requests for comment. A person close to Mr. Williams previously denied to The New York Times some of the accusations against him. The investigation has raised questions about whether the federal government would seek to take control of the U.A.W., as it did with unions like the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Mr. Schneider said he did not want to put the U.A.W. under federal supervision. “I don’t want to run the union. I want the men and women of the union to run it,” he said. “That said, all options are on the table.” The investigation of the U.A.W. dates back to at least 2015 and has resulted in guilty pleas from at least 11 union officials and three former executives of Fiat Chrysler.
