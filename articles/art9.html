Around the country, the virus left its mark.   By Julie Bosman, Audra D. S. Burch and Sarah Mervosh RACINE, Wis. — They were feverish and desperate, confined to their cars in a slow single-file line as they waited for coronavirus tests. A few rolled down the windows to let the 72-degree breeze from Lake Michigan inside and leaned back on the headrests, eyes closed. One family of five, with three children in the back seat of a minivan, had already driven around for hours, trying to find a testing site that was not full. The coronavirus is surging out of control across the country, and more than 117,000 cases were reported on Thursday, more new cases than on any other day of the pandemic. In 43 states, new infections are climbing steadily higher. To many Americans, the pandemic’s march feels inexorable.      “We knew it was just a matter of time,” said Matt Christensen, sitting in the passenger seat of the minivan alongside his wife. In a single day across America, the coronavirus churned through homes, workplaces, hospitals, schools and laboratories. From dawn to nightfall on Thursday, the worst day of the pandemic in terms of new cases, snapshots offered glimpses of the virus’s persistent spread and devastating fallout: In Cleveland, lab workers began another grinding day of processing coronavirus tests. In Minot, N.D., a hospital scrambled to find space for the crush of coronavirus patients who came through the doors. In Unionville, Conn., grieving relatives finalized plans for the funeral of a family’s 98-year-old matriarch, who died from the virus. And in Missouri, officials interrupted the day with a jarring announcement: A person who tested positive for the coronavirus last week disregarded orders to isolate and worked as an election judge in suburban St. Louis on Tuesday. The person, whom St. Charles County officials did not identify,  has since died. On Thursday morning, governors began what is now a familiar routine, pleading in front of news cameras for Americans to do their part to stop the spread of the coronavirus. In Iowa, where cases have increased 118 percent over the past two weeks, Gov. Kim Reynolds urged residents to take action at what she described as a critical period in the state’s fight. “For the next three weeks at least, I am asking Iowans to make every effort to help us stop the spread of Covid-19,” said Ms. Reynolds, who echoed warnings from hospital leaders that capacity could be stretched if cases continue to surge. Dr. David Williams, the chief clinical officer of UnityPoint Health, put it more bluntly. “Fellow Iowans, my job is to tell you it’s time we have to start listening,” Dr. Williams said. That message was echoed hours later by Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, after announcing that a record 4,961 people in his state received coronavirus diagnoses in a single 24-hour period and that 541 people were seriously ill in intensive care, the most of the pandemic.
