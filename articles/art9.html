What do you think about the way Supreme Court justices are now chosen, and how the court functions? What changes, if any, would you like to see? Would you prefer term limits for justices, for instance, or do you think the size of the court should be increased? Submissions should be no more than 150 words. Please include your name, city, state and contact information, and put “Supreme Court” in the subject line. Email: letters@nytimes.com </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
