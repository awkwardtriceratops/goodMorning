Skepticism had abounded in the 15 years since construction first started on the project, which was initially known as Xanadu Meadowlands and promised extravagances like an indoor ski slope. But the mall cycled through developers and billions of dollars in funding, and faced numerous delays. Once Triple Five, the Canadian real estate firm behind the Mall of America in Minnesota, took over in 2011, it was determined to reignite enthusiasm for the project. It changed the name from Xanadu to American Dream, altered an exterior that then-Governor Chris Christie had called “the ugliest” in the state and promised even more marvels, like an indoor water park and additional roller coasters. But only months after portions of the complex began opening, starting with its ice-skating rink and a Nickelodeon amusement park, the pandemic hit. “It was extremely, extremely unfortunate, the timing of it all,” Don Ghermezian, chief executive of Triple Five and co-chief executive of American Dream, said in an interview. “The shutdown came in March, only a couple of days before we were planning to open the balance of the center.” Mr. Ghermezian said he was upbeat about the future of the mall, which reopened some of its attractions on Oct. 1. But the pandemic has battered many retailers and shopping malls and left many shoppers skittish about much of what Triple Five was betting on — travel, crowds and the allure of indoor spaces. It has also put a spotlight on the money tied to the success of the complex, which is now facing the threat of yet another shutdown during the all-important holiday shopping season as coronavirus cases spike again. “It definitely is tremendously bad luck,” said Vince Tibone, a retail analyst at Green Street, a commercial real estate analytics firm. “Until there’s a widespread vaccine, and both domestic and international travel rebounds to what it used to be, it’s going to be hard for this mall to get the foot traffic it was hoping for.” Triple Five, which also owns Canada’s West Edmonton mall, had anticipated 40 million visitors a year at American Dream, a notably ambitious figure that would put it on par with Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla. Mr. Tibone noted that the complex was already facing questions around how it would shuttle tourists between Manhattan and northern New Jersey. And beyond pandemic-forced store closures, American Dream is facing the issue that its attractions — from its ski slope and caviar bar to its roller coasters and DreamWorks-themed water park — are indoors at a time when public health officials are telling people to stay outside. All three of Triple Five’s malls have suffered this year because of the pandemic, including the Mall of America, which reportedly entered a cash-management agreement last summer after missing months of mortgage payments. The company projected that the American Dream complex would eventually support more than 20,000 jobs and generate nearly $150 million annually in state and local taxes, a lawyer for Triple Five wrote in an April letter to the Federal Reserve about its so-called Main Street lending program for midsize businesses. But the mall was still in the process of opening in phases it called “chapters” and its mid-March shutdown came just days before the center could open its most standard offering — its retail stores.
