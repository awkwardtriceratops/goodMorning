By Michael Crowley WASHINGTON — When President Trump presided over a grandiose White House signing ceremony for new accords between Israel and two Arab states last week, his re-election campaign wasted little time cashing in. Two days after the event, his campaign released a slick, 30-second ad featuring footage from the ceremony and depicting Mr. Trump as a heroic peacemaker for bringing Israel into normalized relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. “They said it couldn’t be done. But President Trump did it,” a narrator declares in the dramatic tones heard in Hollywood blockbuster previews. “The first Middle East peace agreement in decades.” In an election dominated by the coronavirus pandemic, racial unrest and now a Supreme Court vacancy, the president’s Middle East deal has already faded into the endless news cycle. But the ad is the latest sign that however much Mr. Trump might value his diplomacy for its potential to reshape the region, his campaign also sees a potent political message that may not be top of mind for most voters but could move a handful of the right ones in the right places. Trump allies say the deal resonates particularly with Jewish Americans, who are a key voting bloc in the critical swing state of Florida, and evangelical Christians, who are fervent supporters of Israel and its broadest territorial claims. “This is an important event, not just because of the substance but because of the symbolism as well,” said Matt Brooks, the executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition. “This shows that the president is indeed a peacemaker, he is a statesman, he has done something which successive administrations before him have been unable to do — and on a grand and historic level.” “I think that shows to people who may not be necessarily tuned in to foreign policy that he’s got the leadership and judgment to act on a vision and have success,” Mr. Brooks added. Democrats call such talk wishful thinking, arguing that voters currently care little about foreign policy. They also note Mr. Trump’s unpopularity among American Jews, citing a poll released last week by the Jewish Electorate Institute, which found that he trails his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., 67 percent to 30 percent among Jewish voters. “Whatever their long-term meaning, I’m not sure that these deals, coming as late as they are in the middle of a pandemic and the final throes of the race, mean that much,” said David Axelrod, a former senior strategist to President Barack Obama, even before the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday. “It’s not where people are focused and voters tend to discount late-breaking announcements as part of the campaign.” “Even for older Jewish voters in Florida, I suspect the U.A.E. and Bahrain were not foremost on their radar screen when it comes to Middle East peace,” he added. “I’m not sure it changes much.” At a minimum, however, a slew of positive headlines about Middle East “peace” — even if it has been years since Israel had genuinely hostile relations with the Emirates or Bahrain — provided Mr. Trump with a welcome distraction from other negative news, including his admission to the journalist Bob Woodward that he had intentionally downplayed the coronavirus this year.
