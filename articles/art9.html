The damage could last years, and layoffs, service cuts and added debt are all on the table. By Dana Rubinstein The unemployment rate in New York City is 16 percent, twice as high as the rest of the country. Personal income tax revenue is expected to drop by $2 billion this fiscal year. Only a third of hotel rooms are occupied, and apartment vacancies in Manhattan have hit a peak. New York, more than any large city in the world, has been forced to grapple with the coronavirus outbreak’s dual paths of devastation: The virus has killed 24,000 people in the city and has sapped it of hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in tax revenue. And even as the city has contained the spread of the virus, it has been unable to exert control over its threat to the economy. Numerous economic indicators suggest that New York City will face an extended financial crisis, the likes of which has not been seen since the 1970s. The city has already slashed spending to make up for billions of dollars in lost tax revenue, but it may lose billions more. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo have repeatedly asked the Trump administration for help, but the president, a native New Yorker who openly scorns his city of birth, has instead threatened to cut its federal funding. Should he win re-election in November, it seems likely that the city will be forced to implement drastic layoffs and service cuts. New York City may even be compelled to borrow just to keep everyday services running; the mayor has asked state leaders to grant the city the authority to do so. So far, the state has resisted.
