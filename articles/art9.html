She clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, a giant of conservative jurisprudence, and his influence is evident throughout her judicial career. Opponents of abortion, in particular, are hoping that her accession to the Supreme Court would be a crucial step forward for their movement. Her nomination ceremony in the Rose Garden this past weekend appeared unremarkable. But it took place just weeks before a presidential election and barely eight days after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Republicans have the votes in the Senate to confirm Judge Barrett and a timetable that suggests that they would be able to do so before Election Day. With her path seemingly clear, we reflect on Judge Barrett’s career and her judicial philosophy. On today’s episode: Adam Liptak, who covers the Supreme Court for The New York Times. Background reading: In choosing Judge Barrett, President Trump opted for the candidate most likely to thrill his conservative base and outrage his liberal opponents. Judge Barrett’s record suggests that she would push the Supreme Court to the right. Here’s a guide to her stance on abortion, health care, gun rights and the death penalty.
