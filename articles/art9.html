By Ed Shanahan Federal prosecutors on Wednesday filed charges against two men accused of causing civil disorder in attacks on police officers during a night of sometimes violent protests in Rochester, N.Y., over the weekend. It was at the least the third instance this week in which federal prosecutors intervened in cases where people have been accused of attacking officers during protests against police brutality and systemic racism. Such cases have typically been handled by state prosecutors. Federal prosecutions of people arrested during protests have escalated since the civil unrest that emerged around the nation after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. President Trump has blamed the disorder on antifa, a label that has come to be associated with a loose movement of left-wing protesters who engage in aggressive techniques like vandalism. The administration has pushed federal prosecutors to forcefully clamp down on the demonstrations, using the civil disorder statute to charge protesters, most recently in Portland, Ore., and Charleston, S.C. The protests in Rochester began last week after the public disclosure of the circumstances surrounding the March death of Daniel Prude, a Black man who suffocated after police officers put a hood over his head and pinned him to the ground. The men who were charged on Wednesday, Dallas Williams-Smothers and Adam Green, were part of a crowd of protesters that grew to around 1,500 people on Saturday night, the authorities said. Some of those in the crowd hurled rocks, bottles, lit fireworks and other objects at the police, while others shined lasers at the officersâ€™ eyes, officials said. The police responded by ordering the crowd to disperse.
