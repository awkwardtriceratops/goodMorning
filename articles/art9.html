Gore All Over Again?<br></h1><p id="artcont">A Florida judge examines a disputed ballot from the 2000 presidential election.Credit...Alan Diaz/Associated Press Supported by By Linda Greenhouse Contributing Opinion Writer This is not a column about a case that’s pending at the Supreme Court — yet. It’s about the nightmare scenarios surrounding the presidential election and its aftermath that could conceivably propel a case there. Such scenarios are being contemplated and written about with increasing urgency as President Trump ramps up his predictions of voter fraud, setting the stage for challenging the legitimacy of an election that he appears, at this point at least, likely to lose. Trying to chase such thoughts from my mind only seems to magnify a growing free-floating anxiety to which I’ve recently attached a diagnosis: Bush v. Gore PTSD. Anyone who lived through the denouement of the 2000 presidential election will understand what I mean; it’s hard to believe that an entire generation has come of age with no personal memory of what happened that cold December night nearly 20 years ago when a five-justice majority handed the presidency to George W. Bush. But I was there in the Supreme Court pressroom on Dec. 12, 2000, as the clock ticked down toward midnight and the country held its breath to see what would become of Florida’s 25 outcome-determinative electoral votes. In the pressroom, we assumed that the justices, who had heard argument on the disputed Florida election only the day before, had voted and that they intended to issue their decision that night, in time to meet the statutory “safe harbor” deadline for a state to immunize its electoral-vote result from challenge in Congress. With six million Floridians having voted, George W. Bush was ahead of Al Gore by 537 votes. A decision might come at any moment, so no one dared to leave the small room. It became packed so tightly with reporters and television crews from around the world that my most pressing fear was that the enclosed space would run out of oxygen and we would all be asphyxiated. And then it was over. At 10 o’clock, with an unsigned and barely rationalized opinion issued over four signed dissents, the court barred all further counting. The justices had left the building. All the public saw that night were television correspondents, bundled against the wind on the court’s plaza, frantically turning pages to try to figure out what to tell their audience. Could something like that happen again?
