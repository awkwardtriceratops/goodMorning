By Daniel Victor This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others here. David Maas, half of a husband-wife magic act that achieved YouTube stardom, performed on some of television’s biggest stages and kept basketball fans nationwide nailed to their seats at halftime with their lightning-fast costume changes, died on Sunday in Chicago. He was 57. The cause was Covid-19, said the couple’s agency, Hoffman Entertainment. In 1996 he and Dania Kaseeva married, and the couple first performed their “Quick Change” routine that would stump audiences for decades. Garishly dressed from the outset, they would dance around, then cover each other for mere seconds before emerging in new garb, the old outfit nowhere to be found. The illusion was performed under the veil of a sheet, or even a toss of confetti. It would land the duo on programs like “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” “Ellen” and a slew of late-night shows, and as guests on “Big Brother.” They helped Katy Perry, the pop singer, perform her own rapid costume changes during concert performances of the song “Hot N Cold.” Former President George H.W. Bush requested their act three times at his home in Maine, according to the couple’s website. They performed at magic shows and festivals worldwide. And they appeared on “America’s Got Talent,” the NBC variety show in which they made it to the semifinals in 2006. One of their performances on the show that year became the third-most-watched video on YouTube of the year.
