Lee Faces Revolt Over Racism<br></h1><p id="artcont">The Kappa Alpha Order’s Xi chapter fraternity house at Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas.Credit...Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times Supported by By Amy Harmon Kappa Alpha, one of the nation’s largest and oldest college fraternities, is not unaccustomed to fending off charges of racism. Its embrace of Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general, as a “spiritual founder” has rankled students and faculty members. Black student groups have protested its antebellum-themed spring formals. One campus demanded an apology after Kappa Alphas recited a chant lamenting the Union victory in the Civil War. But the killing of George Floyd has for the first time started a racial reckoning within the fraternity’s own chapters. Members of the Southwestern University chapter demanded that the fraternity drop its association with Lee and investigate the racial harms they say Kappa Alphas have inflicted. “KA nationally has a deeply troubling history that active chapters can no longer cry ignorance to,” they said in a statement drafted over often-tense Zoom meetings and GroupMe texts. The unusual breaking of ranks was initiated this summer by Noah Clark, a Southwestern alumnus who had, in 2017, become the first Black student to graduate as an active member of the college’s Kappa Alpha chapter. Kappa Alpha’s national organization then suspended the chapter, angering even some Black students on the Georgetown, Texas, campus who have not typically regarded Kappa Alphas as allies. “My first reaction was, ‘I can’t believe they’ve gone and done this,’” said Pierce MacGuire, 29, referring to the chapter posting the statement. Mr. MacGuire, an alumnus who voted for President Trump, lent his support to the statement after being approached by Mr. Clark. He added, “It’s not a group you would typically expect to be the people on the front line of a protest.” The national ferment over race has reached many American institutions, including professional sports leagues, major corporations and Hollywood. Yet the dissent within Kappa Alpha, pieced together through interviews and by reviewing text exchanges and other documents, caught many familiar with the fraternity by surprise. Kappa Alphas at Southwestern are “not known for doing the work of race relations,” said Ivan Maina, co-president of Ebony, a Black student group at Southwestern. A few years earlier, when some members pushed to remove a portrait of Lee hanging in the fraternity house, the majority voted to leave it up. The chapter, home to both liberals and conservatives, is officially “apolitical,” many members said. But discomfort with Kappa Alpha’s reputation on race had been building in the chapter for some time. Privately, some of its younger alumni had begun to call the fraternity’s depiction of Lee “indoctrination.” More Latinos had joined the chapter. And a call to action by Mr. Clark — one of three Black alumni in the chapter’s 137-year history — after Mr. Floyd’s death proved hard to ignore. “I think everyone has wanted to do something like this, but the courage within the active chapter has never been there,” said Jeremy Wilson, a senior member of the chapter, who like all active members who spoke to The New York Times for this article did so against the chapter’s instructions. In the days following Mr. Floyd’s death, Kappa Alpha had released a statement from its national headquarters in Lexington, Va. “Any act of racism is abhorrent and betrays everything for which Kappa Alpha Order stands,” it read. The Southwestern chapter had posted one, too, noting its donation to the Black Lives Matter Global Network. But the skeptical comments that fraternity brothers received from other students stung. As one member characterized the typical response: “‘Cool, but isn’t your spiritual founder still Robert E. Lee?’”
