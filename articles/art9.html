By Catie Edmondson Senate Democrats plan on Thursday to present their most comprehensive strategy yet to confront and compete with China, rolling out sprawling legislation that would provide more than $350 billion over a decade to build the United States’ industrial capacity and challenge Beijing. The bill, led by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, and Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, seeks to shore up the nation’s manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure in an attempt to unwind it from China’s economy and increase American firms’ competitiveness. It comes as relations between Washington and Beijing have spiraled downward, setting the stage for a new era of confrontation, and as President Trump and congressional Republicans, especially in the Senate, have sought to harness Americans’ growing animosity toward China as a political weapon against Democrats.
