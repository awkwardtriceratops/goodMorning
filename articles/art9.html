Cuomo Resists, Even With a $14 Billion Budget Gap<br></h1><p id="artcont">State Democratic lawmakers are pressuring Gov. Andrew Cuomo to approve a tax on the wealthy, fearing that budget cuts will hurt those most in need. By Luis Ferré-Sadurní and Jesse McKinley For years, progressive Democrats in Albany have been pushing a three-word solution to many of New York’s problems: Tax the rich. Yet year after year, proposals to make the wealthy pay more were blocked by Republicans. Now, however, their most staunch opponent may well be the state’s third-term governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, a socially progressive Democrat who often boasts of his history of tax cuts. That approach appeals to most taxpayers, and is easier to understand during a decade of financial growth. But as the coronavirus pandemic has transformed New York’s financial problems from merely troubling to catastrophic, a growing contingent of Democrats in the all-blue Legislature is pushing the governor to reconsider his stance. They say the state must increase taxes on the wealthy to safeguard services for New York’s neediest, which could be decimated if the state were forced to make broad cuts because of the looming deficit. “We are playing with fire: These are people’s lives,” said State Senator Alessandra Biaggi, a Democrat representing parts of the Bronx and Westchester County who is co-sponsoring a bill to tax the ultrawealthy. “It is not OK to not act.” The fiscal hole is daunting: The state faces a $14.5 billion budget gap this fiscal year, according to budget officials. Mr. Cuomo, however, says the potential benefit of new revenue from taxing the rich would be far outstripped by the negative impact on the state’s highest earners, who already shoulder the bulk of the state’s taxes.
