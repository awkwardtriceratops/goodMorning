But past experience shows the path from recommending restitution to actual return can be a long one. By Claire Moses The Netherlands should return looted art to its former colonies: That’s the official recommendation of an advisory committee to the Dutch government. After a year of research, including interviews with people in former Dutch colonies such as Indonesia, Suriname and several Caribbean islands, the committee released its report in Amsterdam on Wednesday. The decision on whether to return an object, however, would ultimately rest with the Dutch government, and after a similar recommendation was made in France in 2018, only a single object has since been given back. “The principle is fantastic,” said Jos van Beurden, an independent researcher who has specialized in restitution since the 1990s, of the Dutch decision. “But I’m worried about the execution.” The lawyer and human rights activist Lilian Gonçalves-Ho Kang You, who led the committee in the Netherlands, said in an interview that the government should acknowledge the injustices of colonialism and be willing to return objects without conditions if it can be proven that they were acquired involuntarily, and if their countries of origin ask for them. The report calls for the creation of a body of experts to investigate objects’ provenance when requests are made, and a publicly accessible national database of all the colonial collections in Dutch museums. Ingrid van Engelshoven, the Dutch minister of education, culture and science, who commissioned the report, said in an emailed statement that it offered “clear starting points for a new way to handle colonial collections.” She said she would present draft legislation based on the advice in early 2021. The Netherlands owns hundreds of thousands of objects that were acquired during the country’s colonial history. But the exact number is unknown. Creating a database and researching the background of all these objects would be a huge undertaking, according to Mr. van Beurden. Recent experience in France shows that when it comes to restitution, the path from ideas to action can be a long and winding one. After a high-profile 2017 speech in which President Emmanuel Macron promised to return much of Africa’s heritage, he commissioned a report from two academics who said that items brought to French museums without the permission of their countries of origin should be returned, if they were requested. Since 2018, when the report was released, only 27 restitutions have been announced, and only one object, a traditional sword from Senegal, has been returned. Delays like this have frustrated restitution advocates. Earlier this year, a Congolese activist tried to remove artifacts from African collections at museums in Paris, Marseilles and the Netherlands. In a live-streamed speech before seizing a funerary post at the Quai Branly Museum in Paris, the activist, Mwazulu Diyabanza, said he had “come to claim back the stolen property of Africa, property that was stolen under colonialism.” On Tuesday, France’s National Assembly passed a bill that would allow the official restitution of the 27 items, including 26 which would be returned to Benin, within the next year. The bill now has to be considered by the French Senate.
