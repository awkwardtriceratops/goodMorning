But in many local elections, systemic racism and police reform have emerged as dominant themes. By John Eligon and Audra D. S. Burch [Race affects our lives in countless ways.

A former judge in Iberia Parish, La., who is running for district attorney has promised to change how prosecutors make charging, plea and bail decisions. And in Hamilton County, Ohio, the race for the top prosecutor pits a Republican incumbent running on a “tough-on-crime” platform against a Democrat and former judge who is pushing to eliminate cash bail for nonviolent offenses and create a conviction integrity unit. While the coronavirus and battered economy have overtaken issues of race as the focal points in presidential and congressional campaigns, despite the disproportionate impact of both on communities of color, systemic racism and police reform have emerged as dominant themes in a number of local elections. In states across America, from California to Kentucky to New York, many voters said they saw the races for sheriffs, prosecutors and council representatives as having more consequence to their lives. In South Carolina, Kristin Graziano, a 32-year police veteran, is challenging Sheriff Al Cannon, who has held the Charleston County post since 1988. Ms. Graziano, a Democrat, said she had been thinking about race and policing for years, particularly after the death of Walter Scott, a Black man who was killed by a white North Charleston police officer in 2015. Ms. Graziano, 53, has centered much of her candidacy on issues of accountability and diversifying the department, which covers a county that is almost one-third Black. If elected, Ms. Graziano, who is white, would be the first woman to serve as a sheriff in the state. “When unarmed men get shot in the back running away from police and when people get choked out in handcuffs, obviously those are not right,” said Ms. Graziano, who began her law enforcement career in Charlottesville, Va. “It’s a systemic problem, it’s always been a systemic problem. I think it’s a very small portion that have the bias, but we have to own it.” Mr. Cannon, who is white, said the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers, which led to thousands of protests across the country this summer and conversations about race and racism, sharpened a collective focus on racial injustices. But, he said, his department was already making progress, including efforts to reduce the county’s inmate population. And about three months ago, Mr. Cannon, 74, said he moved to avoid “flash points,” such as directing the force to issue citations rather than make arrests for possession of small amounts of marijuana.
