It doesn’t matter that I feel like an impostor sometimes — there’s an expectation that I’ll be able to handle any cooking question. I deal with this by openly admitting when I don’t know something and then letting in-depth research guide me to a satisfying answer. (It helps that I’m usually genuinely curious to find out.) I used to frequent libraries and stand at the shoulders of cooks, furiously taking notes, then call with follow-up questions. I would often visit immigrant communities to eat the same dish at several restaurants to learn about variations. But the pandemic has changed how I can pursue answers. The flavor touchstones and other sensory cues I once scavenged for in my reporting aren’t available to me right now, because I’m not observing other cooks or tasting their food before I sit down to write. Because I can’t use firsthand experience to guide my storytelling right now, I’ve started to depend on the vibrant taste memories of others instead. I had to rely on this new way while recording an episode of “Home Cooking,” the podcast I started with my friend Hrishikesh Hirway to offer listeners a little quarantine levity. Hirway, a talented musician and podcast creator, chooses from among the questions our listeners record and send in for me to answer. When he played a question from a listener wondering what she could cook one-handed — she had injured her wrist shortly after taking up roller-skating as a new stay-at-home hobby — I suggested she use a rice cooker to make khichdi, a dish of rice and lentils, versions of which are found across South Asia. It’s often the first solid food babies eat in India. Though I didn’t grow up with it, I think of it as a comfort food and love eating it with generous amounts of yogurt and mango pickle. “Can I tell you about my favorite kind of khichdi?” asked Hirway, who is Indian-American. “You can’t make it one-handed, but it’s called sabudana khichdi, and it’s made with tapioca. It’s one of the things I crave most.” “Oh, my God!” I interrupted, “I’m Googling my butt off right now!” I love tapioca, and though I’ve always wondered what a savory tapioca dish might be like, I had never actually cooked or even tasted one. The images I found were of a pilaf with medium-size tapioca pearls, toasted peanuts, potatoes and a few spices. “This looks so good!” I told Hirway. “It’s spicy but simple,” Hirway said. “All of its textures make it incredibly comforting. When I was little, my mom would make sabudana without peanuts for me, since I was allergic, and I hated it because there was no crunch. But I eventually grew out of the allergy, and now, when I go home, I eat ungodly amounts of it because it is so addictive and delicious. It’s one of the top five dishes that make me happiest in life.”
