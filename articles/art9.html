Mr. Barnes died in a plane crash. By Sam Roberts “Deeper Understanding. Better Solutions,” one venerable law firm promises. “A Broader Perspective,” another pledges. “Character Comes Through,” still another avows. In less than a generation, though, Ross M. Cellino Jr. and Stephen E. Barnes transformed their two-partner outpost in Buffalo into perhaps the most famous personal injury law firm in America not by invoking lofty slogans but by blitzing the airwaves with visceral advertising — “Injury? Head-on? T-bone? Rear-end?” — an indelible callback phone number and, as one publication described it, an “earworm” of a jingle. All of it together made the two lawyers’ names and faces (Mr. Barnes was the bald one) familiar to almost anyone in New York and California who for years heard Cellino & Barnes radio spots, watched their television commercials or encountered their billboards. It didn’t last, however. In 2017, continuing grumbling between the partners about nepotism and mismanagement finally boiled over bitterly in court. Mr. Cellino sued to dissolve their professional corporation and open his own family firm. Mr. Barnes countersued, charging trademark infringement. The divorce was finalized this summer, with each man regrouping with relatives and loyal employees in his own firm. Last Friday, Mr. Barnes was piloting his TBM 700 turboprop six-seater plane from Manchester, N.H., back to Buffalo for his mother’s birthday party when the aircraft crashed near Pembroke, about 20 miles east of Buffalo Niagara International Airport. Mr. Barnes, 61, was killed. So was his only passenger, his niece Elizabeth D. Barnes, 32, who, like her father, Richard Barnes, was also a lawyer in the firm. Federal officials were investigating the cause of the crash. In a statement afterward, Mr. Cellino called Mr. Barnes “a fearless advocate for his clients.” “His passing is a significant loss for the legal community,” he said. Before their falling out, the two had complemented each other. Steve Barnes, two years younger than his partner, was a former Marine officer who could eviscerate a hostile witness in the courtroom and struggled to smile through the firm’s marketing campaigns. In their ads, the more laid-back Mr. Cellino wore the easy smile. The two men founded their firm in 1994 and commissioned an advertising slogan from a local jingle writer for $500: “Cellino and Barnes. Injury attorneys. 800-888-8888 — Don’t wait. Call eight!” Having bought that easy-to-remember telephone number for $1.7 million, the lawyers over time pumped more than $150 million into radio and television advertising, billboards and other promotions, taking advantage of successful court challenges in the 1970s, on free speech grounds, against rules that had barred advertising by lawyers.
