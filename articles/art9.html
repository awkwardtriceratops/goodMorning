By Kenneth Chang For decades, physicists have dreamed of discovering a material that could effortlessly convey electricity at everyday temperatures, a feat that would save gargantuan amounts of energy and revolutionize modern technology. Writing in the journal Nature, a team of researchers announced on Wednesday that they have done just that. They have made a superconductor that works at 58 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of a cool autumn day. This material is still far from practical, produced in only minute quantities and under immense pressures usually found closer to the Earth’s core. But the scientists hope that with further experimentation they can devise a variation of their material that remains a superconductor even after that pressure is removed. “Ultimately, we want to bring the pressure to almost ambient pressure, to actually have an actual application,” said Ranga P. Dias, a professor of physics and mechanical engineering at the University of Rochester and the senior author of the Nature paper. Shanti Deemyad, a professor of physics at the University of Utah who was not involved with the research, said, “It’s a very robust study, very beautifully done.” The first superconductors observed by scientists lost their electrical resistance only at ultracold temperatures, a few degrees above absolute zero, or minus 459.67 degrees, the lowest possible temperature. In the 1980s, physicists discovered so-called high-temperature superconductors, but even those became superconducting at temperatures far more frigid than those encountered in everyday life. The latest research is an outgrowth of predictions decades ago that hydrogen, the lightest of elements, turns into a metal and then a superconductor, possibly at room temperatures, when sufficiently squeezed. But pure hydrogen is difficult to work with. Three years ago, Dr. Dias, then a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard, and Isaac Silvera, a Harvard physics professor, reported that they had produced the long sought metallic form of hydrogen. That claim, not yet reproduced, is still viewed skeptically by many. Scientists also started looking at hydrogen mixed in with another element. The bonds between the atoms of the other element might help compress the hydrogen together. In 2015, Mikhail Eremets, a physicist at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany, reported that hydrogen sulfide — a molecule consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one sulfur atom — turned superconducting at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit when squeezed to about 22 million pounds per square inch. That was a record warm temperature for a superconductor at the time. “That’s, I would say, the game-changing paper that sort of set the tone,” Dr. Dias said.
