By Julie Turkewitz and Anatoly Kurmanaev On Monday, Peru’s legislature selected the country’s third president in a week, seeking to stanch growing street protests over lawmakers’ decision to remove a popular president from office last week. But the decision to name Francisco Sagasti, an engineer and academic who became a first-time legislator in March, as the country’s new president was not expected to quell popular anger at the country’s legislators. Many in Peru see the legislators as venal, corrupt — and responsible for adding political turmoil to the economic and a public health crises the country was already facing. The problem Peruvians face now is that the same deeply unpopular and inexperienced Congress is charged with moving the country beyond these emergencies. “God willing, they have finally chosen a better leader,” said Eduardo Carita, 47, walking toward Congress on Monday to join a protest just before the announcement, “but truthfully I have little faith in them.” Peru’s political tensions erupted into open conflict last week, when Congress relied on an archaic constitutional clause to remove Martín Vizcarra, a well-liked president, for “moral incapacity,” just five months before new elections. Mr. Vizcarra had earned the support of a majority of Peruvians — and the enmity of much of the legislature — by leading efforts to clean up the country’s notoriously corrupt establishment. About half of Congress is under investigation for crimes that include bribery and money laundering. His unexpected removal from office, and the swift swearing in of a new president, Manuel Merino, the head of Congress, left Peruvians suffering from a severe economic downturn, and from one of the world’s highest coronavirus death rates, at the hands of a leader few knew or trusted. The population poured its anger into the streets, and Mr. Merino resigned after less than six full days in office.
