After disturbing calls and texts, they bought guns for protection. By Serge F. Kovaleski and Dan Barry DAPHNE, Ala. — The terrifying calls and texts to the Rust family began soon after Ryan Rust became an inmate in the Alabama correctional system. Before long, his relatives were arming themselves for protection. “I bought an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and 1,000 rounds of ammo because things had become so serious,” Jeff Rust, his father, said. “These inmates have reach that goes way beyond the prison.” That life-rattling reach is facilitated by the inmates’ relatively easy access to an item they supposedly forfeited once they entered the Alabama prison system: cellphones. Extortion by prison pay phones has long been a problem. But illegal cellphones have facilitated the delivery of threats, vexing corrections officials across the country. Smuggling of the devices is common, often by prison workers eager for money, and jamming cellphone signals is not allowed because it would also disrupt 911 calls and other public safety communications. Jeff Dunn, Alabama’s corrections commissioner, said the state’s prisons have tried to cut down on contraband, using surprise searches and phone-sniffing dogs, but phones keep getting in. The state’s longtime failure to stem their proliferation has allowed inmates to use the devices to threaten and extort families of vulnerable prisoners. The typical threat — pay or your loved one gets hurt or even killed — is delivered by call or text. Images of the threat being carried out sometimes follow. One such vulnerable prisoner was Ryan Rust, who was physically imposing, adorned with tattoos and saddled with a prescription-drug addiction. He served time in the Alabama prison system from late 2015 to late 2016 for property theft, and was back in prison by January 2018 after being convicted of rape.
