By Sarah Bahr Jerry Harris, a student featured in the Emmy-nominated Netflix series “Cheer,” was sued on Monday by 14-year-old twin brothers in Texas who say that he solicited sex, sent them sexually explicit messages via text and social media, and asked them to send nude photos of themselves. The lawsuit, filed in the District Court of Tarrant County in Texas, accuses Mr. Harris, who is now 21, of asking one of the boys for oral sex at a cheerleading competition and threatening “imminent physical bodily injury.”
