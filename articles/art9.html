By Annie Karni WASHINGTON — When Dr. Sean P. Conley stepped in front of the cameras at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Saturday, he delivered a briefing that seemed intended less to inform the American public than to satisfy the public relations demands of a famous and famously demanding patient — President Trump. “He’s doing great,” he said. But moments later, the president’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, speaking off camera and on the assumption he would not be identified, offered a contradictory assessment, noting “the president’s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning, and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care.” “We’re still not on a clear path to a full recovery,” he added. The radically different message was stunning, and at first attributed, at Mr. Meadows’s insistence, to “a source familiar with the president’s health” speaking on background, but later identified as the chief of staff. The discordant statements were a revealing insight into the dynamics behind the Trump White House’s frequent release of misleading information, particularly about the president’s health. Dr. Conley is a Navy doctor and Mr. Trump is not only his patient but his commander in chief. The president is known to be especially interested in presenting his health in the best possible light, and his health has never been an issue the way it is now. It is almost certain he was watching Dr. Conley’s news conference on TV in his hospital room. For Mr. Meadows, the clarification appeared to be an effort to lay some groundwork for the possibility that Mr. Trump’s condition could worsen, raising the prospect of a potential transfer of power to Vice President Mike Pence under the 25th Amendment. Mr. Meadows, a former congressman from North Carolina, also may have been concerned about his own credibility with journalists in a post-Trump political world. But the net result of the two conflicting accounts was that in the middle of a pandemic and election that have accentuated the distrust of the government by both left and right, the American public does not have a definitive answer to the condition of the first president to be hospitalized since Ronald Reagan. While misleading information has been a hallmark of the Trump presidency, the White House physician — Dr. Conley and before him, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson — has been put in a particularly awkward position and provided murky, inaccurate and sometimes inappropriate accounts of Mr. Trump’s health that have included a description, in Dr. Jackson’s case, of the president’s “incredible genes.” All have been in service of a president who has refused to disclose any details about his physical condition that would undermine the narrative that despite his age, 74, a diet that is heavy on fast food and a deep aversion to exercise, he has the stamina and strength of a man half his age. Hours after Dr. Conley’s Saturday news conference, during which he dodged questions about whether the president had been on oxygen and inaccurately suggested that Mr. Trump was only “slightly overweight,” Dr. Conley was forced to issue a correction on some of his remarks. After saying the president had been diagnosed 72 hours before, which would have meant that Mr. Trump continued with a normal schedule of rallies and fund-raisers despite knowing he was ill, Dr. Conley retracted the timeline.
