By Jack Ewing FRANKFURT — On paper the European economy is snapping back smartly from the pandemic, growing more in the third quarter than it ever had. But images from Paris, Madrid and Frankfurt tell a different story. Cafes are rolling up their awnings, theaters are canceling performances, and it’s starting to look like March again on city streets. The risk of another severe downturn in Europe is rising as new lockdowns take effect in countries like Germany, France and Belgium, where the authorities are desperate to prevent a surge in coronavirus infections from overwhelming hospitals. Instead of returning to a semblance of normalcy, governments in the European Union, America’s largest trading partner, are straining to find ways to support furloughed and unemployed workers, and to keep restaurants and other businesses from going bankrupt. This week, in an extraordinary move, the European Central Bank all but promised to unleash new relief measures by December at the latest. Warning that risks are “clearly tilted to the downside,” Christine Lagarde, the central bank’s president, indicated that its Governing Council is just trying to decide what cocktail of lending measures, bond market intervention or rate cuts would best stimulate the eurozone economy. Even Ms. Lagarde, who probably has access to more detailed information about the eurozone economy than anyone on the planet, was unsure whether the region was headed for another big dip or moderately slower growth. The gloomy and uncertain outlook overshadowed Friday’s news of a record 12.7 percent quarterly increase in gross domestic product from the previous quarter in the 19 countries that use the euro. That rebound exceeded economists’ expectations but still left output 4.3 percent lower than it was a year earlier — a severe recession by any standard. A few months ago some optimists were talking about a V-shaped recovery, a sharp decline followed by a sharp rebound, or perhaps a check-mark recovery — a decline followed by a gradual rebound. What is developing looks more saw-toothed, a jagged series of economic ups and downs coinciding with waves of infection and renewed lockdowns. “We are completely reliant on the development of the virus,” said Sylvain Broyer, chief economist at S&P Global Ratings in Europe. The volatile growth pattern repeated itself at the national level. Germany recorded an 8.2 percent increase in G.D.P. in the third quarter compared with the previous quarter, but business surveys indicate that the pace is likely to slow markedly in months to come. France grew more than 18 percent in the quarter, according to official data published Friday. But Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, said a tough fourth quarter would cause the economy to shrink by 11 percent for the full year. The economic cost is particularly high in industries that depend on person-to-person contact. The longer the pandemic lasts, the greater the risk of mass bankruptcies among service businesses like hotels, fitness studios and nail salons. In Paris, the hotel occupancy rate plunged to 26 percent in September, when a new curfew was put into effect, according to MKG Group, a French consulting firm. That figure is likely to worsen. “There is unfortunately still no evidence that you can simply turn on and off an economy like a light switch without causing more structural damage, maybe even a short circuit,” Carsten Brzeski, global head of macroeconomics at ING Bank, said in a note to clients. Only a few months ago, Europe appeared to be coming back to life. Trade fairs resumed and theaters reopened, albeit with restrictions on attendance. La Monnaie, the Brussels opera house, was brave enough to try to stage a production of “Die Tote Stadt,” by Erich Wolfgang Korngold. To avoid the need for an intermission, the performance was slashed to less than two hours, and the size of the orchestra was trimmed so that the musicians would not be crowded too tightly together.
