By Norimitsu Onishi and Constant Méheut PARIS — The word “ensauvagement” has been a favorite dog whistle of France’s far right in recent years, used to suggest that the nation is turning savage. With its colonial and racist overtones, it has been wielded in discussion of immigration and crime to sound alarms that France is being transformed into a dangerous, uncivilized place, stripped of its traditional values. “Behind it, there is an underlying imaginary world, with savages on one side and civilized humanity on the other,” said Cécile Alduy, a French expert on the political use of language who teaches at Stanford University. So it did not go unnoticed this week when sitting ministers of President Emmanuel Macron’s government started throwing around the word themselves, arguing forcefully that talk of France’s “ensauvagement” was legitimate. “Personally, I use the word ensauvagement and I repeat it,” said Gérald Darmanin, the powerful interior minister and head of the national police. Others in the government disagreed, and Prime Minister Jean Castex tried to put a lid on the issue. But that was not before the word’s use had set off a fevered debate — both political and semantical — and underscored how far-right ideas have crept into the mainstream, even as France struggles to deal with widening racial, ethnic and religious cleavages. The debate over the word — igniting at the start of the rentrée, or re-entry after the customary August vacation — now seems certain to set the tone for the rest of the political season, coming as France’s main political parties begin preparing for the presidential election of 2022. For Mr. Macron — whose main challenger for now remains his rival in the last election, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Rally, who popularized the use of the word ensauvagement — that has meant moving further from the center to the right so as not to be completely outflanked. Though Mr. Macron has studiously avoided pronouncing the word himself, some experts said it was no coincidence that some of his top allies have begun talking of “ensauvagement” just as the right and far-right are already making fears over crime a central theme of the next presidential election. “No doubt he considers the biggest threat for 2022 as coming from the right and so that’s the space that he has to shrink and fill,” said Chloé Morin, a public opinion expert at the Fondation Jean-Jaurès, a Paris-based research group. Last week, Valeurs Actuelles, a leading right-wing magazine, published a cover with the banner headline of “Ensauvagement” and under it, “60 days in the France of the new barbarians.” The picture on the cover showed a crowd of people, mostly Black or of North African origin, vandalizing a car during what appears to be a protest. In the same issue, the magazine depicted a current Black lawmaker as an enslaved African. An accompanying fictional narrative transported her to 18th-century Africa, where she was enslaved by other Africans, sold to an Arab slave trader and finally saved by a French missionary who brings her back to civilization in France.
