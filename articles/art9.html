Is Playing With the Pandemic<br></h1><p id="artcont">The virus is spiking in California, Florida, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Missouri — states that host 13 of 32 teams. By Aaron Randle Mr. Randle is a reporter. Along with millions of other football fans across America and the globe, tens of thousands of Kansas Citians like me feverishly want the National Football League to have a full season this year, despite Covid-19. But as the league’s teams began training camp this week in preparation for the start of the season after Labor Day, I spent several days asking myself, other fans and league health officials if the risks are worth it. “We thought about this very long and very hard,” Dr. Allen Sills, the N.F.L.’s chief medical officer and a high-ranking member of the White House coronavirus task force, told me. “What can we do to mitigate risk around our sport and around our clubs?” Earlier this summer, dozens of players — led in part by the Kansas City Chiefs’ biggest offensive and defensive stars, quarterback Patrick Mahomes and defensive back Tyrann Mathieu — launched a #WeWantToPlay campaign on social media. They asserted their eagerness to get back to the game, but demanded more clarity from the league on exactly how it planned to keep N.F.L. players, staff and fans safe. After a series of virtual negotiations, on July 28 the N.F.L. and its players’ association agreed on a number of protective protocols — which include limiting personnel allowed near team facilities, instituting robust testing of players and limiting or eliminating previously sacred face-to-face activities, such as large team meetings or game film review sessions. Countless players remain uneasy. Odell Beckham Jr., one of the N.F.L.’s most bankable brand names, said he didn’t think the N.F.L. should come back this year. And though he later recanted the statement, many other stars have opted out of the season, which typically requires thousands of players and personnel intermingling on the field, in news conferences, in offices and in locker rooms for several months, from September through February. There are few people who would like to see their home team play this fall more than me. I have family members who are named after Kansas City Chiefs players. In middle school, when the Chiefs would lose, I’d be so upset my girlfriend wouldn’t bother talking to me. In February, after the Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers in an epic fourth quarter championship comeback, I took a day off work to fly home for the Super Bowl parade. (And I told my boss that I was, well, taking a break from reporting to fly home for the Super Bowl parade.) As someone who values sports and sports fandom as an anchor of my community, and as part of my regional identity, it was more than worth it. And the coronavirus outbreak, followed by the multilayered failure to contain its spread, has been the most brutal of comedowns. With Covid-19 still coursing throughout the country, some marquee college conferences, such as the Big East, Big Ten and Pac-12, have canceled their fall seasons for player safety. And there is a growing chorus questioning the prudence and morality of the N.F.L. season going forward. “I’m a football guy,” Dr. Zachary Binney, an epidemiologist at Emory University and a die-hard Miami Dolphins fan, told me. “Watching those games on Sunday is like church for me and my dad. I have not missed a game in 25 years. I want this season more than anything right now. But I fear if you do anything outside of a bubble it might get ugly.”
