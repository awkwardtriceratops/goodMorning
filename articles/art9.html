By Ruth Maclean and Cheick Amadou Diouara DAKAR, Senegal — Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, Mali’s ousted president, was released from detention and driven to his home in the West African country’s capital early Thursday, nine days after a military coup brought an end to his seven years in power. A heavy security escort took Mr. Keïta to his house in Sebeninkoro, a residential neighborhood of Bamako, capping his abrupt fall after military officers with guns arrested him, took him to their base and forced him to resign on television.
