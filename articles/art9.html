Will Move Homeless Men from Liberal Neighborhood After Backlash<br></h1><p id="artcont">The move of 300 men to the upscale Upper West Side neighborhood led to complaints and the threat of a lawsuit. By Nikita Stewart Nearly 300 homeless men who had been temporarily living in a hotel on the Upper West Side of Manhattan will be relocated after weeks of backlash from some residents who said the men had diminished the quality of life in the upscale neighborhood. The city had moved the men into the hotel, the Lucerne, in July as part of an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus in New York’s dormitory-style homeless shelters. Overall, thousands of homeless men and women have been placed in hotels around the city. But the decision met with particular blowback on the Upper West Side, becoming a test of values for a largely white neighborhood with a reputation as one of the most liberal enclaves in New York and in the entire country. Some residents created a private Facebook group — Upper West Siders for Safer Streets — and many commenters said the men menaced pedestrians, urinated and defecated on the street and used and sold drugs in the open. Some residents formed a nonprofit, the West Side Community Organization, and hired a lawyer and former deputy mayor, Randy Mastro, who threatened to sue the city. Isaac McGinn, a spokesman for the city Department of Social Services, would not comment on Tuesday on whether the uproar prompted the decision to move the men, but said that their stint in the hotel was always meant to be temporary. “As part of our effort to continually review and streamline the footprint of our shelter locations, while always ensuring effective provision of services, we’re beginning to relocate individuals from several commercial hotel locations,” he said in a statement. Mr. Mastro called the decision to relocate the men “a testament to community organizing.” “Families, seniors, small business owners, longtime residents, and newcomers united. They were shocked and horrified to see what was happening in broad daylight in their neighborhood, and they wanted to do something about it,” Mr. Mastro said. During the coronavirus outbreak, the city’s Department of Homeless Services has moved roughly 9,500 people from shelters into 63 hotels across the city, 32 of which are in Manhattan. The relocations have also led to complaints in other parts of Manhattan and parts of Queens. The city will also transfer women out of the Long Island City Plaza, a hotel in Queens that has also been used by the city during the pandemic. </p><a href="http://manej.life/" id="footer">Go back to MANEJ</a>
