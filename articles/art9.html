By Michael Wilson The images of police officers in Rochester, N.Y., putting a hood over the head of a Black man who later died of suffocation spread rapidly throughout the country. But another troubling moment from that encounter is now also attracting attention: an officer on tiptoes, leaning forward and using his full weight to push down on the prone man’s head. The officer was leaning on the man, Daniel Prude, so heavily that Mr. Prude seemed to think someone was standing on his head. “Get your feet off me!” he shouted before his words became garbled grunts. The officer, Mark Vaughn, maintained this position for at least 68 seconds, according to an analysis of multiple police body cameras by The New York Times. Officer Vaughn later wrote a report of the incident, in which he said that in an effort to subdue Mr. Prude, he “segmented his head.” A paramedic who arrived at the scene told investigators he saw the officer “tripoding” Mr. Prude’s head. The technique, when used properly, is meant as a quick, effective way to subdue a noncompliant person, a method taught to new officers in most every city, county, town and village in New York as part of a statewide police curriculum.
