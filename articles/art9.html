He was detained a short time later, the police said. By Martin Selsoe Sorensen and Megan Specia ODENSE, Denmark — Armed with what the police believe was a fake gun and a mock explosive belt, Peter Madsen ran for the gates at the prison outside Copenhagen where he was serving a life sentence for killing the journalist Kim Wall on his homemade submarine three years ago. But while he managed to get outside the walls of the prison Tuesday morning, he didn’t get far. Five minutes later and just half a mile away, police officers surrounded and eventually detained him, bringing the prison break to a close. Mr. Madsen, a Danish inventor, was already notorious after his conviction in the 2017 killing of and dismemberment of Ms. Wall aboard the submarine he built himself near Copenhagen in a case that horrified the nation. His escape from Herstedvester Prison, on the western outskirts of the Danish capital, captured the country’s attention again, as photos and television footage emerged on local media of Mr. Madsen surrounded by armed police officers and bystanders shouting abuse at him. Mogens Lauridsen, the chief superintendent of the Western Copenhagen police, said at a briefing that in making his escape Mr. Madsen had worn what appeared to be a fake explosive belt and thrown away a “gunlike object” as he fled. “We don’t think it was a gun, but it looked like one,” Mr. Lauridsen said. He said the police were quickly able to surround Mr. Madsen, but took extra precautions because of the belt, and he was only taken back into custody several hours later. Further details on the gunlike object and the belt were not immediately available. Photos and videos posted by Ekstra Bladet, a local news outlet, appeared to show Mr. Madsen seated on the side of the road surrounded by armed police officers with the area cordoned off. Other footage from the scene shows bystanders angrily screaming profanities at Mr. Madsen, and “Drown yourself!” and “You should be dismembered!” The police said that Mr. Madsen didn’t appear to have received outside help in his escape attempt, but that they were investigating that possibility. Nick Haekkerup, the minister for justice, called the escape attempt “very serious” in a post on Twitter and said that prisoners serving a life sentence “shouldn’t be able to escape.”
