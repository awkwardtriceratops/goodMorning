Buoying Artists and Educators<br></h1><p id="artcont">THE NEEDIEST CASES FUND An initiative provides cultural programming to the city’s 1,800 public schools and supports arts organizations in the process. By Sara Aridi When the coronavirus pandemic brought New York City to a standstill, New York Community Trust, a foundation that supports local nonprofits, had many concerns. Among them was that an aggressive response to the virus would spell a blow to the economy — and also to public schools, which had a record $447 million investment in arts education for the 2018-19 school year. When the city announced its 2021 budget in April, cuts included a $15.5 million reduction for the Education Department’s planned $23 million to expand arts education. To help fill that gap, Leigh Ross, a program officer at New York Community Trust, reached out to a team at the department’s Office of Arts and Special Projects. Together, they outlined a plan to provide free and remote arts programming to New York City’s 1,800 public schools — the country’s largest school system. “We created the project to respond to what we saw as an emergency in arts education,” Ms. Ross said. “But I think it’s turned into something that could be used and could be benefiting kids for years to come.” Donate now to the 109th annual campaign of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. All proceeds go to 10 organizations providing assistance to those facing economic hardship. Make a tax-deductible donation through GoFundMe. New York Community Trust, one of 10 organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, allocated a $680,000 grant to the project, most of which is funding four artistic nonprofits that are crafting curriculums under specific disciplines: Carnegie Hall for music, 92nd Street Y for dance, Roundabout Theater Company for theater and Studio in a School for fine arts. Maria Palma, the executive director of the Office of Arts and Special Projects, said that delivering high-quality cultural education is often made possible by connecting students with professional artists. “It really does take a village for us to educate our children,” she said. “This grant was really just in time.” The programming is tailored for kindergarten through 12th grade and, starting this month, will gradually be uploaded to an online portal administered by the Department of Education, making it available to the city’s roughly 75,000 teachers. It amounts to more than 170 hours of instruction, including videos, as well as resources to help teachers — and caregivers who have had to take on the roles of teachers — use the lesson plans in a variety of settings. The Dance Education Laboratory at 92nd Street Y is highlighting dance traditions in New York City, with a focus on “three groups of people who have been marginalized, ignored or completely decimated from American history books,” said Ann Biddle, a founder of the laboratory. Its modules will look at Native American dance and culture, the evolution of tap dance in New York and the work of the choreographer H.T. Chen, which explores Chinese-American history.
