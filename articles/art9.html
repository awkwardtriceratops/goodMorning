By Ruth Graham Jerry Falwell Jr. is suing his former employer, Liberty University, accusing the evangelical college of damaging his reputation in a series of actions taken after his dramatic departure from the school in August. The suit depicts Mr. Falwell and his family as victims of “a malicious smear campaign incited by anti-evangelical forces.” It accuses Liberty of helping to spread “outrageous lies” about him, and “playing right into the hands of sinister operatives with ulterior motives.” The lawsuit was filed in a state court in Lynchburg, Va., on Wednesday. The 29-page complaint includes claims of defamation and breach of contract, and requests a trial by jury. It asks for damages but does not name a specific amount. Mr. Falwell said in August he had walked away with a severance package worth $10.5 million when he resigned. The university has said Mr. Falwell’s severance compensation was dictated by the terms of his pre-existing employment agreement.
