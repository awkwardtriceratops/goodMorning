By Maria Cramer A Texas grand jury has indicted Netflix, prosecutors said Tuesday, on a charge of promoting lewdness in the French film “Cuties,” which has been maligned by some as child exploitation and defended by others as a complex coming-of-age story about preadolescent girls. Netflix was served with a summons last week informing it that grand jurors in Tyler County, a county of about 21,600 people 115 miles northeast of Houston, had indicted the company for promotion of lewd visual material depicting a child, according to prosecutors. County prosecutors said the charge was based on a Texas law that makes it illegal to “knowingly promote” material that depicts the genitals or the pubic area of a child, clothed or partially clothed, and “which appeals to the prurient interest in sex and has no serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.” “The legislators of this state believe promoting certain lewd material of children has destructive consequences,” Lucas Babin, the county’s criminal district attorney, said in a statement. “If such material is distributed on a grand scale, isn’t the need to prosecute more, not less?” Mr. Babin, who said he watched the film, said it was his job “to make calls every day on how to keep our communities safe.” The indictment said that Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos, the chief executives of Netflix, had “recklessly tolerated” the dissemination of the film. Netflix said in a statement that the company stands by the film. “‘Cuties’ is a social commentary against the sexualization of young children,” it said. “This charge is without merit.” It was not immediately clear what penalties Mr. Babin’s office was seeking in its case against Netflix. Its statement described the charge as a state jail felony.
