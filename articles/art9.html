By Maria Cramer An Illinois police officer who shot and killed a 19-year-old Black man who was sitting in a car that was reversing toward the officer has been fired, according to the police. The officer, who has not been publicly identified, was fired on Friday night, three days after the shooting, said Wayne Walles, the chief of police in Waukegan, Ill., 40 miles north of Chicago. “The City of Waukegan terminated the officer that discharged his firearm during that incident, for multiple policy and procedure violations,” Chief Walles said in a statement on Friday. The Illinois State Police said on Thursday that they were investigating the killing of the man, Marcellis Stinnette, who was in the passenger seat of a car being approached by the officer.
