By Kenneth P. Vogel WASHINGTON — Elliot Broidy already had a record when he became a major fund-raiser for the Trump campaign in 2016. Now he has become the latest Trump ally to face criminal charges, this time accused of evading foreign lobbying laws while trying to make money off his access to the administration. Mr. Broidy was charged with a single count of conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act as part of an influence operation that prosecutors say sought to use his political ties to help Malaysian and Chinese interests, according to federal court filings that became public on Thursday. The case centers on an accusation that Mr. Broidy accepted $6 million from an unnamed foreign client to lobby administration officials to end a federal investigation related to the looting of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund, known as 1MDB. It also accuses him of seeking the extradition of a Chinese citizen from the United States. He did not succeed in either effort. While the foreign client was not identified, people familiar with the case said he was the Malaysian financier Jho Low, who the federal authorities say masterminded a scheme to loot 1MDB. Mr. Broidy, 63, is expected to enter a guilty plea to the charge, which was filed last week by prosecutors from the Justice Department’s public integrity section and its election crimes branch and unsealed this week. Mr. Broidy’s representatives declined to comment. The charge against him was detailed in a criminal information, which is often filed in cases in which a guilty plea has been entered.
