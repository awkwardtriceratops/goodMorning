Charles Monroe King, with their infant son, Jordan.Credit...Family photo Supported by By Dana Canedy Ms. Canedy is a former New York Times journalist and the author of “A Journal for Jordan.” I struggled for the words to comfort Jordan, my 14-year-old son. He had come into my room and heard a snippet of a news report that President Trump had called fallen soldiers “suckers” and “losers” — soldiers like Jordan’s father and my fiancé, First Sgt. Charles Monroe King. He was killed in Iraq in October 2006, when Jordan was 6 months old. “Mom, is he talking about my dad?” Jordan asked, his eyes searching and his forehead furrowed in confusion. My son reads me well, and so it took every ounce of my strength not to physically react. “What do we care what anyone thinks,” I said and made a swatting gesture. “We know the truth about your dad’s heroism.” I have spent Jordan’s childhood filling in the blanks, making sure that he knew his father, as a soldier and as a man. But I had never expected that I would need to remind my son of his dad’s honor and sacrifice.
