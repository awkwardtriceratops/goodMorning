By Jeffery C. Mays Six months ago, the 2021 race for mayor in New York City seemed to be coalescing around three well-known Democrats, all male elected officials, and two of them white. The white men, Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, and Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, had name recognition, fund-raising advantages and institutional support, making it hard to fathom any other candidate’s having a serious chance to succeed Mayor Bill de Blasio, who will step down because of term-limit requirements. But then New York City was confronted first by a pandemic that has killed nearly 24,000 people in the city, many of them Black and Latino, and then waves of civil unrest stirred by Black Lives Matter protests. With 10 months before the 2021 mayoral primary, the race may still come down to Mr. Stringer, Mr. Johnson or the third well-known Democrat, Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, who is Black. But the results of the recent Democratic primary offer evidence that some New Yorkers may be seeking an alternative: a fresh face, perhaps someone more progressive, and not a white candidate who is part of the city’s political establishment.
