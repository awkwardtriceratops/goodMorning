By Derrick Bryson Taylor and Marie Fazio Hurricane Delta intensified into a Category 4 storm on Tuesday and was expected to remain “extremely dangerous” as it reaches Mexico by early Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The storm, the ninth named hurricane of the season, was about 215 miles east-southeast of Cozumel, Mexico, the center said. As of Tuesday afternoon, Delta had maximum sustained winds of 145 miles per hour with higher gusts. The government of Mexico had issued a hurricane warning from Tulum to Dzilam and Cozumel, the center said, and tropical storm warnings were in effect for a portion of western Cuba, Isle of Youth, Punta Herrero to Tulum, and Dzilam to Progresso. “It’s ideal conditions for rapid intensification — warm water temperatures, negligible wind chill,”  said Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist and spokesman for the National Hurricane Center. “This has turned into a very dangerous, very serious hurricane.” The brunt of the storm will hit the Yucatán Peninsula first, he said, and that impact will likely cause the storm to weaken, possibly to a Category 3 storm. But the conditions are ideal for it to strengthen back to a Category 4 as it passes through the southern Gulf of Mexico and approaches the United States as a “major hurricane.” Delta is expected to approach the northern Gulf Coast later this week. While the exact track of the storm remains uncertain, there is a risk of dangerous storm surge, wind and rainfall along the coast from Louisiana to the western portions of the Florida Panhandle beginning Thursday night or Friday.

John Bel Edwards, the governor of Louisiana, and Kay Ivey, the governor of Alabama, declared a state of emergency. “As our coastal areas are still recovering from #HurricaneSally, another system, #HurricaneDelta, is making its way toward the Gulf Coast and could potentially have a significant impact on AL,” Gov. Ivey wrote on Twitter. But first, the storm is forecast to pass southwest of the Cayman Islands on Tuesday morning and move over the northeastern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula by early Wednesday. The storm is then expected to move over the southern Gulf of Mexico by Wednesday afternoon.
