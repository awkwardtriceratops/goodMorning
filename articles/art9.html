By Dave Itzkoff From the moment that an errant fly touched down on Vice President Mike Pence during Wednesday’s vice-presidential debate, “Saturday Night Live” viewers started imploring the show to recreate the awkward moment. And “S.N.L.” did just that — at some extravagant length — in this weekend’s opening sketch, leading off an episode full of comedy monologues that were certain to offend almost every sensibility and political viewpoint. But first, that vice-presidential debate parody, which starred Beck Bennett as Vice President Pence, Maya Rudolph as Senator Kamala Harris and Kate McKinnon as the moderator, Susan Page, who began the broadcast by declaring, “One thing is for sure: If anything’s going to be trending on Twitter tonight, it will be one of the humans involved in this debate.” McKinnon pointed out that the candidates were protected by “buffet-style sneeze guards, on account of one of you works for Patient Zero,” she said. Bennett explained that this was to his liking: “Twelve feet apart and separated by plexiglass is how Mother and I sleep,” he said. There was some cross talk and aggressive interruptions between the candidates, and Rudolph explained the various facial expressions she planned to make while Bennett held forth. “I’d like to hear the Vice President’s response,” she began, “and while he speaks, I’m going to smile at him like I’m at a T.J. Maxx and a white lady asked me if I worked here.” McKinnon inquired about the health of President Trump, explaining to Bennett that she was “asking with a simmering rage for his incompetence and a sadistic hope that he is not well.” Bennett replied: “Unfortunately for you, then, the President is doing amazing, thanks to this team of terrified doctors. As you heard from his primary physician, Dr. Handsome Liar, Trump is in peak physical condition.”
