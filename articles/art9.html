By Danya Issawi Until March, Gabriel and Constancia Merrill had both worked to provide food to seniors, she preparing the meals and he delivering them. But now, the couple has found themselves on the receiving end of food assistance after losing those jobs. “We’ve never gone to a food bank before,” Mr. Merrill, 71, said. “Now, we’re to the point where we can’t do anything. We never thought we would be in this situation at all.” Donate now to the 109th annual campaign of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. All proceeds go to 10 organizations providing assistance to those facing economic hardship. Make a tax-deductible donation through GoFundMe. Since their employer had to let them go in March because of curbed operations, the couple has survived off Social Security checks, and has yet to receive unemployment. To make ends meet, the Merrills have been visiting Adventist Community Services of Greater Washington, a pantry working with Capital Area Food Bank, a member of the Feeding America network. The Merrills are not alone. Before the coronavirus pandemic, more than 37 million Americans were considered food insecure by the government. A recent study from Feeding America projects that the number will rise significantly this year, as the coronavirus wreaks havoc on the most vulnerable populations’ livelihoods. “Our demand has skyrocketed,” said Radha Muthiah, the president and chief executive of the Capital Area Food Bank, one of 200 in the network of Feeding America, a beneficiary agency of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. “We’re now looking to serve just over 600,000 people, as opposed to the 400,000 that we were projecting before Covid.”
