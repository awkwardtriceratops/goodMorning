By Melina Delkic and Lucy Tompkins Attorney General Daniel Cameron of Kentucky said on Sunday that he had received a ballistics report on the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, calling it a “critical piece” of the investigation. Ms. Taylor, 26, was shot and killed in March when three police officers with a “no-knock” search warrant forced their way into her Louisville apartment without warning in the middle of the night. “It’s not the end-all be-all,” Mr. Cameron said of the report on the CBS program “Face the Nation.” “There are still some witness-testimony interviews that have to be conducted.” He said he would meet with F.B.I. agents this week for a “painstaking review” of the new information in the report. The shooting is being investigated by both the state authorities and the F.B.I. Mr. Cameron declined to say what the ballistics report found or what further information was needed before his office would make a decision about criminal charges in the case. “I don’t want to get into the specifics,” he said. “It is an ongoing investigation, and I don’t want to compromise it in any way.” He added that his office was “leaving no stone unturned.” David James, president of the Louisville Metro Council, said in an interview that although the ballistics report was an important element of the case, “it’s just a step along the path,” and did not signify that the investigation was nearing its end. The circumstances of the shooting and the investigation have fed into the widespread anger and protests across the nation over police use of deadly force, especially against Black people.
