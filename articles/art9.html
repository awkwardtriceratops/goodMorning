It Depends on the Measure<br></h1><p id="artcont">By different metrics, all sorts of locations in the United States are deeply troubling, from Minot, N.D., to New York City. By Mitch Smith, Amy Harmon, Lucy Tompkins and Thomas Fuller The coronavirus is tearing across the United States at a pace fiercer than ever. Hospitals are filled to perilous levels. More than 120,000 new cases are being identified every day. And ever higher and more miserable records — of states’ cases, of positive testing rates, of hospitalizations — are being set, day after day. A pandemic that was once raging in New York and later across the Sun Belt is now spread so widely across the country that any number of cities and states might now be considered the worst off, depending on the measurement used. The Minot, N.D., area has seen more cases per capita in this upsurge than anywhere in the country. Wisconsin’s outbreak has escalated more rapidly than those in other states. The county that includes Los Angeles has reported more Covid-19 cases since the pandemic’s start than anywhere else. Texas has the most cases of any state, and the most cases reported on college campuses. The list of deeply troubled locations — each with its own, different gauge of the problem — goes on and on. If anything, the sheer number of hot spots comes as a reminder of how widespread this outbreak has grown. “The entire country is out of control,” said Dr. Dara Kass, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York who treated numerous Covid-19 patients this spring and had the virus herself. “When you see the Dakotas and Montana and Oklahoma and Utah and Iowa and Texas — all these states — overrun with cases, it’s jarring to know that no matter what we do here, it’s going to depend on the action or inaction of leadership and people everywhere else.” Here is a snapshot at some of the places in the country that might be considered the most trouble-prone when it comes to Covid-19. The metro area with the most recent cases per capita. It is not immediately obvious in Minot, a city of 47,000 that is known for its Air Force base, that a spike of virus cases is unfolding. Schools are proceeding in person and indoor dining, though limited, is still allowed. But inside Trinity Hospital, a crisis is clear. Doctors and nurses are working overtime to care for the rapidly increasing number of coronavirus patients. An entire hospital floor — 35 beds — is dedicated to Covid-19 patients, but hospital officials say it is not enough and an expansion is being considered, as other large hospitals in the state are full and unable to help. “It’s very scary,” said Lisa Clute, a public heath official in Minot. “One day my mom called and she said, ‘I lost three friends last night to Covid.’ It’s heartbreaking. I just don’t know how else to say it.” The metro area that may have faced the most prolonged suffering. Other places have had bigger outbreaks, worse days and faster surges. But few have seen the sustained pain of the Sioux City, Iowa, metro area. It has had more known cases per capita than any metro area except Bismarck, N.D., according to a New York Times analysis. Nearly 9 percent of people in the area, known to locals as Siouxland, have tested positive. The troubles started this spring, when outbreaks at meatpacking plants sickened hundreds of people. After a relatively quiet summer, infections have started rising again, with daily case levels across the Sioux City metro area exceeding 180 a day, almost as many as at the May peak. School officials have said they could soon ask the state for permission to close some buildings. Mayor Bob Scott said pretty much everyone at an outdoor Veterans Day event was wearing a mask, a level of compliance he would not have expected even a few weeks ago. But the struggle has been so prolonged, and so relentless, that Mr. Scott said he did not think most people in Sioux City realized their area had one of the country’s highest case rates. “It’s been so gradual,” he said, “that we’ve just sort of learned how to live with it.” The big city with the highest death toll. In New York City, the U.S. center of the pandemic in its first dark months this spring, there is a distinct feeling of post-traumatic stress disorder as the number of new infections rise to a level — more than 1,000 cases a day — that last occurred in May. “A second wave is knocking at the door,” Bill Neidhardt, the press secretary for Mayor Bill de Blasio, tweeted on Wednesday morning. More than 24,000 deaths in New York City have been linked to the virus, more than in any other American city. And even as hospitalizations and death rates remain at a small fraction of what they were at their height, the sound of ambulance sirens can touch off a sense of dread. “It’s a scary time,” said David Lat, a 45-year-old lawyer who chronicled his hospitalization in March on Twitter. “Everyone is worried about another spike.” The county with the most known cases since the start of the pandemic. Phones lit up across Los Angeles this week with an emergency alert: Coronavirus infections were on the rise after months of remaining steady. Los Angeles County is seeing daily case counts at levels not seen since the late summer. “This isn’t a blip,” Barbara Ferrer, the county public health director, said. “This is now a surge.” Los Angeles County, with 10 million people, is more populous than most states and has seen more known cases than any other county: 326,000. Factoring for population, its numbers look far different. On a per capita basis, nine California counties have more cases. The biggest known cluster. Avenal State Prison, in California’s San Joaquin Valley, is the nation’s largest known coronavirus cluster of any kind, with at least 3,314 infected inmates and correctional officers over the course of the pandemic, according to the Times database. Eight inmates have died. As of Wednesday, more than 85 percent of the prison’s inmates had tested positive, according to state prison data. Twenty inmates remained ill. A spokeswoman for the California prison system did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
