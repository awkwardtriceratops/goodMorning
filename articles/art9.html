By Victoria Shannon and Karen Cetinkaya (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump is holding a rally on the White House lawn tomorrow, his first public appearance since he returned home on Monday from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for treatment for the coronavirus. Trailing Joe Biden in the polls, the president had originally hoped to travel to in-person rallies this weekend. He is now also planning to attend an event in Florida on Monday. Mr. Biden, shown above at his own campaign stop in Las Vegas today, said only an “overwhelming” election win could counter Mr. Trump’s efforts to undermine trust in the election results. The White House, seeking to revive stimulus talks that Mr. Trump called off just days ago, is preparing a $1.8 trillion economic relief proposal. But the prospect of a compromise with Democratic lawmakers before the election remains remote. 2. The president engineered a financial windfall in 2016, as his campaign funds dwindled. Mr. Trump’s long-hidden tax records, obtained by The New York Times, show that he engineered the more than $21 million in one-time payments from the Las Vegas hotel he owns with his friend Phil Ruffin, the casino mogul. The two are pictured above in 2005. The payments, which experts describe as highly unusual, were routed through other Trump companies and paid out in cash. The tax records, by their nature, do not specify whether the payments from the hotel helped prop up Mr. Trump’s campaign, his businesses or both. If the payments, which were claimed as business expenses, were not legitimate and were also used to fund Mr. Trump’s presidential run, they could be considered illegal campaign contributions. 3. Hurricane Delta is nearing Louisiana, with landfall expected this evening. Life is still not back to normal along a wide swath of the northern Gulf Coast, which was battered by Laura in late August and by Sally in September. Louisiana has been in the path of six major storms since June. Delta, the 25th named storm of a busy 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, could arrive with 100 mile-an-hour winds but is expected to weaken after it moves inland. It is still forecast to produce as much as 15 inches of rain through Saturday. Schools were closed and evacuations,  were underway, including in Lake Charles, La., above. 4. Labels warning about false information on Twitter will begin to appear in timelines next week. And when users want to retweet a post from another account, they will essentially get a timeout, in the form of a prompt that will nudge them to add their own comment or context. It’s one of a handful of changes the social media platform is imposing in an attempt to control the spread of misinformation in the final weeks before the presidential election — and the move risks attracting the ire of its best-known user, President Trump. Twitter officials said the “extra friction” was designed to “encourage everyone to not only consider why they are amplifying a tweet, but also increase the likelihood that people add their own thoughts, reactions and perspectives to the conversation.” The change is likely to have a direct impact on Mr. Trump’s online activity. On Tuesday evening alone, he tweeted or retweeted posts from other accounts about 40 times.
