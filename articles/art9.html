A motive for the shootings, which injured one person, was unknown. By Maria Cramer A driver for UPS was arrested on Thursday in connection with a series of shootings along a highway in southwest Oregon that injured one person and unnerved motorists, officials said. The Oregon State Police identified the gunman as Kenneth Ayers, 49, of Roseburg, Ore., a city about 70 miles south of Eugene. The police said he fired at cars from a UPS tractor-trailer on seven separate occasions starting in May. The shootings, which were spread across three counties, ended on Thursday, one day after a woman driving on Interstate 5 was shot. She was treated at a hospital and released, the police said. Officials said they immediately found the tractor-trailer about 60 miles north of the shooting. They did not say what led them to the tractor-trailer. “The search of the truck revealed a firearm consistent with the type used,” the police said.
