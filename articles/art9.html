But can you trust its sources? By Allie Jones Did you hear the scoop about Chris Evans? When the 39-year-old actor goes to the local sandwich shop in his Massachusetts hometown, he always orders the same thing: a ham sandwich. Allegedly. An anonymous source recently claimed that Mr. Evans asks for “pickles, tomatoes, a little mustard, and extra mayo” on wheat, with salt and vinegar chips on the side, and he “always puts money in the tip jar.” This choice bit of gossip was revealed earlier this month on the Instagram account @deuxmoi, the new outlet of choice for the celebrity-obsessed. Run by an anonymous New York City woman, Deuxmoi has exploded in popularity this year by sharing both scandalous and shockingly mundane updates about the A-list on the platform’s Stories feature. This user-submitted gossip disappears after 24 hours, making it all the more important for interested parties to click through on a daily basis. In addition to Mr. Evans’s sandwich preferences, Deuxmoi has posted anonymous tips in recent weeks about Timothée Chalamet’s coffee order, Lionel Richie’s tipping habits and Jennifer Lopez’s preferred dessert (one bite of creme brulee). The account also breaks news: When Carl Lentz, the Hillsong pastor famous for ministering to Justin Bieber, was fired on Nov. 4 for “moral failures,” Deuxmoi was the first to post a statement from church leadership. Perhaps it would surprise you to learn, then, that the woman behind the account is not a tabloid obsessive. She previously used Deuxmoi to promote a lifestyle site that she started with a friend in 2013. When the pair stopped publishing content to the site (“around 2015”), she kept the account, which had about 45,000 followers. Then, in March, she got bored. “It was the day that I got sent home from work and knew that we were going to be quarantined for an indefinite amount of time,” she said. “I think it was March 18. I just sort of threw out a question: ‘You guys have any celeb encounters that you want to share?’ And that’s literally how it started.” The first tip that came in was about Leonardo DiCaprio. Then there was one about Jonah Hill. Then, she said, one of Mr. Hill’s ex-girlfriends started DMing her. She started posting screenshots of the messages from her followers, and the account took off. The account’s administrator said she gets hundreds of submissions a week through her Instagram DMs and a form on her website. (The New York Times agreed to grant the administrator anonymity due to her concerns for privacy and safety.) Given that volume, she said, she does not have any personal photos stored on her phone. “All screenshots.” Sometimes, if the information is particularly sensitive, she will alter the text to make it a blind item. But she is clear that she does not spend time attempting to verify each story. Or any story. This hasn’t stopped other celebrity news and gossip outlets, like The Daily Mail and LaineyGossip, from citing her account. “I’ve always stayed true to what I said from day one, which is that this information is not proven to be based in fact,” she said. “I don’t do any additional research. I’m not a reporter.” She simply takes a screenshot of a source’s message and reposts it, sometimes blurring out identifying details. “I feel like my content is as truthful as the person who’s sending it in,” she said. “Like, I don’t edit. I will censor, but I don’t edit. So you’re seeing exactly what somebody is writing to me.”
