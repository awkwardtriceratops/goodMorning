By Reuters CAIRO — King Salman of Saudi Arabia fired two members of the royal family and referred them, along with four military officers, for investigation into corruption at the defense ministry, according to a royal decree issued early on Tuesday and carried by state news media. The decree said Prince Fahd bin Turki bin Abdulaziz Al Saud would be removed as commander of joint forces in the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, and his son, Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd, would be relieved of his post as deputy governor of al-Jouf region. It said the decision was based on Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s call for an anticorruption committee to investigate “suspicious financial transactions at the defense ministry.” After becoming heir to the throne in 2017, Prince Mohammed began an anticorruption campaign that saw scores of royals, ministers and businessmen detained at Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton Hotel. Most were released after reaching undisclosed settlements with the state. The young prince has made fighting corruption a pillar of his reforms. Critics saw the purge as a power grab by the crown prince, who has moved to sideline any rivals to his eventual succession to the throne, take control of the country’s security apparatus and crack down on dissent. The authorities wound down the Ritz campaign after 15 months but said the government would continue to go after graft by state employees. In March, the authorities arrested nearly 300 government officials, including military and security officers, on charges involving bribery and exploiting public office.
