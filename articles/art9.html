Here are the highs and lows of the ceremony. By The New York Times With the pandemic making packed red carpets and large, glitzy gatherings impossible, almost no one knew what the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony would look like going into Sunday night’s telecast. Turns out it reflected what much of life has looked like for the past six months or so: People sequestered in their homes, interacting awkwardly over glitchy broadband connections. Along the way, there were awards show hallmarks, like a monologue from a tuxedoed host (albeit in a mostly empty arena), some stilted banter, bits that fell flat and a few moments of genuine poignancy. But in general, the 2020 Emmys, like most of us, did the best it could under extraordinarily challenging circumstances. Here are some of the night’s defining themes, shows and moments. — JEREMY EGNER It was a disorienting opener for disorienting times. Jimmy Kimmel, the ceremony’s host, initially seemed to be delivering a fairly routine opening monologue, with pauses for laughter and cuts to the star-studded audience. “You know what they say,” he began. “You can’t have a virus without a host.” But the applause? Fake. The cuts to the crowd? Those were clips filmed during past awards shows. After a few minutes, Kimmel dropped the ruse as cameras revealed an empty Staples Center: “Of course we don’t have an audience,” he said. “This isn’t a MAGA rally.” The seats weren’t entirely empty, though. Spread among the front rows were life-size cutouts of several nominees, who in any other year would have attended the ceremony. Among them, however, was the real Jason Bateman, sitting stock-still and trying to pass for cardboard. “I haven’t left the house for six months,” he pleaded when Kimmel advised him to leave for safety reasons. “I want Mario Lopez to ask me about my pants.” — SOPAN DEB
