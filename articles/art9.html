Here’s your guide to Day 2. By Maggie Astor As of 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, seven states that will decide the next president remained uncalled, as did a handful of Senate races that will determine who controls the chamber. Here’s where things stand, when you can expect final results, and how to follow along today as this extraordinary election unfolds. In the presidential race, as of 3:30 p.m. Eastern time, we did not yet know who won Alaska (3 electoral votes), Arizona (11), Georgia (16), Michigan (16), Nevada (6), North Carolina (15) or Pennsylvania (20). With two new calls — Wisconsin for Joseph R. Biden Jr., and Maine’s Second Congressional District for President Trump — Mr. Biden has 237 confirmed electoral votes and would need 33 more to win. President Trump has 214 confirmed electoral votes and would need 56 more to win. Five Senate races were uncalled in four states: Alaska, Georgia, Michigan and North Carolina. A sixth race, in Maine, was called Wednesday afternoon for the Republican incumbent, Senator Susan Collins. Georgia has two races, both involving Republican incumbents whom Democrats hope to unseat. One, between Senator David Perdue and Jon Ossoff, might be decided in the next few days or might go to a runoff in January, depending on whether a Libertarian candidate gets enough votes to keep both major-party candidates below 50 percent. The other race will require a runoff between the incumbent, Kelly Loeffler, and Raphael Warnock, a Democrat. This will probably vary significantly from state to state. Let’s take them one at a time. Alaska may well be the last state to be called, because officials there won’t even begin counting mail ballots, or early in-person ballots cast after Oct. 29, for another week. That being said, it’s a red state and isn’t really competitive. Mr. Trump will probably win here pretty easily, and Senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican, probably will too. Arizona may be called Wednesday night. Mr. Biden is leading by five percentage points with more than 80 percent of the estimated vote counted, and some news outlets, including The Associated Press and Fox News, have already called it for him. The New York Times and others have not done so, but Arizona officials are expected to provide updated vote totals at 9 p.m. Eastern time.
