By Max Gendler How to watch: From noon to 5 p.m. Eastern time on ESPN, from 5 to 8 p.m. on ESPN2 and from 8 to 11 p.m. back on ESPN; streaming on ESPN+ and ESPN3. The United States Open singles first round continues on Tuesday with a plethora of experienced veterans and exciting young players starting their campaigns toward the top of the ladder. Beyond tournament favorites like Serena Williams and Daniil Medvedev, there are plenty of exciting players to watch. Because of the number of matches cycling through courts, the times for individual matchups are at best estimates and certain to fluctuate based on the completion time of earlier play. All times are Eastern. ARTHUR ASHE STADIUM | NOON Andy Murray, a three-time Grand Slam winner, was last seen on the main stage of the singles world at the 2019 Australian Open. At the time, he was faced with a hip surgery that had the potential to end his career. Now Murray, 115th in the ATP singles rankings, has pushed himself back onto the tour with a vengeance. Last week, at the Western and Southern Open, Murray beat Alexander Zverev, the fifth seed at this year’s U.S. Open, on his way to the round of 16. Although Murray, 33, is not performing at his peak, his relentless defensive efforts have been on display since his return, and he will look to make a deep run. Yoshihito Nishioka, the world No. 49, is going to be a difficult opponent for Murray. Nishioka, at just 5-foot-7, frustrates opponents primarily by extending rallies and digging into stalwart defensive positions while redirecting his opponent’s pace rather than generating his own. Although both players’ fitness levels could be questioned after such a long break from the professional tour, the younger Nishioka, 24, may have the edge in this best-of-five format. ARTHUR ASHE STADIUM | 7 P.M. Karolina Muchova, the 20th seed, won her first WTA title last year at the Korea Open, but that success did not continue into 2020. With a 3-5 record this year, Muchova is in need of a fresh start. Although her performance against Naomi Osaka in the second round of the Western and Southern Open last week showed some glimmers of her potential, she struggled to control points with her ball placement against an opponent who is a proponent of power tennis.
