By The Editorial Board The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. The abrupt departure of a strong and long-serving leader is always a time of both anxiety and hope. The comforts of stability and familiarity are shaken, but there is the potential to right wrongs and breathe new life into the nation. Shinzo Abe’s unexpected announcement on Friday that he was stepping down after two stints as Japan’s prime minister, totaling eight and a half years, is just such a moment. Mr. Abe’s greatest achievement was to bring stability to a government that had known seven prime ministers in seven years before him, and he used his firm control over the governing Liberal Democratic Party to begin a number of critically needed economic and social reforms. He put in place aggressive expansionary economic policies — referred to as Abenomics — that initially helped propel growth, employment and corporate earnings. He challenged how Japan did business, expanding the participation of women and immigrants in a deeply conservative society and shaking up the nation’s hidebound boardroom culture. Mr. Abe advanced the notion that Japan needed to be a “normal country” by taking more responsibility for its own defense and signing free-trade deals with the European Union and the countries that remained in the Trans-Pacific Partnership after President Trump withdrew the United States. He consistently stressed the need to rein in North Korea. He also somehow managed to be one of the few foreign democratic leaders to maintain something of a rapport with Mr. Trump, thus keeping — in the words of an editorial in The Japan Times — “a tempestuous Donald Trump from wreaking too much havoc on the Japan-U.S. relationship.”
