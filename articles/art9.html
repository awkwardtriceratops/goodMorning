With much of the world, and especially New York City, reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, they had no idea where or when the Open might take place, or if anyone would bother to show up for an event held in the city for more than 100 years, one of its biggest and most economically important festivals. So Mike Dowse, the newly installed chief executive of the United States Tennis Association, set up a team to determine how to carry out the event, setting in motion a grand experiment that could show what international sports, as well as New York, might be capable of while navigating the public health threat. Players, who began arriving in mid-August for a smaller tournament held before the U.S. Open begins on Monday, are mostly cloistered in a Long Island hotel, prohibited even from sharing an outdoor table with friends and preparing to play in cavernous stadiums without spectators at the U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens. These athletes, who are used to the ultimate in pampering are doubling as guinea pigs, watched by medical experts, leaders of other sports and public health officials curious about what version of normal might be possible in the nation’s largest city as it hosts its first major sporting event since the pandemic began. “This is such a — hopefully — once-in-a-generation experience,” Dowse said during an interview last week. “It’s a chance to be a part of history.” It is also an opportunity to provide a new set of data points for the sputtering sports and live events world still trying to figure out how to survive until there is a vaccine. “It’s been a fascinating experiment in human behavior that has made me realize that human beings are really social creatures,” said Dr. Bernard Camins, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Health Systems who advised the U.S.T.A. on its protocols. “It’s really hard to tell people to stay away from your friends who you have not seen in five months, or for me to tell them you can’t say ‘hi’ or hug or shake hands with them or even be within six feet of them if you’re not wearing a mask.” Dr. Camins said having athletes arrive from all over the world made staging the tournament especially complicated. Officials quickly determined that if they required a two-week quarantine period ahead of the tournament, no one would come. They decided instead to administer two tests within the first 48 hours and follow up on testing every four days. Also, the U.S.T.A. leaned into education, trying to teach players the best ways to avoid becoming infected. There was a lengthy debate about protocols for massages — both athlete and masseur have to wear masks and an eye shield, not the most relaxing experience. Allowing spectators was never a realistic consideration, and probably will not be for a long time, Dr. Camins said. The Open is under pressure to prove a success; the New York sports calendar is heating up. After the tennis tournament ends on Sept. 13, the world’s top golfers will arrive in the New York area for their sport’s U.S. Open, which will be held at Winged Foot Golf Club in Westchester County, also without fans. By October, the Yankees will have a good shot at the playoffs. Later in the year, the N.H.L. and the N.B.A., home to five teams in the region, want to start playing in home arenas again. The New York City Marathon, which is usually held in November, was canceled but New York Road Runners, the event’s organizer, is going to begin scheduling races in September and October. “Pacing is really important,” said Michael Capiraso, chief executive of New York Road Runners, who sits on a committee with other civic leaders trying to figure out how to hold public events again. “The city wants to start bringing back events, slowly and safely,” he said, adding, “I’m really curious to see what comes out of the tennis. We’re all learning from each other.” The stakes are not small for a city where major events are routine. In a normal year, the U.S. Open tennis tournament generates some $400 million for the U.S.T.A. and an estimated $750 million in economic activity, according to a study commissioned by the U.S.T.A. It took city health officials months to get comfortable with the idea of holding the U.S. Open. They became convinced that the U.S.T.A. had done its homework, and the tennis organization also was committed to developing a comprehensive contact tracing program. “A living experiment, that is exactly how our eyes are viewing this,” said Dr. Andrew Wallach, chief medical officer for ambulatory care for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp. “What we are going to learn from the tournaments is a little different than a football game, but we are going to learn about preparedness and testing protocols and tracing in a sporting event.” Wallach said discussions grew so specific they even included details about who sits where on a bus, preparing city officials for conversations about the specifics of bringing other events to New York.
