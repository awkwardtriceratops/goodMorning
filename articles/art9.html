Novak Djokovic Is in His Way.<br></h1><p id="artcont">If Nadal defeats Djokovic on Sunday for his 13th championship at Roland Garros, he will match Roger Federer’s 20 singles titles in Grand Slam tournaments. By Christopher Clarey It should come as no surprise, even in autumn and in the midst of a pandemic, that Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic will meet in another French Open final. Djokovic is No. 1 and has not lost a completed match in this disjointed 2020 tennis season. Nadal is No. 2 and the greatest clay-court player in the game’s long history. Nadal will be aiming for his 13th French Open title, a preposterous figure at any event, much less a Grand Slam tournament. Djokovic is aiming for his second. Both advanced on Friday with victories over younger men who had reason to hope for better. Nadal won, 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (0), against No. 12 seed Diego Schwartzman, who upset him on clay in the Italian Open last month. Djokovic won, 6-3, 6-2, 5-7, 4-6, 6-1, against No. 5 Stefanos Tsitsipas, who already had beaten him twice and who pushed him to five sets this time before his legs, if not his will, gave out. But Sunday’s showdown — the 56th match in the rich rivalry between Nadal and Djokovic, and their third meeting in the French Open final — will be about more than winning this unique October edition of Roland Garros.
