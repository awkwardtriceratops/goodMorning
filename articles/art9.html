But after one idea was scrapped, she found a way to make it work. By Kyle Buchanan Disney’s live-action take on “Mulan” has no need for songs or wisecracking dragons, but there is still one notable holdover from the 1998 animated version that inspired it: Ming-Na Wen, the actress who originally voiced Mulan, appears at the end of the new film in a cameo role. After the villain’s plot is foiled and the brave warrior Mulan (played by Yifei Liu) reveals her gender to the troops she fought alongside while dressed as a man, she is brought to the throne room of the emperor for a celebration. That’s when Wen comes in, oh so briefly: Billed in the credits as “Esteemed Guest,” she introduces Mulan to the emperor, bows and departs. Though it had been scheduled for a March 27 release in theaters before the pandemic, “Mulan” debuted on Disney+ over the weekend. Still, Wen delights in the reaction her surprise cameo got at the film’s premiere back in March, before Hollywood went into shutdown. “I hope even though it’s streaming, it can still have that impact,” she said in a phone call last week. Here are edited excerpts from our conversation. You heard through the grapevine that Disney is going to do a live-action “Mulan.” What happened next? It all started with the fans tweeting about it, saying, “You have to be a part of it!” I asked my manager and my agent if that would be a possibility because I thought that would be kind of fun. Then I met with the producer Jason Reed and he loved the idea, but at that time I was doing “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” so scheduling-wise, it was kind of a logistical nightmare because “Mulan” was shooting in New Zealand. They had written a scene for me to be a part of, but the schedule just didn’t work out. What was that going to be? I was going to be the potential mother-in-law for the matchmaker scene, but because of the weather, they needed me to be out there for a month just in case. The producers of “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” just threw up their hands: “We can’t lose you for a month!” I totally understood, and I’m always very Zen about this stuff. I said, “Look, if it was meant to me be, it was meant to be. We all tried, and it’s too bad.” So we sort of let it go, and then Jason and Niki [Caro, the director] came up with this great idea where instead of shooting an entire scene, I’d just make a cameo at the very end to announce Mulan to the emperor. I thought that was very appropriate and just wonderful, a little Easter egg where I could pass the baton. And this time, they only needed me there for a week. So it all worked out!
