By Richard C. Paddock BANGKOK — For two decades, Prabowo Subianto, a former Indonesian general, was a pariah in international affairs. Mr. Prabowo, once a son-in-law of the dictator Suharto, who died in 1998, and a past commander of Indonesia’s feared special forces, was blamed for atrocities committed by troops he had led. Under Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, he was prohibited from visiting the United States. But now, Mr. Prabowo is Indonesia’s minister of defense and the ban has been lifted. At the invitation of Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, Mr. Prabowo arrived in Washington this week and is expected to meet with top officials at the Pentagon on Thursday. For Mr. Prabowo, who will turn 69 on Saturday while on his trip, the visit is the culmination of a yearslong quest to gain respectability. For Washington, it highlights the significance of Indonesia, a potentially important U.S. ally against China, and further signals the relegation of human rights to a minor diplomatic concern. “The ban that applied to Minister Prabowo has been lifted, and he will visit the U.S. to discuss cooperation,” said Irawan Ronodipuro, a spokesman for Mr. Prabowo and his political party, Gerindra. Amnesty International and six other human rights groups called on the Trump administration to cancel the visit, saying that it could violate the United States’ own rules on the entry of people accused of human rights violations and would undermine efforts in Indonesia to hold abusers accountable. “Prabowo Subianto is a former Indonesian general who has been banned, since 2000, from entering the U.S., due to his alleged direct involvement in human rights violations,” the groups said in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “The State Department’s recent decision to lift the ban on Prabowo Subianto is an abrupt, complete reversal of longstanding U.S. foreign policy.” As commander of the country’s special forces under Suharto in the late 1990s, Mr. Prabowo was discharged from the army by a panel of generals for ordering the kidnapping of student activists in a failed effort to keep his father-in-law in power. Mr. Prabowo was also accused of atrocities in East Timor, a former province that broke away in 1999 and became independent in 2002. After Suharto stepped down, ending more than three decades of kleptocratic rule, Mr. Prabowo was unceremoniously discharged from the army on charges of repeatedly breaking the law, violating human rights and disobeying orders. However, like other high-ranking officials accused of committing atrocities and rights violations, he was never charged or put on trial. To the dismay of human rights advocates, he and others accused of abuses received important posts in subsequent democratically elected governments and have never been held accountable. Mr. Prabowo, who once saw himself as a possible successor to his father-in-law, made four unsuccessful attempts to win election as president of Indonesia, the most recent in 2019. In a surprise move, the president who twice defeated him, Joko Widodo, named him minister of defense a year ago this month. Mr. Joko’s apparent goal in appointing him was to build support among the major political parties in Parliament as he pushed through his economic agenda. Less than two months later, Mr. Prabowo hired a Washington lobbyist, James N. Frinzi, to represent him, according to a form Mr. Frinzi filed under the United States Foreign Agents Registration Act. The document provides no information about the purpose of his lobbying.
