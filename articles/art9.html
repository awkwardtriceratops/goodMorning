By Austin Ramzy and Elaine Yu HONG KONG — The Hong Kong police on Tuesday arrested a 19-year-old activist outside the United States consulate just as he was about to seek asylum, according to an advocacy group. The activist, Tony Chung, had previously been arrested in July under a national security law imposed on the city by Beijing earlier this year. He was accused of posting a message on social media about a new political party that called for Hong Kong’s independence from China. Mr. Chung has denied writing it. Mr. Chung had been planning to enter the consulate and ask for protection when he was arrested at a coffee shop across the street, said Friends of Hong Kong, an activist group based in Britain that said it was helping Mr. Chung. The South China Morning Post posted a video that appeared to show Mr. Chung being led away by a group of men in plain clothes near the consulate. A consulate spokesman said he had no immediate comment. Two of Mr. Chung’s associates, Yanni Ho and William Chan, were also detained on Tuesday, according to Studentlocalism, a group that Mr. Chung helped found, which posted a message on its Facebook page. The police confirmed that three people had been arrested for allegedly inciting secession, though it did not identify the individuals.
