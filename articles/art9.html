By Christina Morales and Allyson Waller As President Trump continues to be treated at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, doctors and senior White House staff members have given conflicting updates about the president’s condition, treatments and when he learned he was infected with the coronavirus. A timeline of events about the president’s illness is drawn from his tweets, news conferences, statements from the White House and reporting from The New York Times. Mr. Trump and his team traveled to Minnesota for a rally that lasted about 45 minutes — about half the length of his typical campaign speeches. During the event, one of Mr. Trump’s closest advisers, Hope Hicks, started to have symptoms related to the virus. On the return trip, Mr. Trump slept as some of his advisers spoke about the condition of Ms. Hicks, who was isolated in the back of the plane. News that Ms. Hicks tested positive for the virus came as Mr. Trump left the White House by helicopter around 1 p.m. for a fund-raiser at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. At the event, Mr. Trump appeared before hundreds of supporters, both indoors and outdoors. One person who saw the president there said he was in contact with about 100 people and appeared lethargic. On a call with Iowa voters and in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, Mr. Trump sounded raspy. Later that night, Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said. The president had a mild cough, nasal congestion and fatigue. Close to 1 a.m., Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he and the first lady had tested positive for the coronavirus. Later in the morning, Mr. Trump had a high fever and his oxygen saturation levels dipped below 94 percent, Dr. Sean Conley, the White House physician, said. The doctor recommended that Mr. Trump be given supplemental oxygen.
