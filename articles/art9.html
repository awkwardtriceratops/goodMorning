By Simon Romero and Patricia Mazzei The U.S. Virgin Islands is halting tourism for a month, hoping against hope to keep out new cases of the coronavirus. Puerto Rico’s Senate is closed after several high-ranking officials came down with Covid-19. Hawaii is facing a surge in new infections. Guam is enduring its most restrictive lockdown since the pandemic began. For months, United States islands in the Caribbean and the Pacific avoided much of the agony unleashed by the coronavirus across parts of the mainland, due in part to their early mitigation efforts and relative ease in sealing off borders. But now the state of Hawaii and these territories are emerging as some of the most alarming virus hot spots in the United States, revealing how the coronavirus can spike and then rapidly spread in places with relaxed restrictions, sluggish contact tracing and widespread pressure to end the economic pain that comes with lockdowns. “People are infecting each other in crowded apartments while hotels sit empty,” Dr. Jonathan Dworkin, an infectious-diseases doctor who lives on Hawaii’s Big Island, wrote in a scathing assessment of Hawaii’s pandemic responses in The Honolulu Star-Advertiser. Dr. Dworkin lit into the reluctance by health officials in Hawaii to ramp up testing in the early weeks of the pandemic and said it was the privately funded testing efforts that may have staved off an even more acute crisis. He also questioned why contact tracing operations remain inadequately staffed. Hawaii, as well as other some islands that are U.S. territories, still have relatively fewer cases and Covid-19-related deaths than many parts of the mainland. But Hawaii now ranks among the states where new cases have grown fastest over the last 14 days.
