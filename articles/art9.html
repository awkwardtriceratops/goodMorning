By David M. Halbfinger JERUSALEM — An Israeli teenager has said that she was gang-raped during a visit to the resort city of Eilat, and one of the accused has said that as many as 30 men joined in the attack, shocking the nation as police officers began rounding up suspects. Two 27-year-old men from northern Israel were in custody by midday Thursday, the police said, and a special investigation team was gathering surveillance images, cellphone data and other evidence to try to identify other potential suspects. Israel has been through repeated rounds of soul-searching over cases of sexual assault in recent years, but the Aug. 12 attack, news of which broke late Wednesday, quickly overtook the national conversation. The sheer number of men involved, attributed to a lawyer for one of the two suspects arrested, ignited a storm of outrage. One of Thursday’s noon news broadcasts opened by playing a somber Israeli pop song about group sexual assault, “The Whole Gang,” then adapted the lyrics to reflect the Eilat victim’s account. On Twitter, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attack was “not only a crime against the girl, this is a crime against humanity itself that is worthy of all condemnation and those responsible must be brought to justice.” Aida Touma-Suleiman, a lawmaker and longtime advocate against violence against women, called the reports chilling: “The evil is inconceivable,” she said. And Benny Gantz, the defense minister, wrote in a series of Twitter posts that he had been “trying, and failing, to understand: What is a man who is standing on a crowded line with dozens of others, on the way to a room where a young, disoriented girl is lying down, trying to prove?” Addressing the unnamed 16-year-old complainant, Mr. Gantz added: “My heart is with you, you are not alone.” Orit Sulitzeanu, director of the Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel, said the number of attackers was horrifying but beside the point. “It’s a bigger issue,” she said. “Gang rape is just a manifestation of something very bad going on here,” calling it part of a “rotten culture.” The association’s hotlines have been receiving an average of 250 calls from victims of gang rape each year since they started keeping count in 2014, 55 percent of them from teenagers. In 2018, the group received 192 such calls, its records show. But the police reported only 19 complaints of gang rape that year, 12 of them from minors. Ms. Sulitzeanu said that many victims decline to file police reports out of shame and stigma, but that a greater deterrent was the slim chance of an attacker being brought to justice: Nine out of 10 rapists go unpunished, and 84 percent of rape cases are closed without being prosecuted. Overcrowded courts have forced prosecutors to pursue only the most surefire criminal charges, she said: “They want to be positive they’ll win or they close the file.” In one recent case, an 11-year-old girl said she was raped by several older boys last year, and the attack was captured on video, but prosecutors recently closed the case after failing to determine who had made the video. Sexual assault cases are on the rise in Israel in general, according to Ms. Sulitzeanu’s group, with the number of complaints to the police climbing 15 percent from 2013 to 2018, and the number of calls to the group’s hotlines up 40 percent in the period. Ms. Sulitzeanu said she believed that Israeli students were not being properly taught about consent. “It’s not compulsory, it depends on the teacher and the school principal,” she said. “They don’t do it, because these kinds of subjects aren’t easy, they’re embarrassing.” On Thursday, the education minister, Yoav Galant, said he had ordered that sexual-violence prevention programs be made mandatory in schools in the coming year. “We will take action so that every boy and girl in Israel has a deep understanding of the boundaries of what is permissible and what is forbidden,” he said, according to Ynet. After the Aug. 12 attack, a police spokeswoman, Nava Dihi, cautioned that investigators had not yet established the number of attackers, and that it was possible that some people present had not taken part. Still, just being present could be a crime, she stressed.
