Studies Don’t.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Lorrie Jackson sorting parts at Clips & Clamps, a Michigan company that was flooded with applications for an opening last year.Credit...Sylvia Jarrus for The New York Times Supported by By Patricia Cohen When Clips & Clamps, a metal forming company in Plymouth, Mich., advertised for a die setter and operator last year, more than a hundred applications came sailing in. This summer, the company sought to hire another operator, offering $17 to $22 an hour and benefits. After three months, not a single person had responded. “I received zero applicants,” said Jeff Aznavorian, the company’s president. “I’ve been dumbfounded.” Mr. Aznavorian, whose grandmother founded the company 66 years ago, has no clear explanation for his hiring troubles. In the Detroit area, there should be plenty of qualified candidates, he said. And Michigan’s unemployment rate was 8.7 percent in July, more than double what it was last summer. “I’m guessing it has something to do with the extra benefits associated with unemployment,” he said. The $600-a-week jobless benefit supplement that Congress approved in March as part of the CARES Act has been widely credited by economists with keeping the economy functioning through the coronavirus pandemic. Households used the extra cash to pay rent, buy food and cover medical, utility and credit card bills when many businesses abruptly shut and cars lined up for miles at food banks. With the supplement, which ended in July, most unemployed workers got more than they had earned in wages; without it, they fell short of their previous income. So did the supplement simply provide a lifeline, or did it discourage people from taking jobs? The answer has consequences for tens of millions of Americans, particularly those on the lower end of the income ladder; for businesses trying to restore their operations; and for an economy that largely depends on the lifeblood of consumer spending. There has been striking agreement among conservative and liberal economists who have studied the issue that the $600 supplement has deterred few workers from accepting a job. But the relief is not only a matter of contention among business owners; it is also at the center of an acrimonious debate in Congress that has held up agreement on a new aid package. Democrats insisted on extending the full $600 payment beyond July, while Republicans pushed for no more than $200, arguing that the extra income deterred people from working. Faced with the standoff, President Trump decided to use federal disaster relief funds to give most jobless workers $300 a week, but officials said the funds would cover only four or five weeks of payments. The issue is likely to continue to resonate through the election campaign. For most people collecting unemployment benefits, there are simply no jobs. Roughly half of the 22 million jobs that evaporated with the coronavirus outbreak have not yet returned. Freelancers, gig workers, the self-employed and others have also seen their contracts and incomes shrink. But what about those who declined to return to a previous job, or take a new one? Turning down a job offer to stay on unemployment insurance is considered fraud and is grounds for losing all jobless benefits. But many states suspended verification checks, and with the flood of claims, keeping track of applicants’ job searching can be difficult. So can determining the reason for declining a job. A lack of child care or health concerns related to Covid-19 are generally considered acceptable excuses. Making more money on unemployment insurance is not. On a gut level, the Republicans’ argument makes sense. With the supplement, nearly seven in 10 jobless workers got a bigger payment from the government than from their previous employer, according to one study. On its face, choosing to get more money and not work seems more appealing than settling for less and working. That’s the way Carl Livesay, vice president for operations of Maryland Thermoform in Baltimore, sees it. Before the pandemic, the low unemployment rate made hiring a struggle, but now, even with high unemployment rates, he said, “it’s worse than it’s ever been.” He has been trying to hire eight people as entry-level machine operators or warehouse workers, paying $12 to $15 an hour. “Only about 50 percent show up for the interview,” Mr. Livesay said. “Only 50 percent of those that we hire actually show up for work the first day. And of those, 25 percent don’t make it through the first week.” When he called his 60 employees back to work in early May, he said, some were worried about taking public transportation, so he offered to pay for a round trip by Uber until they felt comfortable. Mr. Livesay, who is on Gov. Larry Hogan’s task force to reopen manufacturing, said he had instituted a range of safety and sanitation measures to protect his workers. As far as he knows, only one employee, a single father, has been unable to return because of child care responsibilities. Mr. Livesay is convinced that the $600 supplement made it harder to hire.
