Now, What’s Your Risk Tolerance?<br></h1><p id="artcont">If we want to get out of our bunkers, we need to take stock of how much risk we can live with. By Elisabeth Rosenthal Dr. Rosenthal is a contributing Opinion writer. As some parts of America gingerly begin to open up after months of near total lockdown, people have questions. Will it be safe to take a train? A plane? Visit the hair salon? An indoor restaurant? There are many knowable parameters in the equation: your health; the prevalence of cases where you live; the safety precautions being taken any place you want to visit. But the final answer may depend on your individual risk tolerance for exposure to infectious disease. Most Americans alive today have never before had to make that self-assessment. In the past, deadly outbreaks of plague, flu and polio were regular occurrences. Up until the mid to late 20th century there were mumps, measles and chickenpox to contend with. In a world of effective antibiotics and antivirals and other treatments, deaths or even serious illnesses from infectious disease seem nearly incomprehensible. So our fear is enormous, and our risk tolerance for exposure is just about zero. I hear too many people saying “I’m not going back to life until there’s a vaccine” — as if that will immediately eliminate the risk. It won’t. Even if one of the current vaccine candidates works, it could be quite a while before it’s widely distributed. And to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it has to protect only half of the people who take it from infection. For the foreseeable future we will be living in a world with some level of coronavirus out there. So if we want to get out of our bunkers, we all need to take stock of our risk tolerance. As a doctor, I worked in a New York City emergency room and in a remote coastal clinic in Kenya, and then I became a journalist covering disease. I’ve had to measure my risk tolerance for infection in different situations. Once, collecting blood from an AIDs patient, I couldn’t feel the artery through my glove. The glove came off. Treating a patient with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, I pulled my surgical mask a little tighter, made sure the windows were open and — irrationally — tried to breath in less. Reporting from the animal market where the SARS outbreak is thought to have started, I told myself that I should be OK, since it was outdoors. But I stayed away from animals being slaughtered, didn’t touch any surfaces and took my shoes off before entering my hotel room. Note that these decisions do not mean ignoring the data and infectious disease specialists’ recommendations, as some on the right are doing as they push ahead to reopen schools, businesses, restaurants and sports events. Actually it’s kind of the opposite: Accepting risk doesn’t mean throwing caution to the wind. It means taking all precautions and deciding you can live with the very reduced risk that remains. With the coronavirus, the only way to eliminate all risk is essentially to move to a house in the countryside and live in your family bubble. And many Americans, particularly wealthy ones, have done just that. This personal response was extreme, but it felt rational to many people because our national response to the coronavirus was so scattershot, flat-footed and incompetent. But isolation is wearing thin. So as states and cities engineer sensible reopening policies, everyone is going to have to assess their risk tolerance and cautiously push their personal boundaries bit by bit. Some, of course, never got to make this decision. Risk tolerance is about duty and conscience but very often it’s also about how much you need a paycheck. Doctors, nurses and others who work in health care had no choice but to dive in. These folks did not, as so many have claimed, go into the profession “knowing the risks.” They came to work knowing that the risk of infectious diseases could be controlled with careful precautions. That’s why they felt angry and betrayed when they were asked to fight the novel coronavirus without an adequate supply of protective gear or (in some places) training about the new pathogen. And tragically, some died as a result.
