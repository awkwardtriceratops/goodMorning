There’s a lot to worry about. We’re holding an election during a pandemic. Republicans are discussing aggressive tactics aimed, some charge, at suppressing the Democratic vote. And President Trump, who has sown doubts about mail-in voting, has repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power should he lose. Democrats hope for an overwhelming “blue wave” to forestall such shenanigans. How can you help ensure this outcome? Giving money is fine, but you can also donate your energy. Volunteer. Here’s a list of some ways to help. This is, in many ways, the easiest way to participate. Once you sign up, the campaign will direct you to where it thinks it thinks you’ll be most effective, which may include battleground states. You can also specify areas you’d like to focus on. Creatives can sign up to create graphics, memes and other content. Spanish-speakers can sign up to call or text voters. And anyone can download the Vote Joe App. One of the most effective ways to increase voter turnout, experts told me repeatedly, is to ensure that your friends and family know how to vote. Once downloaded, the app finds those in your contact list who live in a battleground state, so that you can reach out to them. Poll workers are especially in demand this year because of the pandemic. The people who often staff polling sites — older, retired people — are more likely to stay home. If poll sites don’t have enough workers, they can’t open, making it harder for people to vote. Poll work is nonpartisan (and often paid). The nonprofit group Work Elections can help you find your local election office, where you can sign up. Or you can sign up through Power The Polls, which aims to recruit poll workers around the country. Alternatively, you can volunteer as a partisan poll observer. These observers are trained to spot and report problems for their respective parties. Many states allow only one per party per polling site or precinct. You can sign up through your state’s chapter of the Democratic Party or through the Biden campaign. Fair Fight, a group founded by Stacey Abrams, the former candidate for governor of Georgia, is also recruiting election observers, with a focus on battleground states. You can even protect the integrity of the vote from home by volunteering with the nonpartisan group Election Protection, which, among other endeavors, monitors and flags social media for disinformation. Those with legal experience can staff its hotline, 866-OUR-VOTE. The Last Weekends, run by Swing Left, has a site where, using your ZIP code, you can locate nearby efforts to “virtually connect with voters in key states in order to swing the Senate, beat Trump, and turn state legislatures blue.” (Indivisible, another progressive group, also allows you to find events by ZIP code.) Or you can write a letter to a voter through The Big Send, which aims to send at least 15 million letters in 2020. It’s a nice option for people who don’t feel comfortable cold-calling or texting voters. The group organizing the effort, Vote Forward, claims that letters sent to voters increased turnout in the 2017 Alabama special election for the U.S. Senate and the Ohio “OH-12” special election. You can volunteer directly for the Wisconsin Democratic Party. In 2016, Wisconsin went to President Trump by less than 1 percentage point. It’s now experiencing the worst coronavirus outbreak of all the battleground states. It’s looking for volunteers for two important activities: “vote chasing,” which involves calling would-be voters who’ve requested absentee ballots to ensure they know how to fill them out properly; and “vote curing,” which involves calling people whose ballots have been rejected for technicalities and helping them remedy the problem. Here’s the pitch from Ben Wikler, the chairman of the Democratic Party there: “The No. 1 thing that every American who wants to rescue democracy in the country can do is to sign up for phone bank shifts with the Democratic Party in Wisconsin.” You can do something similar for the Democratic Party in North Carolina, a state with a troubling history of restrictions on voting. The party there is also conducting vote-chasing calls. Again, this is not necessarily about cold-calling to persuade undecided voters, which can seem intimidating, but about ensuring votes are properly cast and counted.
