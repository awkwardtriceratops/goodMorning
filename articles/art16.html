By Eric Lipton WASHINGTON — Long before he moved into the White House, Donald J. Trump had cemented his reputation as a lover of lawsuits, turning to federal and state courts for battles big and small. Mr. Trump once even boasted, “I like beating my enemies to the ground.” Since becoming a public official, he has remained litigious. But he now has found a variety of new ways to fund his legal fights, often without having to personally cover the tab, by turning to money donated to his campaign committees. Here are some of the highlights of what could be dubbed the Trump Docket, a dizzyingly diverse collection of lawsuits and other legal actions filed by Mr. Trump or against him since he began his bid for the president. It helps explain why he and his political allies have spent nearly $60 million of donor money on legal and compliance bills since 2015, far more than any other president. Mr. Trump has been particularly aggressive since he was elected in using the legal system to try to silence or challenge his critics — a tactic he also frequently turned to during his decades as a real estate executive. This has resulted in a series of claims against one-time campaign or White House aides, such as Jessica Denson, who worked as a phone bank supervisor and Hispanic outreach coordinator during the Trump campaign in 2016. Ms. Denson alleged that she was the target of abusive treatment and sexual harassment by another campaign staff member. Mr. Trump then filed an arbitration claim asserting Ms. Denson had violated a confidential agreement she had signed. Here a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Lawrence S. Rosen, pushes a federal court judge in New York on the matter. Initially, the American Arbitration Association ruled against Ms. Denson and ordered her to pay almost $50,000 in attorneys’ fees and other costs. But the payment demand was overturned by a New York State court in February and more recently, Ms. Denson — with the help of a high-profile legal team led by David K. Bowles, a prominent New York lawyer — has taken on Mr. Trump as part of a class-action lawsuit that she hopes will nullify many of the nondisclosure agreements other campaign workers signed. Here is a complaint where Mr. Bowles and others on Ms. Denson’s legal team argue that these nondisclosure agreements are illegal.
