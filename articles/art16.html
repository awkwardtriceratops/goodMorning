It doesn’t matter that I feel like an impostor sometimes — there’s an expectation that I’ll be able to handle any cooking question. I deal with this by openly admitting when I don’t know something and then letting in-depth research guide me to a satisfying answer. (It helps that I’m usually genuinely curious to find out.) I used to frequent libraries and stand at the shoulders of cooks, furiously taking notes, then call with follow-up questions. I would often visit immigrant communities to eat the same dish at several restaurants to learn about variations. But the pandemic has changed how I can pursue answers. The flavor touchstones and other sensory cues I once scavenged for in my reporting aren’t available to me right now, because I’m not observing other cooks or tasting their food before I sit down to write. Because I can’t use firsthand experience to guide my storytelling right now, I’ve started to depend on the vibrant taste memories of others instead.
