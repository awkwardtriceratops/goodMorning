Like the river, she will have to be strong. By Sônia Guajajara Ms. Guajajara is an Indigenous activist. MARANHÃO STATE, Brazil — My daughter, Y’Wara, is 15. Last September she became a woman in the Menina Moça ceremony, which our tribe, the Guajajara, has performed for centuries. The men go into the forest to hunt up to two months before the ceremony. They bring back animals we consider sacred, like the tinamou — a quick, ground-dwelling bird whose call sounds like a whistle. And they also hunt for monkeys, wild pigs and the large rodents called pacas that will be made into a stew to serve to the elders of our community, the girls, and those closest to them the morning after the party. For at least a month, the carcasses are laid out and smoked to conserve the meat. Before the ceremony, my daughter, along with other girls from our village, each retreated into a small hut made of straw, while we tended to them. We consider water to be sacred. The mother of the river protects the waters, takes illness from us and purifies us. And so on the final day, they emerged from the hut wearing all white. As we sang and danced, they walked to the river to bathe, and the date was set for the celebration in September 2019. Over three days, our relatives made their way to our village. We spent the day before the festival singing, dancing and preparing the food that would be served the morning after. During the day the girls were painted with genipap and decorated with feathers and dressed for the festivities. Y’Wara wore a yellow headdress, a symbol of beauty and power. Before the sun set, the singers began to sing and invited the girls to join the party. The girls dressed in long red skirts and colorful headdresses made from the feathers of local birds like macaws or parrots. Each one danced with a male singer who held her by the arm. Their songs rang throughout the forest — they called out to the animals, birds and trees, asking that the girls be imbued with wisdom and protection. At night the girls retired to eat and rest before the final ceremony at dawn. This time they emerged with white feather headdresses. Their mothers and grandmothers also wore feathers in their hair and on their faces, imitating birds. We danced again until the morning, when the festivities ended and we began to serve the meal. The girls eat the tinamou meat, so that they can be sharp, move quickly and soar.
