This summer, his focus changed and so did the kind of attention he got. By Alex Marshall LONDON — Taco Hemingway is a household name in Poland. One of the country’s biggest rappers, he has songs that get millions of views, and before the coronavirus hit, he filled arenas with bouncing fans, extravagant light displays dancing around him onstage. But last Friday, his demeanor was a far cry from the bravado typical of a hugely successful rapper. Sitting outside a cheap cafe in West London, Hemingway, whose real name is Filip Szczesniak, seemed nervous and avoided eye contact. “I’ve always been an extremely anxious person,” he said, by way of explanation. He rarely posts on social media or gives interviews, afraid his every word will be dissected by the Polish media and fans. This is his first for a printed newspaper or magazine since 2015, and his first in English. He only agreed to it, he said, because his parents “wouldn’t forgive me if I said no” to The New York Times. There were other reasons for Szczesniak’s anxiety to be flaring up. Over the summer, he released a track, “Polskie Tango” (“Polish Tango”), which many saw as a direct criticism of Poland’s right-wing government and the culture of fear it’s often seen to have created in the country through its attacks on gay and women’s rights. “Our national colors are just like Santa Claus,” he rapped in the chorus, referring to the country’s red and white flag, “which makes sense since I stopped believing in Poland a long time ago.” He soon found himself under attack on social media and becoming a target for conservative journalists, he said. “I got myself tangled up in politics,” Szczesniak added. “That was just not pleasant.” This interview was only likely to reignite that and cause him to be labeled “anti-Polish and a tattletale,” he added. He didn’t sound like he was looking forward to it. He also knew just how tense feelings are in Poland at the moment. The day before the interview, a court ruling had severely restricted abortion rights in the country and people were already on the streets protesting. When asked about this, Szczesniak got visibly upset. “It’s awful,” he said. “It’s another step in the wrong direction for Poland.” “I don’t think it’s unpatriotic to raise concerns,” he said, later. “It’s patriotic to point out all the wrongdoings of the ruling party, and to hope for a better future. It’s actually unpatriotic to just accept everything and take a beating.” It took Szczesniak, 30, a long time to get tangled up in politics. He started rapping at age 17, recording some songs in his mom’s basement in English. No one listened to them, he said, with a laugh. For the next eight years, he rapped in his spare time, while taking an anthropology degree and working as a copywriter. In 2015, he started gaining recognition in Poland after the release of an album in Polish called “Warsaw Triangle,” about three lovers unhappily chasing each other around the Polish capital. It became a sleeper hit, and soon Szczesniak was releasing an album every summer, happily jumping between styles from trap to dance beats to dreamy Drake-like numbers. But recently, Szczesniak said, he started feeling stuck in a rut. “I was either making albums about partying, or I was making them about how fed up I was with partying and wanted my old life back,” he said. “I thought, ‘I probably should switch it up.’” In January, he decided, for the first time, “to write an album that’s about Poland,” he said. The decision was partly because of Poland’s worsening political and social situation, he said. The country has for years been in the grip of a culture war, with liberals on one side and the governing populist Law and Justice Party, and its conservative supporters, on the other. “Polish Tango,” Szczesniak’s first single from that album, made his new musical direction clear. Its impact came partly from timing, he said: It was released two days before Poland’s presidential election in July. The song does not actually mention the Law and Justice party but its video had a clear reference. At the end eight stars appeared, an internet meme meant to be a censored version of a sexual expletive and then the governing party’s initials.
