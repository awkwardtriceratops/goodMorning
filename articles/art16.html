Within hours, the kind of unrest sparked in other cities by fatal confrontations between African-Americans and law enforcement began bubbling up in Lafayette. The tension might have escalated into something larger. But two major storms were churning in the Gulf of Mexico and appeared to be intensifying, with Lafayette in their projected path, and the protests were brought to a near halt. Still, the killing on Aug. 21 tapped into a sense of fury, fueled by longstanding racial divides and disparities, that had been simmering in the city. Recently, city officials tried to close several community centers that serve mostly Black neighborhoods, a debate that played out amid a pandemic that has been especially punishing to the African-American community. In many ways, the troubles facing Lafayette, in the heart of Louisiana’s oil patch, reflect the stresses that have afflicted America this year. Over the last several months, the city’s 126,000 residents have negotiated an exhausting catalog of hardships — a coronavirus that has infected thousands, a hobbled economy, protests over police violence and systemic racism and, over the past week, a brutal hurricane season. “We’re hurting right now,” said Diane Touchet, who lives near the Shell convenience store where the authorities said Mr. Pellerin, 31, was shot at least 10 times. She was referring not only to the pandemic, but to the broader turbulence.
