Some Key Voters Actually Like Them<br></h1><p id="artcont">Some of the working-class voters Biden must appeal to are sometimes enthralled by President Trump’s transgressions. By Stephanie Muravchik and Jon A. Shields Ms. Muravchik and Mr. Shields are the authors of the forthcoming “Trump’s Democrats.” If Joe Biden is going to rebuild the Democrats’ “blue wall” and win states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, and claim the White House, he will need to appeal to the working-class Democratic communities that put Donald Trump over the top in 2016. They include more than 200 counties that supported Barack Obama twice before voting for Mr. Trump. Many of these places had long records of unbroken support for Democratic presidential candidates, some even stretching back to before the New Deal. Mr. Biden needs to tune in to their cultural sensibilities if he’s going to bring at least some of these pivotal blue strongholds back into the Democratic fold. He is one of the few Democrats, as a child of working-class Scranton, Pa., capable of doing so. We spent the past few years hanging out in bars, churches and town council meetings with these voters — whom we call “Trump’s Democrats.” We interviewed nearly 100 people in three formerly blue strongholds that voted for Mr. Trump: Johnston, R.I., a suburb of Providence; Ottumwa, Iowa, a small industrial city and an inspiration for the setting of the Roseanne Barr show; and Elliott County, a tiny Appalachian community in northeastern Kentucky. Despite their geographic diversity, these places have much in common with one another and with the many Democratic communities that swung for Mr. Trump in critical Midwest battleground states. They are overwhelmingly white and working class. They care about patriotism and serving their country and are especially attached to the places they live, with strong, place-based loyalties. Their honor culture is common throughout the world and in many American communities that are not dominated by the professional managerial class.
