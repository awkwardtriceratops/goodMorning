By Lee Epstein and Eric Posner Ms. Epstein is a political scientist and law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. Mr. Posner is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. The religious right has made no secret of its expectation that President Trump will choose a socially conservative successor to the seat held by Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And the president will likely deliver, further confirming the power of the religious right. The conservative legal movement, which at one time was libertarian in spirit, has been hijacked by the religious right. This religious version has left a deep mark on the Supreme Court under the leadership of Chief Justice John Roberts. Mr. Trump’s recent 2020 edition of potential Supreme Court nominees included many lawyers and politicians known for their religious commitments and affiliations. One is Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who complained last spring that religious conservatives had not actually played an adequate role in Mr. Trump’s selection process. He was incensed that Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote an opinion, in the Bostock v. Clayton County case, protecting gay and transgender employees from workplace discrimination. And yet if Bostock was a defeat for religious conservatives, it was an unusual one — at least nowadays. The numbers leave no doubt. Over the past several decades, the Supreme Court has decided dozens of cases involving the rights of religious individuals and organizations. We analyzed a large subset of those cases in which religious rights under the First Amendment were the primary issue being litigated. (Bostock, which involved the federal civil rights law, was not such a case.) From 1953 (the start of the Earl Warren court) to 2005 (the end of the William Rehnquist court), the Supreme Court ruled in favor of religious parties roughly 50 percent of the time. Under Chief Justice Roberts, that figure has soared — to almost 90 percent. What accounts for this change? The current Republican-appointed justices, plus Antonin Scalia, whom Justice Gorsuch replaced. Before the Roberts court, justices appointed by Republican presidents voted in favor of litigants making religious claims 56 percent of the time; justices appointed by Democratic presidents voted in their favor 47 percent of the time. There was partisan disagreement, but at a moderate level. By contrast, in the Roberts court, the voting patterns of Democratic-appointed justices as a group have not changed (still at 47 percent in favor of the religious party), but Republican justices have voted for religious parties 90 percent of the time. Even more remarkable, of all the justices who have sat on cases since 1953, those who voted most often for the religious side belonged to the current conservative bloc on the court: Brett Kavanaugh (100 percent), Neil Gorsuch (100 percent), Clarence Thomas (94 percent), John Roberts (93 percent) and Samuel Alito (93 percent).
