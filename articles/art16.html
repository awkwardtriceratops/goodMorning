By Neil Vigdor and Azi Paybarah Los Angeles sheriff’s deputies fatally shot a Black man who they said had a handgun on Monday afternoon after a stop turned into a violent altercation, the authorities said. The Los Angeles County deputies handcuffed the man after firing at him several times in Westmont, a South Los Angeles neighborhood. The aftermath of the shooting was recorded by bystanders, who protested the authorities’ deadly use of force. As the day turned to evening, a crowd of protesters gathered at the site of the shooting. According to the Sheriff’s Department, the man, who was not immediately identified, had been riding a bicycle when deputies tried to stop him. The reason for the stop was a code violation related to bicycle riding, according to the department, which did not elaborate on the nature of the violation. The man fled, and deputies chased him, the department said. When they caught up with the man near West 109th Place and Budlong Avenue around 3:30 p.m., a fight began. The New York Times At a news conference, Lt. Brandon Dean of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said the man had “punched one of the officers in the face” and dropped some items he had been holding. “The deputies noticed that inside the clothing items that he dropped was a black semiautomatic handgun, at which time” a deputy opened fire, he said. The Sheriff’s Department said the shooting was under investigation by multiple entities, including the district attorney’s office and the Internal Affairs Bureau, which is standard practice when a civilian is killed by an officer. The shooting took place about four miles north of where Los Angeles sheriff’s deputies fatally shot an 18-year-old Latino man five times in the back in June in Gardena, use of force that the man’s family contends had been unjustified. Hours after the shooting on Monday, more than 100 people congregated at the scene. Protesters standing behind yellow tape held up raised fists and signs like “Black Lives Matter,” “Defund the Police” and “Resign All L.A.S.D.” During chants by the demonstrators, sheriff’s deputies stared silently  at the protesters while the lights of two police vehicles shined at the crowd. One demonstrator, Taegen Meyer, said she had turned out to protest to “stand with community, stand with families and show our dedication to justice.” A group of people who had been protesting for three months coordinated on the encrypted messaging app Signal, she said, declaring it an emergency action. There was one arrest for unlawful assembly, Deputy Tracy Koerner, a spokesman for the department, said on Tuesday morning.
