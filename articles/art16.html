By Kenneth Chang When NASA’s OSIRIS-REX spacecraft touched the surface of an asteroid on Tuesday to gather a sample of rocks and dirt, the operation proceeded smoothly, to the glee of the mission’s operators 200 million miles away on Earth. But the biggest question remained unanswered: How much of the asteroid did OSIRIS-REX pick up? Did it manage to gather any samples at all? On Wednesday, the mission managers released a video of the sampling mechanism hitting the surface of the asteroid, within three feet or so of where the spacecraft had been aimed. “I must have watched about a hundred times last night,” Dante Lauretta, the principal investigator of the mission, said during a news conference on Wednesday. The sampling mechanism set down partly on a rock about 8 inches wide. That could have caused a problem if it had prevented the mechanism from pressing up against the surface. “But literally, we crushed it,” Dr. Lauretta said. “When the spacecraft made contact, that rock appears to fragment and shatter, which is great news.” A burst of nitrogen gas kicked up a cloud of rocks and dirt, as hoped. “You can see that particles are flying all over the place,” Dr. Lauretta said. “We really did kind of make a mess on the surface of this asteroid, but it’s a good mess.” The chances that spacecraft captured a sizable sample “have gone way, way up,” he said.
