What will the new administration do about it? By Jess Kelly Ms. Kelly is a filmmaker whose husband, a human rights activist, has been arrested by the Egyptian government. LONDON — I missed the first call from Karim. I was watching TV, and my phone was on silent. The previous day, one of my husband’s colleagues from the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights — one of the last remaining human rights organizations in Egypt — had been arrested. But Karim reassured me: He was taking a few days’ break on the beach; he said there was no need to worry. He always tells me that. Two months ago, Karim Ennarah and I were married in a short ceremony at Cairo’s Ministry of Justice. Whenever Karim enters government property, he gets nervous — which is understandable. He is a human rights defender in a country where some 60,000 people have been arrested as political prisoners. The wedding had taken months to arrange, and this was the final bureaucratic hurdle. Just as we were about to sign the marriage contract, the I.T. system went down and a Justice Ministry official warned us that it could take hours or days to get it running again. My Egyptian visa was going to expire the next day; a long delay would have sent us back to square one. When the computers rumbled back on a few minutes later, it felt like a sign. We walked out of the building as husband and wife, ready to start a new life.
