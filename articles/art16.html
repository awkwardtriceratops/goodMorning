Kirby has listened to a determined refrain from fellow Kenosha residents who have endured the tumult of the past two weeks. We need to rebuild our burned businesses, they tell him. We need to get back to normal. That’s where he interjects. “Let’s not get back to anything,” he said. Kenosha erupted in outrage and division over days of tragedy, violence and destruction. Since August 23, the city has been the scene of a police shooting that left a man paralyzed, the killing of two protesters in the street, emotional demonstrations and several nights of looting and fires.Last week, it became a hotly contested presidential battleground, as President Trump visited, followed by Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic candidate. As a nightly curfew in Kenosha has been lifted and protests have quieted, the question of what comes next for this city has revealed an even wider chasm between residents. Should it follow the leads of Ferguson, Mo., and Minneapolis after their own periods of unrest, as some in Kenosha have argued, and consider diversifying its slate of mostly white elected officials, re-examine longstanding policies and pass measures aimed at reforming policing? Or should residents view the last two weeks as an awful aberration, events that some residents described as rioting largely by outside agitators? “We haven’t had a huge event like this, something where we’ve really had to have a conversation about race,” said Tim Thompkins, a former affirmative action officer for the city of Kenosha. “That’s why we’re going to have such difficulty.” The death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May sparked a handful of protests in downtown Kenosha by Black Lives Matter activists throughout the summer. But the city itself has not faced a real racial reckoning until now. That may be in part because it is a small, mostly white community. Of its 100,000 residents, 11 percent are Black, a proportion that has increased only slightly in the past 30 years. Kenosha’s struggles for the last generation have been focused on rebuilding a faltering economy after car manufacturing mostly disappeared in the late 1980s, erasing 10 percent of the city’s work force.
