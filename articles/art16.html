Unlike other advanced democracies, we have punted critical decisions to the courts, making every Supreme Court nomination an existential political crisis. Congress should invoke its Article III powers to remove important legislation from judicial review and correct terrible court mistakes on issues like gun control, money in politics, voting rights and abortion. The second problem is how we select justices. The court composition should not be a random walk decided by the actuarial tables. The best solution is to limit terms to 18 years and stagger them so that two vacancies come up in each presidential term. Alternatively, terms could be limited with justices chosen by lot from members of the 13 circuit courts. And how about more diversity, meaning a moratorium on any more justices from Harvard and Yale Law Schools! Adam Wasserman
Santa Fe, N.M. To the Editor: Because the Supreme Court is literally the court of last resort, and since the opinions of the court often have the effect of amending the Constitution, and since the justices are not elected by the people and have lifetime tenure, I believe that its rulings should require a supermajority of the members. It takes three-quarters of the states to ratify an amendment to the Constitution. So, all things considered, I suggest that decisions of the court should be agreed to by at least three-quarters of the justices — which in the case of a nine-member court would mean seven justices. This helps assure that the controversy at hand has been closely vetted and should minimize its political bias. Herb Van Fleet
Tulsa, Okla. To the Editor: Politics has overwhelmed the one institution in America that should be deeply rooted in nonpartisanship. Therefore, I would: 1) Create a select panel of legal scholars to develop a list of nine candidates and require the president to nominate from that list. 2) Institute 15-year term limits. 3) Require the House to ratify a Senate confirmation with a simple majority before seating a judge. 4) Institute a mandatory 90-day process to ensure that appointments are not made close to an election — but also require that the process must begin within 30 days of a vacancy. In sum, create rules that prevent corruption of this sacred body by politics. Rosemary Kuropat
Wainscott, N.Y. To the Editor: Here is my suggestion for dealing with the hijacking of the Supreme Court: Congress can create new specialized courts and vest them with exclusive jurisdiction over voting rights and health care rights (including abortion) — and not permit appeals from these courts to the Supreme Court. We already have specialized courts whose jurisdiction depends on the subject matter of the claims rather than on the geographic location of the litigants, such as the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. For instance, Congress could enact a new John Lewis Voting Rights Act that vests in a new Court of Voting Rights exclusive jurisdiction to interpret and enforce voting rights — with no appellate jurisdiction in the Supreme Court. Similarly, Congress could amend the Affordable Care Act to vest exclusive jurisdiction over federal health care matters. Then, Congress should aggressively legislate federal policy in these areas.

The writer is a lawyer. To the Editor: There are many simple reforms that could improve the Supreme Court — adding term and age limits, expanding its size, or merging the circuit courts with it and using judicial panels to hear final appeals. But the real problem is the excessive power of the courts to shape national policy through judicial review. This arises not because the court seeks expanded power, but because the badly written U.S. Constitution leaves too many ambiguities about the fundamental rights of the people, the extent of federal and state power, and the rights and powers of the different branches of government. The court has been forced into the role of resolving those ambiguities, which creates absurdities such as the court deciding which health care plans the federal government can offer. To truly fix the court, we need to fix the Constitution and make our entire governmental system more democratic and more effective. Rob Lewis

The writer is a dual American-Canadian citizen. To the Editor: Our system of checks and balances is supposed to be designed so that no one branch of the state can take precedence over the other. The executive can veto the legislature, but the legislature can override the veto. This is understood. So why is there no such counterpoint with regard to the Supreme Court? Part of the answer rests in the fact that the role of the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of constitutionality is traditional, not legal. The court made it up 200 years ago and, for the most part, we all go along with it. We should create a check against the Supreme Court. This should be in the form of a legislative veto, or more optimally a democratic referendum. Perhaps the court should be subject to periodic votes of confidence by which the citizens can disband the existing court if it rules contrary to the desires of the American people. As it stands, there is no check against a Supreme Court decision, and that fact is an unfortunate holy grail for political cynics like Mitch McConnell. Michael Andoscia
Cape Coral, Fla. To the Editor: The primary way to “fix” the Supreme Court is to fix our legislative process, so that major decisions don’t continue to be pushed up to the courts to solve. For too long, elected officials have failed to wrestle to the ground the thorniest issues facing the country — immigration, gun control, voting rights, policing — because they either are beholden to interest groups or fear short-term repercussions that affect their re-election.

Grapevine, Texas To the Editor: We need to take politics out of nominations. Gone are the days when nominees got votes across the aisle. I liked Pete Buttigieg’s idea of 15 justices: five appointed by Republicans, five by Democrats and five by the justices themselves. Andrea Woodner
New York To the Editor: The present system allows a president who inherits the opportunity to fill two or more vacancies on the Supreme Court to consolidate the direction of the country into the unforeseeable future, regardless of changing conditions and mores. Two solutions present themselves: Justices should be limited to one 12-year term, and they should be elected in a national election rather than chosen by the president. This would presumably prevent either political party from having a solid majority on the court far into the future whether or not the presidency changed hands. Lois Taylor
Old Greenwich, Conn. To the Editor: It’s good to have three independent branches of government so that they can act as checks on one another. So the objective should be to make the Supreme Court more independent of politics. Limit the justices to nine-year terms, so that one justice is replaced each year. But just rotate them with federal appeals court judges. And select the appeals court judge to be elevated randomly from those who have been on the bench at least five years. This would push most of the politics out of the process. Brent Meeker
Camarillo, Calif. To the Editor: I have a simple fix. Both the Senate majority leader and the Senate minority leader have to agree on a nomination for it to go forward. John Ranta
