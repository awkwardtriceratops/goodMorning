China sent two anti-submarine aircraft toward the island in response. By Amy Qin TAIPEI, Taiwan — A senior U.S. envoy arrived in Taiwan on Thursday to attend a memorial service for former President Lee Teng-hui, in the Trump administration’s latest move to bolster its support of the island in defiance of threats from Beijing. The Taiwanese foreign ministry said that the envoy, Keith Krach, under secretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, was the highest-level official from the State Department to visit the island in decades. China, which claims self-governed Taiwan as its territory and opposes formal exchanges of any kind, responded to the news of Mr. Krach’s visit on Wednesday by sending two anti-submarine aircraft into the island’s air defense identification zone, according to the Taiwanese defense ministry. The planes were warned off by the Taiwanese air force, the ministry said. Mr. Krach’s visit reflects a growing effort by the Trump administration to counter China’s attempts in recent years to isolate Taiwan on the global stage. The trip, which began on Thursday and ends on Saturday, comes just one month after Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, became the highest-level U.S. cabinet member to visit Taiwan since 1979. The State Department said that the focus of Mr. Krach’s visit was the memorial service for Mr. Lee, who led Taiwan from dictatorship to democracy, though the Taiwanese government said that the American envoy would also discuss economic issues. Mr. Krach will meet with President Tsai Ing-wen on Friday. For Taiwan, the trip is an opportunity to demonstrate stronger ties with Washington as relations with Beijing become increasingly tense. China has recently stepped up military activities in the narrow strait that separates the mainland from the island and has also become more bellicose in its rhetoric. Tsai Shih-ying, a legislator from the governing Democratic Progressive Party of Taiwan who is on the foreign affairs and national defense committee, said, “Right now, the focus is to let China know that Taiwan will not bow to the threat of force.” “The second priority is to let China know that not only will Taiwan not bow, it has many powerful allies that will not let China just act blindly without thinking,” he added. Last month, the United States announced that it was establishing a new economic dialogue with Taiwan focused on technology, health care, energy and other sectors. Taiwan hopes talks will result in a free-trade agreement with the United States. The Trump administration has also stepped up military support for Taiwan in recent years through increased arms sales. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that the U.S. government planned to sell as many as seven major weapon systems, including mines, cruise missiles and drones, to Taiwan. The island’s defense ministry called the report a “media assumption.” China has reacted angrily. On Thursday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official in Beijing said that Mr. Krach’s visit undermined relations between Beijing and Washington and warned that China would respond “as necessary.” In an editorial about the report of the new arms sale, Global Times, a nationalist tabloid owned by the Chinese Communist Party, said, “Once the People’s Liberation Army dispatches troops to reunify the island of Taiwan, the military equipment from the U.S. will be nothing but decorations.”
