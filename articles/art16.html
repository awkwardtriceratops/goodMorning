By Adam Liptak WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday refused for now to reinstate a federal requirement that women seeking to end their pregnancies using medications pick up a pill in person from a hospital or medical office. A judge had blocked the requirement in light of the coronavirus pandemic, saying that a needless trip to a medical facility during a health crisis very likely imposed an undue burden on the constitutional right to abortion. The Supreme Court’s brief, unsigned order said that “a more comprehensive record would aid this court’s review.” The justices instructed the trial judge to take a fresh look at the case and to rule within 40 days. In the meantime the disputed requirement will remain suspended. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, issued a dissent accusing the majority of inconsistency in its rulings on cases arising from the pandemic and of effectively deciding the case by failing to act. Justice Alito wrote that the court had restricted religious liberty by refusing to exempt churches from state shutdown orders but had expanded abortion rights in the face of a government safety regulation. “In response to the pandemic, state and local officials have imposed unprecedented restrictions on personal liberty, including severe limitations on First Amendment rights,” he wrote. “Officials have drastically limited speech, banning or restricting public speeches, lectures, meetings and rallies. The free exercise of religion also has suffered previously unimaginable restraints, and this court has stood by while that has occurred.” “In the present case, however,” Justice Alito wrote, “the district court took a strikingly different approach. While Covid-19 has provided the ground for restrictions on First Amendment rights, the district court saw the pandemic as a ground for expanding the abortion right recognized in Roe v. Wade.” He added that six weeks had passed since the Trump administration had asked the Supreme Court to intercede. “For all practical purposes, there is little difference between what the court has done and an express denial of the government’s application,” Justice Alito wrote. The case concerned a restriction imposed by the Food and Drug Administration on medication abortions, which are permitted in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. About 60 percent of abortions performed in those weeks use two drugs rather than surgery. The first drug, mifepristone, blocks the effects of progesterone, a hormone without which the lining of the uterus begins to break down. A second drug, misoprostol, taken 24 to 48 hours later, induces contractions of the uterus that expel its contents. The contested measure requires women to appear in person to pick up the mifepristone and to sign a form, even when they had already consulted with their doctors remotely. The women can then take the drug when and where they choose. There is no requirement that women pick up misoprostol in person, and it is available at retail and mail-order pharmacies.
