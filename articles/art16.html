For two years, he had been studying the impact of the changing climate on global migration around the world. Suddenly, with fires raging so close to home, he had to ask himself the question he had been asking other people: Was it time to move? This week on The Sunday Read, Abrahm explores a nation on the cusp of transformation. This story was written by Abrahm Lustgarten and recorded by Audm.
