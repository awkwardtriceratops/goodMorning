By James Wagner SAN DIEGO — After a tight postseason struggle against a division rival, the Yankees ended another promising season well short of their World Series goal. The Yankees, considered a title contender before the season, fell, 2-1, to the Tampa Bay Rays in a tense do-or-die Game 5 in an American League division series on Friday. Mike Brosseau, who entered the game in the seventh inning, delivered a late, crushing blow against the Yankees and earned some revenge against reliever Aroldis Chapman in the process. It was a month ago that Chapman threw a 101-mile-per-hour pitch near Brosseau’s head during another flare-up in the ongoing rivalry between the two teams, earning a three-game suspension. In the eighth inning on Friday, Chapman fired a 100-miles-per-hour pitch over the plate, and Brosseau smashed it over the left-field wall to give the Rays the winning run and send them to the next round. The home run capped a taut contest in which both teams’ pitching staffs gave little ground. Gerrit Cole, the ace of the Yankees’ starting rotation, tossed five and one-third strong innings, while the Rays suffocated the Yankees’ potent offense with strong pitching and defense. The Rays will now face the reviled Houston Astros, who carried out a sign-stealing scheme during their championship-winning season in 2017. While the Astros are making their fourth straight appearance in the A.L. Championship Series, the Rays last reached this round in 2008. And the Yankees will return home to face another long winter. In their last off-season, they committed a record $324 million to Cole, the type of elite starting pitcher they had lacked in past postseasons. But instead of reaching their first World Series since 2009, the Yankees fell short again.
