Now the police are appealing to the public for information. By Bryan Pietsch What the burglars lacked in panache, they made up for in their ability to stymie the London police after stealing a valuable collection of handguns brandished by James Bond himself in three movies. On Monday, the Metropolitan Police appealed to the public for help in finding the thieves, six months after the burglary. They released security camera footage of a decidedly un-Bondlike vehicle — a stubby four-door Vauxhall hatchback — that they believe the burglars were using to case the home of the collector they robbed on March 23. Three thieves broke into the home in Enfield, north London, escaped through a window and fled in the getaway car, the police said, making off with five guns that had been used in various “James Bond” films. The police are still searching for four of the weapons. One, a .22-caliber Llama pistol with a yellow handle that was featured in “Die Another Day (2002), was found “severely rusted” in a field about 10 miles north of the home by a passer-by. Two other stolen weapons — a Beretta Cheetah pistol and a Beretta Tomcat pistol — were also used in “Die Another Day.” Another of the firearms, all of which had been “deactivated,” a Smith & Weston .44 Magnum, was featured in “Live and Let Die” (1973).
