In 1867, three Irishmen, members of the Fenian Brotherhood, an organization that sought to end British rule, were publicly executed following the murder of a policeman. The three became known as the Manchester Martyrs, and their story kickstarts McGuire’s third novel, which “swerves from comedy to the darker stuff with ease and elegance,” our reviewer Roddy Doyle writes. “It is far from a funny book, but Dickens is there in the language, the coincidences, the unrolling of the story.”
