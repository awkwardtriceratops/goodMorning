Jaime Harrison Chases a Democratic Dream<br></h1><p id="artcont">South Carolina’s Senate race is a national obsession. By Frank Bruni Opinion Columnist It was a bit of news that came and went quickly amid the fury of political developments these days, but last weekend Jaime Harrison, the South Carolina Democrat who is fighting to unseat Lindsey Graham, announced that he had not merely broken the record for fund-raising for a Senate candidate in a single quarter. He had shattered it. From July through September, Harrison took in about $57 million. That was nearly $20 million more than Beto O’Rourke, the previous record-holder, collected during the same span two years ago, when he waged his ultimately unsuccessful battle against Ted Cruz in Texas. “I pinch myself,” Harrison said when I spoke with him on Tuesday night. “Good Lord.” He’s the recipient of so much money because he’s the vessel of so much hope. While he may not have the nationwide celebrity that O’Rourke attained in 2018 and South Carolina is much smaller than Texas, the themes in Harrison’s challenge of Graham are as big as can be.
