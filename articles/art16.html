Her students included Deborah Voigt and Nadine Sierra. By Anthony Tommasini Ruth Falcon, a soprano who sang leading roles at major international opera houses and went on to become a sought-after voice teacher, mentoring prominent artists including Deborah Voigt, Sondra Radvanovsky and Danielle de Niese, died on Oct. 9 in Manhattan. She was 77. The cause was complications of heart disease, her husband, Douglas W. Meyer, said. At her death Ms. Falcon was still working remotely with students around the world, including from the Mannes School of Music, where she taught for nearly 30 years. Following an auspicious 1974 debut with the New York City Opera as Micaela in Bizet’s “Carmen,” Ms. Falcon moved quickly in her career. In 1976 she became a member of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, where her roles included Donna Anna in “Don Giovanni,” Countess Almaviva in “Le Nozze di Figaro” and Leonora in “Il Trovatore.” She appeared in the major houses of Berlin, Paris, Monte Carlo, Prague and Vienna. Her rich, sizable voice proved well suited to roles requiring more vocal weight and carrying power, like the Empress in Richard Strauss’s “Die Frau Ohne Schatten,” the role of her 1989 debut at the Metropolitan Opera. Her Met debut was a high-pressured event: She substituted for a soprano who had taken ill. In his New York Times review, the critic Donal Henahan wrote that Ms. Falcon was a “soprano to reckon with” whose “robust and glistening voice easily pierced the lushest orchestration.” Ms. Falcon sang just 10 more performances with the Met over eight years, in roles including Chrysothemis in Strauss’s “Elektra” and the daunting title role of Puccini’s “Turandot.” During this period she was drawn into teaching, maintaining a private studio and, in 1991, accepting the position at Mannes, which is part of the New School. She had initially resisted teaching, worried that the work would impede her own career. But the splendid success of an early student, Ms. Voigt, who became a leading dramatic soprano, soon brought other aspirants to her studio. Ms. Voigt’s career was well underway when she approached Ms. Falcon — who sang similar roles — for coaching during the run-up to her Met debut in 1991 as Amelia in Verdi’s “Un Ballo in Maschera.” She continued to work with Ms. Falcon regularly for some 17 years, Ms. Voigt said in a phone interview. Ms. Voigt called Ms. Falcon an astute coach and trustworthy mentor.
