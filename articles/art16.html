He Rode It to the Nomination.<br></h1><p id="artcont">POLITICAL MEMO Joseph R. Biden Jr. never wavered from his central message: that President Trump was a danger to American democracy, while he was a stable, experienced leader. Now it will be tested in a fierce battle with the president. By Jonathan Martin Staring into the camera, Joseph R. Biden Jr. recalled the white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, Va., declared that the soul of the nation was at stake in this election and, invoking America’s founding creed, claimed history’s call by vowing to defeat a president who he said threatens democracy itself. That’s how Mr. Biden accepted his party’s nomination at the conclusion of the Democratic convention Thursday night. But it’s also how he announced his candidacy, in a three-and-half minute video in April of last year. In the intervening months, Mr. Biden was occasionally thrown off balance — by attacks on his son Hunter’s work in Ukraine; questions about his antiquated cultural references and gaffe-prone speaking style; and laments that his politics were as dated as some of his favorite sayings. But he never wavered from his central message: that President Trump was a danger to American values, while he was a stable, experienced leader who represented his party’s strongest option for the general election. Nor did he succumb to the purity tests on policy that coursed through the Democratic field during the 2020 primary season. “A lot of smart Democratic strategists overcomplicated things,” said Elisabeth Smith, who was a top aide to Pete Buttigieg’s campaign, noting that most anti-Trump voters are animated chiefly by the burning desire to defeat him. Referring to Mr. Biden, she said, “Because of the way he conducted himself in primary, not kowtowing to every demand from the left, he never had to pivot from a primary to a general election message.” On Friday, Democrats were celebrating a mostly glitch-free convention, happy with Mr. Biden’s performance, many convinced of his theory of the case. As he enters the fall, his relative consistency — the through line from announcement video to acceptance speech — illustrates why he captured his party’s nomination after initial stumbles, and why he has maintained a steady lead in the polls over Mr. Trump. Whether that’s sufficient for victory in November will now be tested by the president and his allies, who will take center stage next week at a convention that will be conducted in part from the White House. Mr. Trump has relentlessly attacked Mr. Biden and Democrats in recent months, and he continued the assault on Friday, calling the Democratic convention the “darkest and angriest and gloomiest” in the country’s history.
