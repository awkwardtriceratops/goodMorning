By Kate Taylor By Hollywood standards, the downfall had already been steep. After being implicated in the nation’s largest college admissions prosecution, Lori Loughlin resigned from her exclusive country club, downsized from her expansive Bel Air estate, and saw her acting career crater. Then, on Friday, Ms. Loughlin was sentenced to prison. As a federal judge ordered Ms. Loughlin to serve two months behind bars for her role in the admissions scandal, he expressed astonishment that someone who had what he called “a fairy-tale life” would corrupt the college admissions system out of a desire for even more status and prestige. Ms. Loughlin, who has acknowledged conspiring to pass her daughters off as rowers so they would be admitted to the University of Southern California, tearfully apologized. She said she had believed that she was acting out of love for her children but that she now realized she had only undermined them, as well as contributed to inequities in society. “That realization weighs heavily on me,” Ms. Loughlin said, “and while I wish I could go back and do things differently, I can only take responsibility and move forward.” Ms. Loughlin and her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, had both pleaded guilty to fraud. Prosecutors have said that they paid $500,000 as part of the scheme, although on Friday one of the couple’s lawyers suggested that the money was Mr. Giannulli’s alone. Prosecutors said Mr. Giannulli took a more active role in the fraud than Ms. Loughlin did, and the judge sentenced Mr. Giannulli on Friday to five months in prison. Ms. Loughlin and Mr. Giannulli had fought the charges for more than a year. And at times, the focus on the boldfaced names involved in the case — which also included the actress Felicity Huffman and Douglas Hodge, the former chief executive of Pimco — eclipsed larger questions about inequities in the admissions process. In response to the scandal, which began unfolding more than a year ago, some colleges and universities have drawn new lines between fund-raising and admissions or athletic recruitment. Others put in place safeguards to ensure that students admitted as athletes are, in fact, athletes. The case also stirred conversations around the many advantages wealthy students enjoy in admission to selective schools, including help from high-priced tutors and coaches, opportunities to excel in sports that provide a leg up in admissions, preference given to legacy applicants, and even the option of large donations that can buy access. For all of the changes, however, the nation’s largest college admissions prosecution, which federal law enforcement authorities called Operation Varsity Blues, did not spur as sweeping an overhaul to the admissions system at elite schools as some had expected. “In some ways, the bad news about the Varsity Blues scandal was that it was so extreme, it enabled people to think it was ‘them’ — and not us,” said Richard Weissbourd, a senior lecturer on education at Harvard who leads a national effort to reform college admissions as part of the Making Caring Common Project. Mr. Weissbourd said he had hoped the case would prompt a deeper self-examination by schools, in which “it would all be on the table — athletes, donors, legacy, the whole thing.” More than 50 people were charged in the case, which involved cheating on admissions tests and bribes to college coaches to falsely designate students as athletic recruits. More than 40 people have pleaded guilty or agreed to plead guilty, including William Singer, the college admissions consultant who worked with almost all of the families in the case. No school was more deeply embroiled in the scandal than U.S.C. This week, the school acknowledged for the first time that the athletic department had passed off wealthy or connected applicants as recruits even more frequently than the college admissions case had revealed. In a statement issued on Thursday, the university said it had discovered that, dating back to 2012, roughly a dozen students a year had been admitted as recruited athletes but ultimately did not compete. That included students who were not tied to Mr. Singer, but who were falsely presented as athletes because of “the past giving and/or potential future generosity of their families, or personal connections with employees in our athletics department,” the university said. The university said the admissions department had been unaware of the fraud, which was perpetrated by “a small number of athletics department employees,” all of whom “have been disciplined and/or are no longer employed by the university.” Since the case was announced in March 2019, U.S.C. has made changes to its admissions process for athletes, including requiring each head coach to certify in writing that a student is being recruited for athletic ability, and mandating that an Office of Athletic Compliance confirm that each admitted student ultimately joins a team. Other schools, including Harvard, have put in place new, or newly official, policies around fund-raising. Harvard was not involved in the admissions case but has come under scrutiny for other issues involving donations. This year the university codified its policies on gifts; under the new rules, it will not solicit gifts from any donor known to have a family member applying for admission.
