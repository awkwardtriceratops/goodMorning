By Nathaniel Persily and Charles Stewart III Mr. Persily, a law professor at Stanford, and Mr. Stewart, a political science professor at M.I.T, run the Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project. The 2020 election is underway. Not just the campaign — the actual voting has already begun. States are recruiting and training poll workers, identifying the final list of polling places and early voting locations and mailing out ballots. The pandemic presents a huge challenge, but we can still ensure a safe and accessible vote this November. Here are six ways to make that happen. 1. Every voter must make a plan to vote. Now. Voters should start by checking their registrations by going to canivote.org. They should find out whether they can vote early, but in-person — that option will ease the burden of counting ballots on Election Day, since most states don’t allow for the early counting of absentee ballots. If they plan to go to the polls on Election Day, they should try to go in the middle of the day, when lines are less likely. If they plan to vote by mail and live in a state that is not mailing ballots to every voter, they should apply for absentee ballots as soon as possible. Then they must decide how to return that ballot — by mail, in a drop box, at a county office, or at a polling place — and track their ballots if their state provides a website to do so. In most years, absentee voters wait until the last minute to return their ballots, resulting in a backlog as Election Day approaches. Because 2020 may see three times more mail ballots cast than in any previous election, this backlog threatens to become gridlock. To avoid that, we need to “flatten the absentee ballot curve,” as our colleague Richard Hasen says. Voters should return their ballots as soon as they can. This will help  make sure that a rush of ballots does not hit election offices at the last minute — or even worse, too late to be counted.
