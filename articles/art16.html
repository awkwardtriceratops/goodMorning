By Eliza Shapiro Several weeks before Mayor Bill de Blasio shut New York City’s school system, the nation’s largest, amid a surge in coronavirus cases, he handed parents a daunting deadline: They had only a few weeks to decide if their children would return to classrooms this school year, and likely until at least next fall. This week, New Yorkers returned their verdict: Only about 35,000 children who had been learning remotely at the start of the school year asked to switch into some in-person learning whenever city schools reopen. The number of families choosing to return to classrooms represents both a major disappointment and surprise for the mayor, who has said he has a mandate from parents to reopen schools. Parents were asked to make the wrenching decision about how their children would learn for the rest of the school year while the threat of systemwide closure loomed. All city schools closed for in-person learning indefinitely on Thursday, though the mayor has vowed to reopen them as soon as possible. When schools do reopen, only about 335,000 students — nearly a third of the city’s roughly 1.1 million public schoolchildren — could learn in the school buildings that Mr. de Blasio spent months fighting to reopen. But that number could actually be lower when classrooms reopen. Students can switch from in-person to online learning at any time this school year, but the mayor has said they can no longer sign up for classroom instruction. The latest numbers came as many parents, educators and elected officials were mired in an intense debate about whether the city’s schools should had been closed at all. Yet the figures demonstrate that the conflict over in-person instruction is relevant for a minority of city families. That highlights a harsh reality for Mr. de Blasio’s administration, which has put schools at the center of the push to revive New York City and its economy after it became a global epicenter of the virus in the spring. And the fact that just under half of Black and Latino families have chosen to keep their children learning at home undermines the mayor’s argument that public school parents, who are overwhelmingly low-income parents of color, demanded open classrooms. The mayor had expected most children to return to school buildings because of the widely acknowledged inferiority of remote learning compared with in-person classes, and the enormous child care challenge that remote learning has created for working families. “I think if you went from March 2020 theoretically all the way to September 2021 and a kid never got into a classroom with an educator and caring adults that can help them, it would’ve been a massive mistake,” Mr. de Blasio said in a radio interview on Friday morning, before the new numbers were released. Now the mayor is presiding over a school system in which white children, who make up just 15 percent of the public school population, have had a disproportionate presence in classrooms during the pandemic. The most recent survey of parents indicated that white families were choosing remote learning at the lowest rates of any racial group. New York stands apart from the rest of the country for the enormous size of its public school system: The number of children set to return to classrooms is roughly equivalent to the total enrollment of Miami’s public school district, the nation’s fourth-largest.
