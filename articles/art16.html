The evening’s speakers will also include Kellyanne Conway, who is leaving the White House. Her legacy will include coining the phrase “alternative facts” two days after Mr. Trump took office to describe the administration’s spin. A team of New York Times reporters are following all the developments and fact-checking the speakers, providing context and explanation.   By Linda Qiu — Vice President Mike Pence Mr. Biden has a different concept of “school choice” than the Trump administration. He opposes the administration’s support for voucher programs that use taxpayer funds to pay for private school tuition, according to a spokesman, but he supports continuing federal funding for high-performing public charter schools. The Trump administration has in fact not succeeded in implementing its voucher programs because they have beemn blocked by Congress. By Sharon LaFraniere — Vice President Mike Pence The Food and Drug Administration on Sunday issued emergency use authorization that will expand the use of antibody-rich blood plasma to treat coronavirus patients. The decision will broaden use of a treatment that has already been administered to more than 70,000 patients. The data suggests that the treatment is most likely to benefit patients less than 80 years old who receive plasma with a high level of virus-fighting antibodies within three days of diagnosis. But the extent of the benefits was exaggerated during a White House news conference. Research showed that about seven in 100 patients would survive because of the plasma treatment — not 35 in 100, as President Trump and other administration officials said. Dr. Stephen Hahn, who heads the Food and Drug Administration, later corrected his assertions of the benefits of the treatment, saying he misspoke. Some experts have also sounded a note of caution, noting the data is preliminary and the results need to be verified by randomized clinical trials. By Ana Swanson — Vice President Mike Pence Mr. Biden has not publicly committed to repealing all of the tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed on more than $360 billion of Chinese products in the course of the trade war. Mr. Biden actually appears reluctant to commit either way to fully keeping or eliminating the tariffs, and his aides have said that he plans to evaluate the tariffs once in office based on their impact on the American middle class. Earlier this month, Mr. Biden had a confusing exchange about the tariffs with NPR reporter Lulu Garcia-Navarro. Mr. Biden appeared to respond “no,” when asked if he would keep the tariffs on China. The Trump campaign seized on the statement to say Mr. Biden would “scrap tariffs without any concessions.” But an aide said that Mr. Biden was actually responding to an earlier assertion by the reporter, that Mr. Trump’s stance was a “good one, to counter China’s influence.” By Linda Qiu — Vice President Mike Pence Vice President Mike Pence is taking Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s comments out of context. In a July discussion, the prominent liberal activist Ady Barkan asked Mr. Biden whether he would support redirecting “some of the funding for police into social services, mental health counseling and affordable housing.” Mr. Biden agreed and listed his proposals to increase funding for mental health clinics, more federal oversight of police departments, and restricting military equipment sold to the police. “But do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?” Mr. Barkan asked. “Yes, absolutely,” Mr. Biden responded. The published version of that conversation edited out some of Mr. Biden’s remarks that made his positions clearer. In the full version, provided to The Times by the Biden campaign, Mr. Biden emphasized that his proposals were “not the same as getting rid of or defunding all the police” and repeated that he believed federal grants to departments should be “conditioned.” By Coral Davenport — Vice President Mike Pence The United States has been a net exporter of coal since at least 1949. It became a net exporter of natural gas in 2017 for the first time in 59 years. In September 2019, it briefly became a net exporter of petroleum for the first time since monthly records began being kept in 1973, according to the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department. Earlier this year, the International Energy Agency projected that the United States could become a sustained net exporter of oil by late 2020 or 2021. By Mark Mazzetti — Former Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell When American surveillance aimed at gathering foreign intelligence information picks up information about an American — either because a target is speaking with an American, or because foreign targets are talking to other foreigners about an American — it is routine, for privacy reasons, to mask that American’s name in intelligence reports. It is lawful for officials to ask to “unmask” the names when it is necessary to understand the intelligence report. Documents that Mr. Grenell declassified earlier this year show that, during the presidential transition in 2017, someone in Mr. Biden’s office requested to know who an American was whose name had been redacted in an intelligence report. It turned out to be Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump’s incoming national security adviser. The request logged under Mr. Biden’s name came on January 12, not “three weeks before the inauguration” as Mr. Grenell said. And contrary to Mr. Grenell’s claim that Mr. Biden made this request, it could instead have been an adviser working in his office, because such requests are logged in the name of senior officials. Rather than a request to unmask Mr. Flynn, as Mr. Grenell put it, by definition the request was instead to learn who the unnamed  person was. By Katherine J. Wu — Vice President Mike Pence Hospitals across the nation experienced ventilator shortages when inundated with coronavirus cases in the spring, prompting local leaders to plead with the federal government for assistance. President Trump initially expressed skepticism about surging demand for hospital supplies. In March, for example, when Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York openly called for tens of thousands of ventilators from the federal government, Mr. Trump questioned the volume of the request. Some hospitals resorted to pairing two patients on one ventilator — a desperate and risky measure to alleviate shortages. By Lara Jakes and Eric Schmitt — Vice President Mike Pence In his 2014 book, Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War, the former Pentagon chief and C.I.A. director Robert M. Gates offered a scathing assessment of how the Obama administration handled the war in Afghanistan. Of Mr. Biden in particular, Mr. Gates said, “I think he’s been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. ” But Mr. Pence did not mention what Mr. Gates had written immediately before his criticism of Mr. Biden. “He’s a man of integrity, incapable of hiding what he really thinks, and one of those rare people you know you could turn to for help in a personal crisis,” Mr. Gates wrote of the then-vice president. By Edward Wong — Vice President Mike Pence Mr. Trump did not suspend all travel from China in his Jan. 31 announcement. There were notable exceptions to the ban. For example, American citizens and permanent residents were allowed to enter the United States even if they had been in China within 14 days before arrival. Close family members of American citizens were also allowed to enter the United States. Moreover, the travel ban had only a limited effect in stopping or lessening the spread of the novel coronavirus in the United States. The ban was porous — a New York Times analysis of data determined that nearly 40,000 travelers arrived in the United States on direct flights from China in the two months after Mr. Trump imposed his ban. Scientists have also found that the strain of the virus that began circulating in New York around mid-February was one that spread earlier in Europe, indicating it was carried by travelers from there. In any case, even with Mr. Trump’s partial travel ban on China, the United States has had one of the worst pandemic outcomes in the world, with deaths estimated to be as high as 200,000, about a quarter of the total worldwide. By Jeanna Smialek — Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law It is true that women’s unemployment hit the lowest level since roughly World World II before the pandemic, and it is also true that women took more than 70 percent of jobs added to the economy last year. Ms. Trump is right that women gained more than 4 million jobs between November 2016 and early 2020, but that was pre-pandemic: Since February, they have lost all of those jobs, and their employment is back at 2015 levels, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data. By Linda Qiu — Vice President Mike Pence The Veterans Choice Program was created in 2014 after the scandal of hidden waiting lists at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. Under the program, veterans who do not live within 40 miles of a department hospital or face wait times of more than 30 days for care could seek private health care funded by the government. In 2018, Mr. Trump signed a law that overhauled and consolidated Veterans Choice and other existing programs into a single Veterans Community Care Program. Under new rules, veterans who must drive for at least 30 minutes to one of the department’s facilities will be able to opt for private care, a less stringent requirement for many veterans. By Lara Jakes — Richard Grenell, former acting director of national intelligence The day that an accord went into effect in 2016 to limit Iran’s nuclear program, as brokered by the United States and other world powers, the Obama administration loaded a plane with $400 million in several currencies as a first installment of money long owed to Tehran. The money was part of $1.7 billion in assets, including interest, that the United States froze after Iran’s revolution in 1979 and that had been intended to pay for military hardware that the former shah in Tehran had purchased but that was never delivered. By Edward Wong — Richard Grenell, the former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell is trying to assert that President Trump always shows support for protests against authoritarian governments. Mr. Trump, who often praises dictators, has failed to express support for some of the most prominent such protests of the last three years. The most notable example is that of the pro-democracy protests that began in June 2019 in Hong Kong. Mr. Trump told Xi Jinping, the leader of China, on a telephone call that June that he and his aides would refrain from commenting on the protests if the Chinese government agreed to continue with trade talks, according to administration officials. John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, wrote in his new book that he heard Mr. Trump say of the Hong Kong protests that month: “I don’t want to get involved,” and, “We have human-rights problems too.” Mr. Bolton also wrote that Mr. Trump refused to issue a White House statement on the 30th anniversary of the Chinese military’s massacre of pro-democracy protesters around Tiananmen Square. “Who cares about it?” Mr. Trump said. “I’m trying to make a deal.” Mr. Trump has made a few comments on the protests in Belarus, where demonstrators say Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, the authoritarian leader, subverted a presidential election this month. But Mr. Trump did express support on Twitter in January for anti-government protests in Iran. The message appeared on his account in English and Farsi. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg — Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law While some progressive Democrats do want to “defund the police,” Mr. Biden is not among them. Since the police killing of George Floyd on Memorial Day, Mr. Biden has made calls for systemic changes to the country’s criminal justice system and proposed changes to police tactics. But he has said he opposes cutting resources for law enforcement — rather, he has proposed new funding for community policing, which a spokesman said would be conditioned on departments implementing reforms. He reinforced this sentiment on the opening night of the Democratic National Convention, taking pains to set himself apart from the left wing of his party. “Most cops are good,” Mr. Biden said then, “but the fact is, the bad ones need to be identified and prosecuted.” By Charlie Savage — Richard Grenell, former acting director of national intelligence Mr. Trump and his supporters — like Mr. Grenell, who Mr. Trump installed as the nation’s top intelligence official from February to May without Senate confirmation to be in that role — have sought to portray him as a victim of the counterintelligence investigation the F.B.I. opened in July 2016 into Russia’s covert operation to tilt the election in his favor. The investigation included an attempt to figure out whether anyone associated with the Trump campaign cooperated with that effort, wittingly or otherwise. In the course of that inquiry, the F.B.I. used several confidential human informants to approach Trump campaign associates to see what they would say about any advance knowledge of Russia’s hacking and release of Democratic emails. It also wiretapped Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser with many ties to Russian intelligence officials; by the time the F.B.I. applied for that warrant, the election was nearly over and Mr. Page had already left the Trump campaign, although wiretap orders permit the F.B.I. to look at any older emails in a target’s account. The purpose of this investigation was to understand the scope and nature of an effort by a foreign adversary to manipulate an American election. Calling it a “surveillance operation on the Trump campaign” connotes trying to gain an electoral advantage, but there is no evidence that any information gathered by the inquiry was provided to the Clinton campaign or leaked to affect the vote. Moreover, saying it was launched by the Obama-Biden administration suggests political appointees launched it, but the investigation was opened by career law enforcement officials and continued under the Trump administration. By Linda Qiu — Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law Lincoln did not famously say that. He didn’t say it at all. Fact checkers at PolitiFact and Snopes have noted that the quote comes from a viral image that circulated on Facebook. Here’s what Lincoln actually said, according to historians: “At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.” By Ana Swanson — Richard Grenell, former acting director of national intelligence. A bipartisan consensus has emerged in Washington that China poses a significant security and technological threat. And the Trump administration was able to garner bipartisan support for the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, a trade deal that replaced and updated the North American Free Trade Agreement. After undergoing some significant revisions by Democrats, the trade deal was approved in the Democratic-led House in December by a vote of 385 to 41. But Democrats would likely argue with the idea that Mr. Trump “led” them to these viewpoints. Some congressional Democrats, like Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have long been vocal critics of China. And some of Mr. Trump’s populist views on trade are more similar to ideas long held by labor unions and Democrats than the Republican Party. By Jonathan Weisman — Madison Cawthorn, Republican House candidate. Actually, James Madison did not sign the Declaration of Independence, nor did George Washington, John Jay, or Alexander Hamilton. By Katherine J. Wu — Representative Lee Zeldin of New York Testing for the coronavirus in the United States has been widely disparaged by experts across fields as inconsistent, insufficient and in some ways disastrous — sentiments that Mr. Zeldin’s comments don’t reflect. Turnaround times for results continue to stretch past a week in many parts of the country; supply shortages have hamstrung laboratories trying to process thousands of patient samples each day. Many diagnostic tests for the coronavirus are now approved for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration. But many of the companies that manufacture them are limited by production lines that were built for much more modest demand, and are struggling to ramp up. What’s more, guidance from the government on testing priorities has fluctuated and even reversed. Just this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed its recommendations on testing for people without symptoms, even those who have recently been exposed to known coronavirus cases. Federal officials said pressure to make the change came from higher-ups in Washington at the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services. By Jeanna Smialek — Burgess Owens, former N.F.L. player It’s true that Black and Hispanic workers did see record-low unemployment during the Trump administration before the pandemic hit, but women did not — they had lower unemployment in the 1950s. It is also difficult to judge whether the groups have seen “unprecedented prosperity.” Poverty has come down in recent years, and wages have risen. But inequality has also risen, and economic outcomes have often been uneven. For instance, participation rates — the share of adults who are actually in jobs or looking — has fallen across demographic groups. It is also worth noting that the same groups who made recent labor market gains have in many cases been the hardest hit economically during the pandemic, although that was the result of the shock that hit the economy rather than the administration’s labor-related policies. Minority workers, women and those with lower education levels faced heavy job losses as service industries shut down across much of the country.
