Bayern Munich and Lyon are playing in the UEFA Champions League semifinals in Lisbon. The winner will face Paris St.-Germain on Sunday in the final. TV: Wednesday’s game is being broadcast in the United States on the CBS All Access streaming service, and in Spanish on Univision. 46’ Boateng, who most definitely will be required in a final against P.S.G., departs and Niklas Süle comes on. The German commentary on the game notes that that wasn’t an expected change, but hints it may be more about resting him for the final than because of an injury. For Lyon, Thiago Mendes comes on in midfield for Guimaraes. Maybe he can do what Guimaraes could not. Rory Smith checks in at halftime: Lyon, at least, can take solace that it has given a rather better account of its abilities than RB Leipzig did on Tuesday night. Only slim solace, though, because the outcome is just the same. There is a pattern emerging from these semifinals — quite an obvious one, really, but still: clubs whose status dictates that they must be based around developing and selling young players cannot cope, head to head, toe to toe, with the teams who ultimately benefit from the development of those players.
