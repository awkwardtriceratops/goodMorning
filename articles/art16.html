So Far, It Is.<br></h1><p id="artcont">Wilson, the Aces forward, led Las Vegas to the No. 1 seed and won the W.N.B.A.’s Most Valuable Player Award. “It’s crazy to think that I’m just really honestly just scratching the surface.” By Howard Megdal A’ja Wilson found herself racing down the court midway through the third quarter, the last defense against Seattle’s Breanna Stewart and her full-court run to the rim. The Las Vegas Aces were up by 18 points, but Wilson didn’t give up on the play. “In my mind, it was like, I have to get a stop, because I was the cause of it,” said Wilson, who had turned the ball over, leading to the fast break. She blocked Stewart’s shot. Las Vegas landed the top seed in the playoffs on the strength of its two wins over the Seattle Storm, including that Aug. 22 game, and a surprising 16 more. They will begin a best-of-five semifinals against the Connecticut Sun starting on Sunday. Reaching this point was unexpected: After losing the All-Star center Liz Cambage (medical exemption) and the former No. 1 overall pick Kelsey Plum (Achilles’ tendon) for the season, it wasn’t clear how the far the Aces could go. But Wilson, who was named the league’s most valuable player on Thursday, is on a journey from “good to great to greatest,” said Dawn Staley, her coach at the University of South Carolina. Teammates have noticed that she doesn’t put her head down after a missed shot or blown defensive assignment, and she doesn’t stop competing. “She’s that leader for us now,” Aces forward Dearica Hamby said. “We play hard for her now.” The results have allowed Wilson, in her third season, to build on the stellar standard she’d set in her first two campaigns. Wilson, 24, won the 2018 Rookie of the Year Award after the Aces selected her No. 1 over all, then adjusted to the addition of Cambage in 2019. Las Vegas finished 21-13 last season, before losing to the eventual champion Washington Mystics in the semifinals. But with more room to operate this season without Cambage, Wilson has improved her numbers from her first two seasons: Blocks, rebounds, steals and field-goal percentage are up, but turnovers are down. That the absences of Cambage and Plum turned Las Vegas from a preseason favorite, alongside the Storm, to an afterthought fueled Wilson’s season as well. “I took it to heart,” Wilson said. “Because I felt like I was being disrespected, our team was being disrespected as a whole. Yes, Liz and K.P. are part of our puzzle, but they’re not the whole puzzle.” More than raw production, though, it has been the responsibilities laid at her feet that represent her biggest area of growth, according to Aces Coach Bill Laimbeer. “The first year was, ‘Oh my God, what is going on?’ ” Laimbeer said of Wilson’s outlook. “Second year, I really thrust a leadership role on her, and she had to do it — it wore her down in some games. But this year, she came with the focus that this is her basketball team — that she’s going to do what she has to do for this basketball team to be successful.” In many ways, this trajectory is a familiar one. Wilson won the Rookie of the Year Award in Year 1, and M.V.P. in Year 3 — just like Stewart, Elena Delle Donne and Tina Charles, whose talent level, said Laimbeer — who coached Charles with the Liberty — is within Wilson’s reach.
