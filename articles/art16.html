In spite of its stainless-steel countertops and the crew of line cooks in clogs and aprons and scullery caps cranking out the food each night, Prune was always meant to convey the feeling that there was just some gentle older woman back there in heavy stockings and a cardigan who had fixed you a plate from the pots on the stove. Some aspects of restaurant cooking — rigid requirements around quantity, consistency and hygiene, for example — could take the life out of certain dishes. Roast suckling pig. Apple pie. Spanakopita. You could never very successfully pull off a simple Sunday roast the way you would at home, where you season and brown and then slow-roast the leg of lamb, letting it rest on the counter for almost an hour before you carve it for supper. In restaurant protocol, you would have to rapid-cool, pre-portion and then reheat to order. But speedy and efficient and multitasking cooks, too, could create interference. There was always at least one prep cook who would want to use the razor-sharp mandoline held over a stainless bowl for all his slicing tasks in the name of efficiency and who would leave his heatproof silicone rubber spatula submerged in the beans he was asked to braise while he hustled other prep projects. I was so superstitious that the customer would be able to taste “refrigerator” in the food, or somehow notice the absence of what a good sharp knife’s steel blade against a wooden cutting board brings to the onions, that I would trail the cooks all day, and while they were making a quick trip to the walk-in, I’d swap out their mandoline with a knife and pull the silicone spatula from the beans, leaving a nice wooden spoon in its place, like the ones a nonna uses at home to stir the Sunday sauce. I learned this zucchini tian — the Provençal vegetable dish named for the earthenware vessel it’s meant to be cooked in — from my late ex-mother-in-law, Alda. She was the Italian nonna of a nearly lost era. She had to fire up the oven in her kitchen in Puglia by getting down on a knee with a box of stick matches, her eggs sat next to the ironing on a sideboard and her refrigerator barely dipped below 50 degrees — as if cold-holding were a kind of gesture, a good intention not always exactingly met. And her tian! So much with so little. She brought the vegetables home from the market in their waxy paper bags, the vegetables themselves picked from the gardens of the farmers that morning and taken directly to the town square under just a loose cover of burlap — not like here, where everything has to go into a refrigerated truck. She then peeled and sliced the vegetables already warm from the sun and assembled them in layers in her large, dented aluminum pans, baking the tian in the late morning to avoid having the oven on during the blistering part of the afternoon.
