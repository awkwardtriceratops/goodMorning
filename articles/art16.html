a Terrible Wildfire<br></h1><p id="artcont">Thomas Fuller/The New York TimesCredit... Supported by By Thomas Fuller and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs LAST CHANCE, Calif. — Even for Last Chance, a rugged community in the forests above the Pacific Ocean where residents mill their own lumber and grow their own food, Tad Jones was particularly ascetic. He shunned electricity and plumbing. He once spent a year living in the hollow base of a redwood tree. For decades he took a vow of silence, scrawling in notebooks or on a tiny chalkboard when he had something to say. If anyone could outsmart a wildfire, friends thought it would be Mr. Jones, 73. He had turned countless times to that same path, which leads to the Big Basin Redwoods State Park and its towering, 2,000-year-old trees. But the fire outmaneuvered him. A week after Mr. Jones disappeared down a fiery road on the night of Aug. 18, smoke still poured from fissures in the sandy soil in the forests. Along a narrow path at the edge of a steep ravine, rays of sunshine pierced the smoky haze and shone on the scorched shell of the minivan that Mr. Jones had used to try to flee. Mr. Jones’s escape was thwarted by a firestorm that ran so hot that it vaporized the windows of the van, melted the wheels and stripped all color from the surrounding forests, leaving acres of trees protruding from the ash-covered ground like so many burned matchsticks. The fire in Last Chance — one of hundreds of lightning-ignited fires that burned across Northern California and killed seven people — leveled all but a few of the 100 homes scattered along the six miles of Last Chance Road. It devastated a back-to-the land community established in the early 1970s that with its annual barn dance and its vegetable patches fed by spring water seemed to harken back to an earlier era. One of Mr. Jones’s neighbors survived the fire by submerging himself in his backyard pond. Another neighbor — the last man who spoke to Mr. Jones alive — spent an entire night in a clearing dodging flying fireballs until dawn, when he walked across six miles of burning forest to safety. For the last three decades, Mr. Jones, an Army veteran, lived in Last Chance in a wood cabin the size of a garden shed. He delighted in feeding the California quail, peacocks, blue jays — and foxes in the evenings.
