In April, he began brightening lives by playing jazz tunes from his apartment window. By Matina Stevis-Gridneff BRUSSELS — Simon Gronowski had committed many acts of bravery and generosity in his 89 years of life, and opening a window in April wouldn’t ordinarily have counted among them, but this was no ordinary April. It was the height of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, which hit Belgium as hard as any place in the world. But as a Holocaust survivor, Mr. Gronowski had faced death more intimately before. The diminutive lawyer summoned his courage, moved his electric piano to beneath a windowsill and flung the window open, letting in spring sunshine along with the thick, wary quiet of a city terrified of the virus. And he began to tap out a jazz tune. “I was afraid,” he said. “It’s not normal to just open the window and play.” But soon, his neighbors popped their heads out of their windows, some even donning masks and walking up to his house to hear better. One took a black-and-white picture of him playing, printed it and slipped it in his mailbox later, writing, simply, “Merci.” He began to play regularly, filling the leafy streets with jazz notes and bringing relief to his besieged neighbors throughout the lockdown that lasted into late May. Amy Edwards Anderson, an English teacher from the United States who has lived in Brussels for 22 years, first heard Mr. Gronowski play while sitting in her back yard with her husband and three children. She was surprised, she said, because it quickly became clear this wasn’t someone practicing the piano. It was someone performing for the block. The short window concerts burst into her family’s confinement and lifted them up. “Here was someone who was amplifying music to share with neighbors, for no other reason than to make people feel good during a difficult time,” she said. “A kind of unsolicited gift to the neighborhood.” Mr. Gronowski had meant for his impromptu concerts to make people happy, but playing for others has also had intrinsic value for him his entire life. “Music is a means of communication, of connection,” he said on a recent afternoon in his home office, surrounded by piles of documents. Mr. Gronowski taught himself how to play the piano as a teenager, because he, too, was seeking to communicate, to connect, first and foremost, with his older sister, Ita, who had perished in Auschwitz in 1943, age 19.
