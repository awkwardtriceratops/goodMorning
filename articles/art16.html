By Erin Berger Hundreds of thousands of sweaty, athleisure-clad national park visitors have entered the park gift shop after a hike and immediately gravitated toward one particular display: the vintage-looking magnets, postcards and posters with the park’s name in blocky lettering, its best-known vista or features rendered in simple contours and pastels. The style, which has become shorthand for old-school travel posters, can be traced back to one series of 14 posters, created for 13 parks and monuments in the 1930s and ’40s by Works Progress Administration artists. But those original designs were almost completely lost to time and neglect. Most of the credit for their survival lies with a bespectacled, retired backcountry dentist named Doug Leen who homesteads on an island in southeast Alaska. (“I should probably get going, my tide’s just about in,” he said at the end of one interview, hanging up to pilot his boat into town for some errands.) Mr. Leen, 74, has made it his life’s work to track down as many of the original W.P.A. national park posters as he can, after they were scattered across the country for 70 years with few records. He also reproduces original 1930s posters and nods to the W.P.A. aesthetic in 32 contemporary designs. Turn over a W.P.A.-style postcard sold at a national park, and it almost certainly bears the logo of his company, Ranger Doug’s Enterprises. After the Great Depression, the New Deal’s W.P.A. employed Americans in a variety of public works. That included the Federal Art Project, which patronized upward of 10,000 artists from 1935 to 1943, among them Diego Rivera, the muralist, and Selma Burke, the sculptor. About a third were considered practical artists, fulfilling orders for stage sets or posters about shows (“8 Roof Garden Concerts at Jamaica YMCA”) and venereal diseases (“Public Enemy No. 1: Syphilis”). These artists had less than romantic views of their work, making about $23 per week and juggling multiple projects, much like the freelancers of today. They worked quickly and often in media unrelated to what would now be called their “skill set.” “You’ll read interviews with former W.P.A. workers and they’re, like, ‘I had a background in painting pictures on fine china,’” said Tracy Baetz, the chief curator of the U.S. Department of the Interior Museum. “Great. You’re an artist. Come help us out.” Many of the posters reveal a playful sensibility and global influences such as Bauhaus design from Germany and drawing styles from Mexican murals. None of these visual techniques were new or uniquely American, but they’ve stuck in the way things do with time and repetition. The posters were treated as advertising, screenprinted into hundreds of copies and eventually into the American imagination. “These were handmade, artistic representations of graphic design in our country, but nobody knew that at the time,” said Ennis Carter, a curator and the author of “Posters for the People: Art of the WPA.” The National Park Service was 19 years old when the Federal Art Project started, and visitation numbers were much lower than they are now. After the Depression and with a crude highway system, Americans were unlikely to go out of their way to public lands. So the F.A.P. offered ways to advertise the parks and provide visitors with educational materials showing their value. Thirteen N.P.S. sites, including Zion, Yosemite and the Grand Canyon, ordered posters from a catalog sent out by the Western Museum Laboratories, a work space for several W.P.A.-funded projects, and got at least 100 copies apiece. A white box appears on many of the prints, where employees could post notices about offerings like guided hikes. “It was never intended to be valuable in 80 years,” said Nancy Russell, the archivist for the National Park Service History Collection. “It was intended to be stuck up on the bulletin board. They got rained on, messed up and tossed out.” Of the 35,000 posters created during the W.P.A., only about 2,000 have been found and cataloged, and just a fraction of those are national park prints. In 1970, Mr. Leen was a ranger at Grand Teton National Park’s Jenny Lake Ranger Station, adding to the burn pile at a horse barn during the annual all-hands cleanup day. He spotted a poster on the wall: “Meet the Ranger Naturalist at Jenny Lake Museum,” it read over a blue-tinted scene of Cascade Canyon. “It was so well done,” Mr. Leen said. “It had this old luster to it.”
