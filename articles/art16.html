Mayor<br></h1><p id="artcont">Kathryn Garcia, the sanitation chief, is the third woman to emerge as a candidate to succeed Bill de Blasio. Men were the main contenders until this spring. By Dana Rubinstein Kathryn Garcia, one of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s most trusted cabinet members, resigned on Tuesday from her post as sanitation commissioner in anticipation of a potential run for mayor of New York City. If Ms. Garcia formally enters the race to succeed Mr. de Blasio in 2021, she will be the third administration veteran — all of them women — to run for the job or consider doing so. Mr. de Blasio’s former top counsel, Maya Wiley, resigned from her position at MSNBC to prepare a mayoral run. Loree K. Sutton, who ran New York City’s Department of Veterans’ Services under Mr. de Blasio, announced her candidacy last year.
